 This is Paul. This is a Friday morning, January 27. I'm not doing a Bridges of Meaning Discord question and answer. That will probably come next week, Friday. I'm doing those once a month. But I was in Wheatland yesterday. Wheatland is a town that is just south of Olivehurst and Yuba City. I didn't know there was anything in Wheatland. When the message came through that Jordan Peterson was coming to Wheatland, I didn't pay any attention to it because I frankly didn't remember that it was anywhere near Sacramento. But then a friend of mine who's been a friend for a long time said, oh, let's go to the Jordan Peterson event. I've been to five other live events of his. I thought, oh, okay. I did a lot just to have some time with my friend because we hadn't seen each other for a while. We'd get some good car time and we could talk. We're going to have dinner together. We met at a certain place and we drove up with him. This was the best live presentation I've seen Jordan Peterson give. I thought it was really good. He was strong. He was sharp. He was funny. I thought I'd run down the evening a little bit, run down his talk. I took some notes on his talk. Afterwards, I had a chance to meet with Jordan and Tammy. I thought I'd give a rundown on that. Then after I give my little rundown, I'll drop the link and we can open it up to some question and answer and some live chat. The venue, maybe I should pull it up. Let's see how sharing the stream goes here on StreamYard. Let's see, where can I put this? I'll put this down here. Present. Might still be there. Let's try this. There it is. Good. Here's Sacramento way down below here. Maybe I'll make myself small as part of this is just learning StreamYard. I really like it. It's been proving well. Here's Sacramento. This is the city I live in. I live down in this area. This is the pocket. I live on the other side of the pocket by this park here. That's where the church is. I live quite close to the church. If you drive up, 99 turns into 70 and you go to this Hard Rock Live, which I don't know if it's an Indian casino or because it's a full-fledged casino and it's a massive place in the middle of nowhere. When I heard Jordan was coming to Wheatland, I was thinking, what's in Wheatland? My friend and I, we buck through traffic and we're running a little late and we wanted to have dinner together. We go in there and he said, yeah, I tried calling for reservations at the cafe and they said, oh, we didn't need any. They don't take reservations, but there's plenty of space. Then we get in there and the people like, our wait. It's like, well, we don't have an hour before the show. We said, well, what other places can we eat? Well, there's a noodle place here and then there's a coffee shop place here. Went to the noodle place. That looked like an hour wait. Then we went to the coffee shop and all of the hot things like hot dogs and cheese steaks, they were a half hour wait. We didn't have a half hour. Well, what's cold? Well, tuna fish sandwiches. My friend and I sat down and ate tuna fish sandwiches and we had a lovely talk, just reconnecting and sharing our stories. Then we went into the venue and Sacramento for California is sometimes hard for people to understand. The Central Valley, California is an enormous diverse state and when people away from California think about California, they easily, oh, now I'm putting up ads for this place. All right, get rid of this. Get rid of this. When people think about California, they think about Southern California, Hollywood beaches. They think about Silicon Valley, the Bay Area, but almost the rest of the state is sort of American West and Sacramento and the Central Valley, huge agricultural areas. Sacramento, of course, is the state capital of the state of California and it's a very, very diverse city, diverse in so many different ways. You do have some tech and you do have some bedroom communities, people wanting to have a little bit more affordable housing instead of the high prices of the Bay Area, but you've got a lot of ag and you get just outside of the city and it's very country. It was interesting being there because, like I said, I've been to, this was my sixth live Jordan Peterson event. The first live Jordan Peterson event, I think, was in maybe February or April of 2018 and it was a little event in San Francisco called the simulation and you can find the video of it on YouTube still. Rick was there and some other people from the meetup were there and it was a small event. We had a good time. It was maybe four or 500 people in there. The second Jordan Peterson event that I went to was in Sacramento. There's a downtown theater in Sacramento that he had it in and that was like 2,500 people. The third event was in San Jose. Our meetup again went down there and that was a big venue again, you know, over 2,000 people. The fourth event was in the same place that the first event was in San Francisco. This was associated with an organization that I know in the Bay Area and so that's when we had a really big meetup in anticipation of that. The fifth event was in Santa Rosa that Rick and I went to and we met Jordan Peterson backstage and Rick and I and Tammy had a lovely chat and so I let Jordan know that I was going to be at this event and he said, oh meet me backstage and so we did that and myself and my friend and Jordan and Tammy and had a wonderful few minutes with him. Like I said, this was, I thought, the best event and I'll talk about some of the reasons why I think it was the best event and then I'll take your questions after. Like I said, here are my notes. I don't expect any of you can probably read them even if I make them really large. I took them on my phone and so the evening started off, so the crowd was, the percentage of women in these crowds, at least from the events that I've seen, is continuing to grow. A lot of couples and again because we were north of Sacramento, this was, the name of the town is Wheatland and it's a casino, so it was a very country audience. Usually when you go to these Jordan Peterson events, a lot of the hardcore Jordan Peterson fans dress up nicely, though they're wearing, you know, some are coming in three-piece suits. I try to dress a little better than I do. Normally you get to see how I usually dress. In the winter I wear this thing and in the summer it's just shirts, but yeah, more women. Women were very enthusiastic at the event. Women were very enthusiastic at the event, I'll have to say that. The demographic was definitely sort of country California rather than more urban California, which has been in San Francisco and San Jose. Like I said, Sacramento's sort of a mixture of country urban California and yeah, the crowd was big. I didn't, I don't know how many was there. Just looking at the room over 1500, maybe over 2000, it was a big room. It's a big venue. Again, it's sort of in a casino venue, which was interesting and my friend was like, you know, weren't hardly any tickets left when he grabbed our tickets and it seemed that the whole place was sold out. I did some reflection again on this because, you know, when Jordan sort of arose in 2017 and his first book tour was 12 Rules for Life, you know, you expect, okay, it's a big book, it's a big splash, it's a cultural moment. Will this thing fade? It's not fading. This was not the most, obviously not the most well-known venue, not a venue in the heart of it. Sacramento's a medium-sized American city and this is, you know, it's, this is 30 minutes out of town to the north out past the airport, almost to Yuba City, Olivehurst and these are, that's, Yuba City is more like a town than a city. Olivehurst is a sort of a bedroom community of Yuba City. He had this place packed and, you know, as a preacher, I mean, what he does is so akin to, in some ways, a religious event and even though he had a few, this was by no means, it's so tortured because I, you know, I watched the Twitter chatter about Jordan and people are always attacking him because of his politics and he, you know, he likes to talk politics, he has political conversations on his videos, but these, this event that I was with and I'd say almost all of the events and some of the early events when Dave Rubin was sort of opening for him, Dave Rubin made it more political, but this was, this was Jordan Peterson about responsibility, about God, about love, about a lot of theodicy in this talk and I'll get into that because I actually thought there were a lot of really interesting aspects of, of theodicy in this talk and he made a lot of interesting points. So it's hard to, it's hard to kind of frame and categorize these events. They're, they're in many ways religious and it was this, obviously this religious quality to what was happening in 2016 and 2017 that drew my attention and the religious hunger of his audiences that of course very much grabbed my attention and you know, I'm still here and a lot of people are still here. I know with YouTube churn, people come and go and you listen to a variety of people and sometimes you watch them a lot and sometimes you watch someone else a lot and there's, that's just sort of the normal YouTube churn, but for Jordan to continue doing these events, today he's talking to Joe Rogan. So I imagine later this afternoon, I don't know, I'm not a, I don't watch, especially since Joe Rogan went to Spotify, I don't watch a lot of Joe Rogan. I count on you all to point out videos to me, things that Joe Rogan says that will be of interest to me, but so he's talking to Joe Rogan today and he said recently at a big announcement, before the event there was, there were some big screens and before the event there was some, there were some commercials, a significant commercial for Essay and you know, this has always been sort of a family affair and I'll talk about Tammy in a few minutes, but Michaela obviously, a sizable podcaster and YouTuber in her own right now, but Julian hasn't much been in the mix and Julian is really at the center of this Essay project and from the promo, Julian identified as a software engineer and you know, you remember the early days of 2016-2017 when Jordan's struggling with his tech and Julian, Julian comes in and fixes, fixes his stuff for him. Well, Jordan starts out talking about his experience of working with students to have them write a decent coherent essay and so what it appears Essay is, is a software platform that helps people structure, organize and edit their writing. Now I've played with some of these kinds of platforms before because I am such an ADHD writer that I really need some structure so I'll, gosh, you know, I buy three or four, I buy three or four copies of every Jordan, every one of Jordan's book. I wind up with the physical book, the audio book and the Kindle book so I'll try out this Essay thing. You know, Jordan got me into Daily Wire so Eric Hamilton, right when the Daily Wire deal came down, I mentioned it on Twitter and Eric Hamilton said, this means Paul van der Klay is going to subscribe to Daily Wire plus and yeah, I said, I don't know if I will but then of course I did. So Essay looks interesting, that could be the announcement that Jordan makes. Peterson Academy, then the second sort of promo that was on the screen. I know that John Vervecky has recorded for Peterson Academy, I know that Jonathan Pigeot has recorded for Peterson Academy so I don't know any of the others. I talked to John Vervecky both about Peterson Academy and oh, what's the name of the, what's the name of Stephen Black, his university that he's got in South Carolina and you know, Peterson Academy is new, it hasn't really rolled out yet, we're gonna have to find out the details of that. Well, I go back to school with Peterson Academy, might happen, who knows but so John Vervecky and Jonathan Pigeot and Jordan are all doing things for Peterson Academy and you know, Jordan and Michaela have talked about sort of the cringe factor of calling it Peterson Academy but it's from a marketing position, it's kind of the most obvious way to go if Jordan is going to follow through with part of his ambition to remake university education. So a couple little clips, couldn't really get a sense from that, we'll have to see how Peterson Academy does. You know, ThinkSpot didn't pan out, it's the way it goes with trying new things, you know, some things pan out, some things don't. I think despite the frustration that many people have of Jordan Peterson material being behind the DailyWire plus paywall, I think now a number of months into it, which I call sort of wave three, I think generally speaking the DailyWire plus thing is going well for Jordan and certainly the technical aspects of his productions are excellent, consistently excellent, especially you know, the sound and the video, so yeah, that seems to be going well for him. So those two promos and then this time for the first time, they had the opening act was a solo guitar player, beautiful, beautiful, well mic'd, I mean in a hall like a casino show hall, you know, they've got the sound and the lights all perfectly dialed in, they have to, they do music and sorts of things. You know, I went there with my friend and neither of us had ever been there and after I got there, so I'm like, oh yeah, this is sort of like Lake Tahoe flatland, that's basically what it was. So beautiful guitar music, part of the reason again for opening acts is because, and every preacher knows this, people are invariably late to events and so you have an opening act to give people time to get into the room and so that the people who are sitting waiting for the latecomers to all assemble have something nice to listen to and so the classical guitarist went for, I don't know, 15 minutes or so, nice blend, apparently this guy's touring with Jordan, so he's now Jordan's opening act in the world tour. So and then after that, Tammy came out and when I saw Jordan in Santa Rosa, Tammy opened the act there too and I find Tammy just delightful, I think she's a, I think Jordan with Tammy, I think Jordan with Tammy is better than Jordan alone, it is not good for the man to be alone. Tammy softens Jordan, I think she sort of keeps him grounded, I think, yeah, Tammy's, I think it's great that they're touring together because I think she does make Jordan better. So and she opens with sort of a story and she kind of in very brief strokes went through C16 and all of what that brought and then she didn't talk much about their illnesses or her really miraculous recovery or Jordan's semi-miraculous recovery. Jordan was stronger and fitter and sharper than I've ever seen him in a live event and maybe than I've ever seen him even on video. He looked really good, he looked really strong, he seemed really healthy, the guy's an energizer bunny, I mean he just goes and goes and goes and goes and if you've ever been to these events, this is what he does and so he, you know, the event sort of starts at 7 30, he gets on stage by about eight o'clock, the guitarist was about 15 minutes, Tammy was about 15 minutes and you know he does this and then he'll sometimes meet people off stage afterwards just briefly and then he goes and does the meet and greet and he had, he mentioned that he had dinner with someone before that, you just get the sense that the guy is just people, people, people, people, people, people, people, people and he's recording videos and he's talking to people and like this morning, I'm sure he's flying down to LA and he's on Joe Rogan and he'll probably have another meeting. Tammy had said that in her opening act, she said that she was looking forward to going back home because of her grandchildren and I, who have five children, none of them married yet but four of the five with significant others, I'm sure the fifth will have one at some point, one of the things that I really look forward to someday is grandchildren and so when Tammy said that, it warmed my heart. So she talked about you know life, a little bit of life with Jordan and then talked about how Michaela used to open but then Michaela's busy, she has a daughter, she has a podcast, she runs Jordan's business, she manages Jordan's brand so she can't travel with him and then Jordan asked her and it was, that's what I put in my notes, he asked me, let's see if I can make these larger and I don't seem to, it doesn't seem to have the same functionalities, oh it does kind of, oops, okay, yeah this is, this is, this is like the Grim Grizz show, you know, I'm showing all the live stream, live stream warts and all, there we go, that's, oh, I'll show it, okay, there we go, now I'm gonna move the camera a little bit, I'm not, I don't have anywhere near the real insightful memes that Grim seems to be able to pull up in a moment so it's just a delightful moment in the story where you know, I think, I can imagine for Tammy, Jordan, Jordan's fame, I, Jordan's fame has to be a stress on the marriage because you know, Jordan, there's all these things vying for Jordan's attention and I remember, it was either in a video or at a live event, Tammy, when Jordan sort of skyrocketed, Tammy mentions, maybe Michaela mentioned Tammy saying this, you know, I'm afraid we've lost him and sort of lost him to the crowd and lost him to the, to everything going, I can't believe he just mocked my not coughing tick, is that what that is, Chris? I thought that was a, I thought that was sort of a genius, I thought that was just sort of a genius gimmick, it's a not coughing tick, well that's pretty sharp, so Tammy made a comment and one thing basically saying, you know, I, I, I thought, you know, I thought we'd lost him and so losing Jordan to the crowd would be a very real possibility and the answer to this of course for Tammy is stick with him, go on tour with him and Jordan and Tammy are remarkably transparent for people in the kind of controversy they are in and that's a quality I continue to find endearing and authentic about the two of them, so, so she tours with him and she opens with him and she said, you know, this isn't, this isn't something, she talked about how she used to do massage therapy but she got arthritis in her hands and so she couldn't do it anymore and, but now she's touring and now she's opening and she of course has, she of course has her own podcast, I told her that I thought her interview with Louise Perry was the best Louise Perry book interview that I've seen, Tammy asked questions that either no other interviewer would ever think of asking or would dare to ask and I covered some of that in the marriage, marriage crisis, the latest marriage crisis video, so, so, so she was just delightful telling some little stories, you know, mentioned Jordan Peterson Academy, talked about storytelling and then she went into rule number two, you know, opportunity, you know, an opportunity overlooked is basically responsibility abdicated and right away I started about thinking about the word responsibility because responsibility comes from the word respond and, and actually this word, I'd love to see Jordan Peterson dig into this word more in his lectures because if you follow enough Jordan Peterson lectures just like any public speaker, especially who's speaking like this and I know this because in many ways my videos are like this, you'll have these little hobby horses that you're on, I remember when I first started following Tim Keller around 2006, he was, you know, contrasting gospel with religion, you know, he'd write a book about that, most speakers go through these little phases where they have these little sub narratives and subroutines that they sort of dwell on as they're sort of mentally working through things and so Jordan in a lot of his more recent speeches has been talking about responsibility even though he has but responsibility is always a response to this call and Rick just sent me a text this morning where he linked the Jerusalem interview that Chad had put in his Friday morning nameless a few days ago and I posted that on Twitter and some people were real smart snarky about it but that's Twitter I suppose but I so I listened to actually that this morning on my way to work here and yeah I should probably do some commentary on that because I think, I think again that was unlike sort of the the Ephesus speech which was longer, this was a really nice tight compact presentation of some of Jordan's main concern right now and it nicely sort of brought together different, different aspects of his work. So Tammy talked about Rue Le Toul a little bit, Jordan talked about the fact that it's rather overwhelming to come on stage and I was thinking, I was doing a lot of thinking about that maybe when I jump into the live when I jump into the live segment of this show I'd like to hear from some of you about all of the people that come to this place can and most of them certainly have listened to dozens if not hundreds if not thousands of hours of Jordan Peterson for free on YouTube yet they pay real money, these events aren't cheap, they pay real money and some of them even realer money for the the full-fledged VIP you know 45 second handshake meet and greet take a picture thing why do we do that, why do we do that? So and Jordan said basically you know it's rather overwhelming to be here and maybe when it stops being overwhelming it's time to quit and I thought oh that's that's right that's right. He talked about partaking in discussions, we talked about Kierkegaard, Dostoevsky, talked about notes from the underground, talked about you know not happiness, talked about adventure, then went went into Abraham and you know a lot of so it was interesting because afterwards he said to Tammy I wasn't really sure what sure I was going to talk about tonight so Tammy sort of got him going they probably talked about riffing on rule two because ostensibly these events are book tours even though they're not really book tours he's much more like sort of a meaning crisis circuit rider and circuit riders were preachers on the American frontier that would ride horses to place to place to place to place to give these revival gospel co gospel talks and and in many ways this book tour is just sort of a meaning crisis circuit riding tour very adoring audience now people love him again this audience was older more couples more country San Francisco audience tended to be younger techie more predominantly male more nerdy again this was more country San Francisco tends to be more nerdy so he talked about Abraham God being the spirit that calls to adventure and also you've heard Jordan talk about studying stand-up comics I've mentioned before that back in my church planting days we because Peterson is a rock star for grown-ups Rick says yeah yeah ask ask Rick how he almost ruined the tour ask Rick how he almost ruined the tour when he with what he said to Jordan Peterson I'll let I'll let Rick tell that story I can't read the comments because I'm already way too distracted only by my own thoughts and when I'm distracted by all of your thoughts it's even worse Jordan was talking about how he studied stand-up comics back in the days when I was very involved with church planting that was also sort of a piece of church planter training getting people to study stand-up comics why if you watch I only watched like the first couple seasons of Miss Maisel which is supposed to sort of be based on Joan Rivers which is very interesting so in the first couple seasons of Miss Maisel they really go into sort of what's what's at stand-up comic and what stand-up comics do is they go from place to place to place they go from place to place to place to place and they they basically work their act and they find out what lines get reaction and there's no better way to know to figure out what you have is good than to go crowd after crowd after crowd and see what consistently works well so I got home last night after the event and I had still way too much adrenaline flowing through me because I had a terrific evening at the event I had a terrific evening with my friend and so when I got home a little before midnight I was all hyped up so I couldn't go to sleep and Jacob was doing his just chatting thing or his little doggy cam whatever crazy stuff he's doing now so I hopped on with Jacob and I talked about this and Jacob says you know you're he said to me you know you're too you have to understand that these live events for Jordan and I'm going to rephrase Jacob a little bit are really helpful for him to hear the crowd and I think recalibrate to not lose touch with the crowd now of course there's opponent processing between touch with the crowd and audience capture and that's part of the dangers of circuit riding or being an itinerant preacher or being a circuit rider for the meaning crisis but he's so if you go to one of these events sort of it's again it's sort of like you know Rick says it's a rock star a rock concert for adults Rick is right in that when you go to one of these events people coming to it want to hear all the same old songs I mean you can still go to like these these bands that don't even have the same musicians in that they used to have but they're still on tour because the record company owns the name and they sing all the familiar songs I remember going to one of these downtown I don't remember why we went to it was because of one of my kids or something but you know I was surrounded by people slightly older than me singing to a rock band that has long since passed but the the whole point of being there is to sing the songs together it's to play along and and again for me that's a big part of this little corner of the internet is I I'm I'm happy with Jordan being as big as he is but I want there to be enough small spaces so that we can all play along and I think you know we've done that on discord and various discords and now we're doing that with stream yard and Jacob's just chatting and grim grizz is live stream you know it's and you know mark with navigating patterns I think Cassidy said that sort of um Fridays I think about noon California time which is quite a bit later Netherlands time where she's living Cassidy might have a live stream and so part of what I think we want what I think the the discord um was helpful with and a helpful stage and that was was virtually not alone and of course grim grizz is is actually pioneering grim grizz is way more important than the size of his channel as is Jacob as is Nate as is Sam as is all of these other as is Karen as is Seville all these other smaller channels sort of in this little network and I'm really glad there's all these smaller channels in these little networks and that these these channels attract different audiences so Nate and grail country they attract a certain audience grizz attracts a certain audience Jacob attracts a certain audience Jacob's audience like my local meetup is terribly low in agreeableness because Jacob is one of those classical very low and agreeableness people so you know what we're doing is we have this little ecosystem where we can play along and a big part of these big events is so that people can have a sense of participation in the movement that's why they're that's why activists march and have rallies that's why there are political rallies and that was something that Trump you know figured out Trump of course is a someone he's a master marketeer and so figuring out the rallies and figuring out Trump figured out that rallies work for him but political conventions are the same way people want to play along they want to be involved they want to participate and all of these little channels that we have here are ways to participate you can jump in and talk to grizz you can jump in and talk to to to Chad you can jump in and talk to Jacob and Nate and you know lots of the other channels doing this so this is this is this is part of what we what we really want to do so Jordan in that sense like a stand-up comic has a lot of his regular lines and a lot of his regular stories and for those of us who've been listening to Jordan intensively for years now I've heard many of these stories and there's always sort of a back and forth so he's got to have both some new material to keep the long-term people engaged but also some familiar stories that work sort of accumulated like a stand-up comic too because these will be crowd pleasers and these will give the people a sense of participation and engagement which is why they bought the expensive ticket and why they drove or flew to the event and why they brought their spouses and their kids and why they they're they want to be there even if most of what they hear they've heard before and they're okay with that they're just like what what um Dire Straits that was a was a Dire Straits Rick would have the right name for this like a Dire Straits legacy band um and and you know again all these baby boomers who maybe didn't get a chance to go to concerts when they were young because they weren't in the right place and didn't have the money and weren't cool enough but have been listening to this band's music for 30 years now and their 60 plus year old bodies they're dancing and yeah there's a cringe factor to all of this I get that but um let's not be so high and mighty that we're above a little bit of cringe I mean I think in some ways um Grim Grizz has has you know perfected the art of cringe so his shows are electric it's true it's true sultans of swing that's right so let me in on the trolley it's my specialty meta jester says all right so where was I I distracted but so so yeah Abraham spirit that calls I mean we've heard this again and again and again and you'll you'll hear it a dozen more times and then he nicely connected adventure and faith and I thought that was a really good departure from the celebrity atheist line that faith is beliefs that you don't have evidence for that is that is such a poor attempt to define a word and and I think I think Jordan I mean a big part of the meaning crisis is faith in being that being is good now yeah I know a lot of Christians will hear that and say that's sort of a watered down yep it's watered down it's abstracted it's way out there but I think if you believe and I asked I asked John Vervecke this directly at one point on video you know is being good neutral or negative if you say being is good you are within an inch of being a theist and Jordan believes being is good and John Vervecke believes being is good now I think if you're a hardcore atheist the best you can go is being is neutral and if you're a nihilist being is negative being is evil being is wrong and these conversations go way way back into the classical period gnosticism being is good being is good all kinds of all kinds of ancient philosophical movements so connecting a call to responding to the spirit of adventure with faith yeah that's good that's really good and and he mentioned that and it's it's quite true people people sometimes regret the decisions they made but they more often regret never having tried and I think about my years in the dr and I was high in high so high in conscientiousness that I work work work and I think back and some of my friends who you know were working for habitat for humanity or other little mission projects who lived in the little town that I did you know they would take more time to drive out to the beaches to to spend more time recreating now I also had a kid so that impacted our our freedom but um when I think back over those years most of my regrets are about risks that I didn't take and I think I think Jordan really nailed that what most people to the end of their life look back and look at risks they didn't take now sometimes people look back and see risks they did take that were unwise risk and that's part of the sort of there's a tick-tockness to these things the tick is have a bias towards action and risk taking the talk is do so with wisdom because you really need both and then he went into theodicy which was very interesting because he got into sort of reality and faith because first he connected faith to the call to adventure and then he went into a very interesting section where he connected opponent processing and you know he he closed the evening with thank you for your time and attention and I thought this this little corner is having an influence I'm gonna take off my coat I'm getting warm static electricity he ended with thank you for your time and attention and I thought yeah he's been spending time with John Verbeke so he starts talking about opponent processing and starts talking about the fact that and it's true if you look at he didn't talk a lot about this but it made me think of it which is a little preacher trick for those of you who are preachers or public speakers who want to do this thing people less remember the words that you say and more remember the thoughts that you had that were provoked by their words and that's the same for my videos people will often in a randos conversation or a question answer say well didn't you say and I think no I didn't really say that but I can understand what I said that provoked that thought in you so he's talking about opponent process body and if you look at almost all of our arms even the way our muscles are arranged they're all sort of against each other so that that's how I can control my arm and he talked about the fact that if you have to do something really precise with your hand it's sort of hard because it's unopposed but if you want to hold your if you want to hold your hand real still for a while it might be difficult it's a lot easier if you have two hands together because of the opponent processing and our muscles work that and our brains work that again the the brain science that compares us to chimps verveke talked about this at the beginning of one lecture somewhere chimps that was his lecture in eastern europe chimps are no dumber than us and they might in fact be in some way smarter than us but what they don't have in their brain is as much I can't remember the technical word for it it's basically resistance inhibition we are far more inhibited than chimps and what that says is that to a degree in terms of our cognition there's a lot more opponent processing in our cognition and that makes us smarter and so he talked about and this part was really good he talked about suffering and how suffering and frustration and opposition optimizes challenge for us and helps us to level up and again anyone who plays video games knows this leveling up dynamic where you know there's a there's a phrase I'm going to quote the book of mormon I can't believe it I'm going to quote the book of mormon because my homeless friend who's a mormon and so often he's a broken record and I know my knowledge of the mormon religion is about a hundred memes deep but those hundred memes have been told to me thousands of times and so this my mormon friends a favorite line from the book of mormon there must be opposition in all things and that's basically opponent processing and Jordan makes the point that for us to actually mature and grow strong and develop you can even think about this with respect to weightlifting or or physical training it's all about opponent processing and there being resistance to our efforts and you you know this with a spoiled kid a spoiled kid is someone who has never suffered and in fact my friend and I who went we we had been talking quite a bit about that because you know we've um and we've known each other for a long time and and both of us have shared some suffering and shared our own individual suffering with each other and so I do know that when friendships have grown because there has been shared suffering those friendships are deeper so he talked about that and he talked about how in some ways and this is true we are all pushed to our limits by the evil in this world and and why would God allow suffering maybe to grow us up but now and and so then he talked about how when you get to chaos and order what you're really doing is dancing on the edge and I thought about that and and it's true I mean we we sort of seek the edge and we sort of see whatever edge we're pursuing and of course there's lots of ideals and lots of hierarchies but we sort of seek the edge and right there at the edge and the the place where chaos and order meet that's where there's sort of optimization and that's really where there's progress and development and advancement and that's true and so theodicy he connected the odyssey with dancing on the edge and it's at that point that I had um you know and consciousness is like dancing on the edge another one of his lines chaos and order optimized and he mentioned this as a solution for the problem of suffering and I thought about that and I thought yes to a degree if the individual is maximized and he talked about the fact that in order for there to be a real world there has to at least be the very real danger and the very real danger of failure and suffering now if there's going to be the very real danger of failure and suffering that means that there has to be real failure and suffering and when you think about let's say video games you die in video games and then you respawn and maybe the video game tries to add a little element of suffering by you have to wait 20 seconds before you can respawn you can't respawn automatically instantly and so it's just a little bit of resistance that's built into the video game so let's say it's a team game and you're playing call of duty or world of warcraft and you have to wait to respond and you're seeing some of your mates and your your your team members getting getting shellacked by the opposition and you're just frustrated because you want to get in there I mean even when we played paintball for jesus up in thunder bay I should mention early on um set aside the weekend of may 19 20 and 21 chino california conference about a quest for a spiritual home the quest for a spiritual home we're still working on the title but that seems to be the way it's going um and there will be paintball for jesus there tickets are not yet available whenever tickets are available I'll let you know when tickets are available we're going to have a an anticipatory conversation between myself and Jonathan and John and Katherine and John Van Donk the five of us are sort of the organizers of this conference and um yeah I think we'll have a limit of about 300 people that can attend Jacob thinks that's way too small Jacob thinks that's way too small so I challenge Jacob if he won't if he can put together a conference for a thousand people and in Los Angeles not way out to chino Ontario go for it go for it Jacob so mark those dates and when tickets go on sale I'll let you know I'm really excited about that upcoming conference anyway paintball for jesus that's where I was going when we played paintball in thunder bay you know you get hit you got to go back to your starting point and count to 30 so in a sense you have to respond so there's there there has to be the real risk of failure and of suffering and even of death to make the game real the difficulty I thought of when he was um when he was going through that was there's what about community because the same is true this this scales up one level up in terms of communities communities have to die um there are always people who do more suffering than others um and then you have the question of fairness CS Lewis wrestles with this and the horse and his boy um one of the now that I have the rights to use 10 minutes of each of the exodus series I talked to Jordan about that too and um now that I have the rights to use 10 minutes of each of the exodus series there's a really nice place where Dennis Prager goes into theodicy and I have to have to find that and that'll be a video that comes out sometime soon hopefully I hope to dig in more consistently to the exodus series they also record the second of the thing doesn't just do like the second half of exodus they sort of ran through a lot of the rest of the pentateuch and it sounds like the next series after kind of the finishing of the Torah or the pentateuch is going to be David so it looks like they're going episodic which is probably a good idea because if they were going to go through Leviticus and numbers and Deuteronomy at the pace they went through Genesis and Exodus I don't know if Jordan would ever get out of the Old Testament and into the Gospels which I very much would like to see him do be really curious to see what he obviously he'll be attracted to the book of Revelation very curious to know what he would do with the with the apostle Paul anyway but what about a community of edges because this Jordan is so sort of focusing on the individual and this really scales up to community and what that means is that well people live horribly brutal short lives and that's not uncommon and whole nations do so and whole nations suffer so I really liked where he got going in terms of the theodicy but he certainly left some meat on the bone for more thinking and more work on it and so I'm sure that's I've Delegated a little subcommittee in my consciousness congress to continue sort of mulling on that one as as we go further. Competence of course came up again part of what came through and the friend that I went there with afterwards noted it too in one of the question and answer someone asked the question Jordan how did you how did you become who you are right now and he talked about when he was about 13 years old which is the same age that he mentioned when he left church also told a really wild dream and the question and answer but when he's about 13 years old he read his first sort of serious book he was in seventh grade read his first serious book on the holocaust and that sort of lodged in him and he's never stopped looking at tyranny and suffering and the holocaust and and you know what the way I what I take from that is it gave him that's right that's right CW my consciousness congress is presbyterian that should not surprise you my consciousness congress is presbyterian that should not surprise you um jesus revolution next month where was I going with this see that's why I can't read the comments because I distract myself okay reading about the holocaust at a very early age shaped in jordan and augustinian anthropology now that's those are fancy theology words but a a an understanding of the of what jesus says when jesus says he doesn't entrust himself to men because he knows their hearts but always with an augustinian anthropology you have to balance that with a imago de an image of god anthropology they're always intention those two so my friend commented you know it's it's really rather strange that jordan can in some ways insult an enduring audience because in this culture where there's so much pelagian anthropology um people love to hear you know you're doing great you're wonderful you're a being of light you're the dust of the stars you're yada yada yada all this happy clappy talk and jordan comes in and said you know talks about snakes um and you are the snake he said he had some good riffs this was his best speech that i've heard live and and one of the best that i've heard him make although that and i probably should give it some treatment as as rick noted um and and turn your kids into snake handlers and then he talked about um he talked about a number of things but part of what so we talked about you know if don't let your basically your frame of cognition come into your life and you know you're not going to be able to do anything about it let your basically your frame of cognition i won't go into that it's it's a point that he's made in a number of different places but part of where i go for my own one of the videos that i almost made yesterday i didn't really get to it in the video i did make yesterday was i want to look at the nine dot problem a big tension in this little corner and when i say tension i say it as a positive thing part of what makes john vervecki so much fun to talk to for me is that we have some significant differences and that and this is what i really liked about the the jordan the jordan daniel wood john vervecki conversation that i commented on this morning is that we're having people have really productive conversations with people with dogmatic confessional religious differences because this is fun but it's only fun if you can figure out how to do it well and i understand that the old atheist theist debates on youtube were a certain kind of fun but that was sort of a junk food fun because you get your thrill dunking on the other guy and pwning the other guy and owning the other guy and all that kind of stuff in terms of jordan peterson want to play iterative games this is way more fun because you know when john vervecki and i have disagreements or even jonathan peugeot and i have disagreements although i guess jonathan peugeot is colonizing me to an increasing level because our disagreements are diminishing um it's fun to do it again and again and again because we're doing it in such a way that it's not just a matter of me swatting down his good points or the audience seeing me swatted down by his good points or the audience seeing him swatted down by my good points it's when he makes a good point i have to live with it i have to struggle it becomes opponent processing for me and once that gets into my presbyterian consciousness congress hopefully out of that time a new answer will emerge and that then john will have to contend with and what we actually do in terms of that opponent processing in terms of that deal logos is we level up that's a far funner game than owning the atheists or whoever your political or religious opponent is this is far more fun because we actually both get stronger in the way and hopefully with that opponent processing as we get stronger we get closer to the truth and closer to maturity and close to the ideal and closer to the telos and i think you know thinking about sam's i should really i should really just post sam's sam i'm sure will get me permission post sam's conversation about evolution because part of i know evolution is a contentious thing but but this is the point even for and against evolution we should let those conversations continue i always like reading it sounds crazy i like reading the intelligent designers and the young earth creationists i like reading them because they force me to level up because when you take an easy answer the downside of dogma is that you begin to rest on it and all of our models are insufficient and god wants us further up and further in and so he gives us opponents and if we can create an arena by which we and the opponents cannot just sort of take cheap points from each other but actually work with each other we will both grow and that's the whole idea behind dia logos so i think that even from a view from below in strictly secular terms the development of the of a rich afterlife in continuity with this world was fundamental for the development of much of the good light that we have arrived at and the loss of an afterlife the loss of our imagination into the afterlife will actually in the long term hinder us and so of course you know part of the the difference between john and myself is this question of a two worlds mythology and you know this has been a difference right from the start i think that actually anticipating union with christ and the resurrection is fundamental for and i'm going to use the nine dot problem to explain why maybe i'll make that video today i don't know hopefully i'll make it at some point but that's what i want to work on and so i think you know jordan makes this point about basically they're making existentialist points about meaning is valuable enough if it's enjoyed in the moment and what i think is that without the enlarged frame that affords current imaginal participation in the afterlife we get truncated i think i think that's why in many many cultures and religions afterlife is sort of an essential aspect and secularism wanted to cut it off but i think that truncation is actually a very serious problem now i'm getting thirsty did i bring my water bottle i did hang on this is the downside of not bringing anybody in it's just usually i can just pause the video and get my drink yeah anselman great point ken ham has given a platform for serious scientists to present evidence for the creation account of the bible that's part of the reason you need opposition again it's opponent processing so and this was why do we go see these things live that was my thought there that wasn't in there jordan mentioned eve as meaning he gets this from ben chapiro benevolent adversary i think benevolent adversary riffs on the um in genesis in genesis to what was rendered in the king james bible has helped me it's not really the because in eve she's the mother of all things i mean the the the meaning of eve is given in the text itself you don't have to sort of put help made in it but that's just some of my um my my biblical word accounting the goal in chess and again he made the same point if if you're the kind of another interesting thing about jordan's shame and honor cultures are are pretty are very much there in jordan's value ecology you know if you're a if you're a grown adult and you love nothing better than to play uh third graders that chess because you can beat them all the time you're not much of an adult made that point optimized development um talked about parenting and this was really good he said you know every every everyone is sort of 40 crazy but if you marry and bind yourself to another your um your 40 and their 40 won't overlap and when it comes to parenting what you're doing in the marriage is that opponent processing and you're optimizing for parenting and for raising that child which is a real reason why parents should stay together marriage might be hard it might not be what you were hoping for but for the sake of the children keep working on it try to get it better marriage has opponent processing i thought that was really good um opponent processing in the world he told he told the story of his of the biker neighbor that he had when he was a a grad student in montreal told a told a uh you know a story about him going to biker bars with him he had told that story before and and then he told this really great dream about basically this this um this scare the staircase made up of the wood of the pews of the church he grew up in and i asked him i said do you remember a lot of your dreams so i don't do now but back and this this made total sense to me back when he was studying yung and studying dream interpretation with young and sfreud then of course he remembered his dreams because his dreams were salient to him and i think part of the reason we in the west now at least in the weird world don't remember our dreams is that we think they're unimportant when i worked with the haitian pull out your bingo cards dominican republic there it is when i worked with the haitians the haitians were often telling me their dreams they had huge importance in their dreams and i was talking to um niqama and and jesse and jacob and or no it was joseph and the hama and jacob was it jacob with jacob in there i don't remember who um but but i asked about in israel and and they said this this surprised me because israel israel's such an anomaly um i i'm fascinated by i'm fascinated by the jews in this corner why are the jews so fascinating they're such interesting people so um oh i said the jews and dave chapelle said never say it that way but they they talked about i asked i said are dreams i mean the dreams are critical in the bible you're always got these dreams and the hama said yes they are people pay a lot of attention to their dreams among the israelis and i thought well that's fascinating because israel is both an extremely can be an extremely secular place and also a deeply religious place and so after like i mentioned after i got home i was i was wide awake and full of adrenaline so jacob was just chatting so i jumped on with jacob and richard and um and jesse jumped on there and so if you're curious about that you can find that on jacob's um federechi channel um you can see what we talked about there because i talked about the event there too because i was i was just full of it so the spiral staircase with the wooden with the wood of the spiral staircase made up of the of the pews of the church that he grew up in wow let's see you don't mature until there's someone more important than you yeah it's true it's it's usually starts out as a spouse and then often becomes a kid um you know until you until you have a kid i always say that to people you know i i didn't think i was selfish until i got married and then my benevolent opponent in many different ways taught me how selfish i was and then i thought i had learned something about maturity until i had had a kid and that those kids are brutal teachers about just how selfish you are because they don't care if you're short on sleep they don't care about anything they just have needs and you're it to meet those needs and if you're smart and diligent and fortunate to have two parents for one kid um then you share it and then you have and if you're blessed enough to have two kids well then kids well then suddenly it's you're you're each you know you're it's both of you have one and then if you have three kids you're outnumbered and then after three it's just you just spend you're just going to spend a decade or more just working for those kids and you do if you're a good parent you lay down your life for them it's cruciform it's sacrificial it's christ-like and you know and that matures you and grows you up you know i i think if you look in the new testament where paul is laying out in in in timothy and titus these um qualifications for being for leadership in the church uh husband of one wife that's read lots of different ways sometimes it's read in terms of monogamy but i think also and i don't think this should be a rule because i've seen some of the best deacons i've had deacons and elders i've ever known have been single but usually single people who have suffered and and so there's if you if you're actually by now i'm going to say something that shouldn't be controversial if you're actually following a christian sexual ethic of only sleeping with someone you're married to that's going to grow you up because you're going to suffer enough in singleness you're going to suffer enough with um with chastity and purity probably failing it often but if you if you make that your ideal and you pursue it you're going to suffer enough to mature and if you marry you're going to oh you're going to get sex hopefully not always there's a lot of sexless marriages but if you marry you're going to suffer in your marriage and if you have kids you're going to suffer for your children and all of that suffering will grow you up that's again that's the opponent processing and it makes us mature and i do believe that part of what this world for is and many religions have aspects of this in them but part of what this life is for is preparation for the next and so all of this maturing and this growing up and this suffering this is to prepare what christ has for us in the new heavens and the new earth how will that be i have no idea we have no idea we have no idea i don't think by virtue of how we are formed in this world we can adequately relate it which is almost exactly what the apostle paul says but just with joe my 17 month is making suffering a lot yeah married 21 years daughter 18 wife and daughter grew me up good there you go freedom's lunch you're exactly right you're exactly right um you do not mature until you're you are willing to sacrifice yourself for another and of course he said he didn't say it directly but he intimated it you know what what on earth does that tell you and what does that tell you in terms of a religion yeah it it tells you a lot talks about kings and prophets prophets i mean he's made that point before it's a good point back to opponent processing theodicy holy grail he was going to close at one point and he got riffing on another thing and yeah if you if you're going to be jordan peterson's manager you're going to have to be flexible because if he gets a new idea and he goes off on another arc he's going to go off on another arc just when you thought he was going to land the plane he talked about social contagions like cutting and bulimia and anorexia and in freud's day hysteria and talked about why he went and testified to the ontario parliament because he knew that monkeying with the pronouns is going to cause a lot of problems with teenagers especially teenage girls and that this was a bad idea and you know the thing is i've heard a number of people when jordan first started talking about some of this stuff in the academy people are like man he's a little shrill yeah we understand the point yeah we understand the problem five years later they're saying things like no he was right he was right telling the truth as an adventure and again that's sort of bundled into into faith um and he said some things that were basically you know don't you know part of telling the truth is saying something when you have to say now again the tick tock of this on one hand that's true there are sins of omission if you keep silent on the other hand i know plenty of people when is your next one on one with jordan i don't know i i thought i thought actually um i probably should have asked i probably should have i was going to tell tammy because i thought it'd be her schedule might be a little bit easier that she could come on my channel if she wanted to but i don't i don't want to i'm very i don't want to take from them they've they've given me so much so i i feel very indebted to them so i'm not going to i'm not going to ask them to come on my channel at least not at this point unless i and i you know i know some of you are like well why don't you should ask because i actually chad chied my wife for these kinds of things often to be more bold and i just made a comment about it but at the same time i also believe that when it'll happen when the timing is right i have a strong sense of providence so um yeah i don't know when i'll see jordan again but we'll we'll definitely meet again you know he's he's the dude is so crazy busy and then he's i mean you can just to just to see all the people he's having conversations with um you know i i really don't want to to bother him or waste his time but um and and what what i can work from from what he puts on youtube is um is uh you know gives me plenty to work on so two dollars wasted shoot it would have been a better story if you had wasted 100 cw um foolish transfer oh i can't read the i can't read the comments you guys are just too funny so truth has adventure um and and my thought my thought of this was um again on one hand i mean there's opponent processing and wisdom all the time and that's why in the book of proverbs you'll find seemingly contradictory proverbs and at one point in the book of proverbs they're placed right next to each other two proverbs that seem to say exactly the opposite thing that's opponent processing so on one hand don't hold your tongue if you've got something to say on the other hand the book of james who can control the tongue um and if you keep silent people will think you're smarter most of the time the more we talk the more we reveal how ignorant dumb and foolish we are and i should be the chief of sinners on that account because who's talked more in the internet internet than i have so there we are faith in whatever happens again this gets into you know confidence that confidence that god is good and god is a good god is the maker of this world despite all of the despite all of the ways that we fear it isn't because of all of the suffering and the fact that we can't finally resolve the problem of evil and theodicy but having faith that god will make things right and do what's right i think that's that's so at the heart of the christian faith what happens when you tell the truth that that maybe in that moment the best doesn't happen to you and again he talked about what he talked about with mckayla in his video about the college of psychology that when you're in really deep the truth is your only hope the truth is your only hope because that's going to be the only orientation you have and if you lose touch with the truth you'll you'll be lost a lot of what i think about when i think about these hard questions like the theodicy and questions about truth and meaningfulness and expedience and all of these things part of our difficulty is that again consciousness consciousness is so monofocal it's really hard for us to keep all of these things and put them together which again i think is why narrative and story are so important because you can hold more truth in a narrative than you can in a list of rules or laws or proverbs i'll have to i'll have to pull out this great section on story from paul johnson's history of the jews um habit um decision speaking words in and decisions create habitable order again he's riffing on genesis one um talked about socrates had some hilarious so question and answer first thing about dating and ai had some really insightful things to say about that he said you know the problem with when ai really gets going in terms of the dating world already someone is has a freemium model for having a an ai companion and so you can have you can do ai dating for free but then if you want sex talk with the robot you gotta pay and he talked about the the um part that pornography played in the rise of the internet and he talked about the fact that pornography on the internet is is in many ways having sex with robots and i had never thought of it that way and yeah that's genius he's right you know we're thinking you know sex with robots with like you know if when when someone you can see this in the movie ai which was you know spielberg made quite a while ago but you know that you know there's going to be sex robots all over the place and peterson's point was you know that's already happening because basically to riff on jesus on the sermon on the mount um in a sense you're already having sex with robots if the majority of your sex life is with pornography boy bang powerful a powerful idea it's going to be hard he says it's going to be hard to people pull it to pull away from to pull people away from the robots i think that's right i think and and that's already happening and it's happening when and i participated this when you go into a room and you you know all you see in that room is everybody just doom scrolling on tiktok or instagram or you know it's going to be hard to pull people away from the robots just like it's hard to pull them away from their cell phones now what else we got here um oh amazing question about fear of dying from an er nurse and this person said i'm very familiar with dying i see it all the time and i'm terrified by it and he he he recommended soccer the two different versions of socrates apology and he basically said one of the best antidotes to fear of dying is really living and he talked about when how did this story go exactly someone asked either he asked his parents someone asked his parents if he's mentioned this before again a lot of this stuff you can find in other videos and that he said in other venues his parents were in his their 60s or so which is probably jordan and my age now if you could um the twilight zone riffed on this way back in the day too if you could keep all the wisdom that you have accumulated and be put back into an 18 year old body would you do it and jordan noted they didn't say yes right away and they didn't say no right away and he kind of walked walked through his own process of that because you know would you have kids again and and so i'm i'm about jordan's age and so i thought of i thought of that and it's like i i i love my kids i can't wait for grandkids having grandkids is sort of like having kids light um you get to enjoy the children but you don't have all the dirty work you get some of the dirty work but not all of the dirty work i've been watching yellowstone and um in the first season um dutton is you know that there's there's some attention paid to how he's a different grandfather than he was a father because didn't look like it was a very good father um that's an interesting show but so and then of course for me that makes me think about the resurrection but again the resurrection isn't just a new body that won't decay it's a new body in a new world and again one of the themes that that i think really comes out in the gospels is that jesus pushes this world to its limits and what jesus says is that the kingdom of heaven pushes this world to its limits but in order for the kingdom of heaven to be fully realized there needs to be a more there needs to be a new arena for our resurrected agents and you know at some point i think john and i are going to talk about this because i i think that's fundamental even for having a good life in this life it's one of the videos that's rolling around in my head that i haven't had a chance to make and that's why i stopped taking notes so um yeah it was great 1923 was interesting yeah yeah 1883 was really good um a lot going on all right uh let's see let me get rid of this this little thing and um let me do this and i'm gonna drop it here oops no work and i'm gonna go over here and and i'm going to pin this ah look at me i'm learning stream yard jacob tried to talk me into this thing so yeah descent has vultures i can only take so many of you in the room so if you want to come in and ask a question oh richards outside hey richard oh how are you good how are you i'm doing well just uh walking around campus right now all right well i saw you last night and i see you this morning i know yeah you you you are inspiring me to take notes because i almost never take notes with like anything i don't know i think there's there's risk just jumping on this live stream that shows a boldness it does so good for you yeah no but that i i appreciate you know so thanks for sharing sharing all right all right well enjoy enjoy the beautiful weather of southern california i know it's not it's not hard to take is it no you know it did get colder down here than i saw it but not for too long yeah weather up here is gorgeous right now oh we got another denizen denizen of this little corner oh i i hope i wasn't too insulting grim you know i love you no you're koftick i had no idea that's what that was about sometimes i mean there's other ones but that's one of them oh richard seemed to have froze we had a what was the topic of the may conference was a question in the chat i couldn't answer the um the topic of the may conference was um the quest for a spiritual home oh yes hey sam hey grim grim also didn't you uh like meet with them afterwards and gonna tell us about that part well what do you want to know i mean i i did meet with them and um what i guess one thing i can say is you know i got a chance to do some talking and and then the friend that i brought in really wanted to share something and jordan i hadn't been in a room with this so jordan went into therapist mode and it was really cool and i really got the sense that i he had to have been just an outstanding therapist um i i was i was really impressed how well does he know you like when you are talking to each other how familiar personal is that i don't know that he knows me very well i think he has a sense of what i'm doing i think he trusts me because he knows that i'm working pretty closely with jonathan and john you're not just a lying pastor no i'm not just a lying pastor um and he i vindoch's gonna be upset because i didn't talk about estuary so he knows that i'm working with john and jonathan and i think that gives me a little bit of credibility with him so but you know how if once you have a sense of just how doggone busy he is and keeps himself you know it's pretty tough so so when are you going on the big show whenever i'm asked they didn't tell you to like scrape me off like barnacle or anything did they scrape you off what no grizz no grizz i want i want to i want to point as many people to your channel as i can i i take it as a personal failure that you're not up over a thousand yet yeah i still think that'll kill the channel we're doing a deadwood intensive on the discord saturday night and i guess cassidy is streaming after this so i won't be streaming today folks because i'm gonna i'm gonna let cassidy have the spot let's go over there all right well hopefully you know jacob's jacob's um new thing is going to bring some coordination to this little corner of the internet and jacob chastised me last night because he said you know vendonk's doing this thing for like 300 people it should be in la for a thousand people and i said jacob do you really think he said i could get a thousand people just for you and that doesn't make it worth going to la oh i think we lost vendonk i'll bring you back in john when you're when you're uh when you seem to be connected again so anyway so yeah that was that was last night and um oh you richard richard i'm not going to participate something happens to you your mother's going to eat me alive i'll talk to you when you're done driving no streaming and driving no streaming and driving i won't permit it i like how your video actually made it seem like i contributed to that conversation you did contribute to that conversation vendonk you gotta you get it if you're gonna be in here vendonk you gotta you gotta have a good connection and and so anyway so no i um why do you think um the new testament um uh may or condemns or says that peter was off track for wanting to build tents what was peter wanting to do and why is it dismissed as he didn't know what he was saying or that sort of thing like so many things in that story and many other stories in the new testament um i think there are a lot of layers to it i think on one level so in luke so i put all three passages in luke peter sees them walking away and wants to build shelters so that could lead to some motivation on peter's part um that and and i think just even symbolically he wants to he wants to tie them down do you think he wants to build like a do you think it's he's trying he's wanting to build a shrine which might be considered idolatrous could be i would think he'd want to build a shrine because that's sort of a reflexive thing to do for a greco pagan or a greco roman person at that time i saw a god i'm gonna build a shrine and we'll remember the time that we saw the gods and we'll do one to all three of them even jacobs um even jacobs comment about the ascension that basically the ascension undermines the resurrection when in john you know the rationale for this jesus says i need to go so that the spirit can come and he will do what i can't do and so there's there's there's very much a hierarchy thing going there where god's spirit needs to come in at a different level that even jesus who seems to be able to get around pretty easily walking on water and such um even jesus can't accomplish this and so the spirit must come that seems pretty clear what jesus wants to say in the gospel of john i don't i don't know if you saw on twitter sam that esther had a or bethel had a comment that she basically thinks that even non-trinitarians are more christian than people who um who permit same-sex marriage in church well i can't imagine why she was thinking that i actually had a conversation with her two days ago it's rendering through the tubes as we speak um so but that how nice of her to say that yeah i thought oh that's that's that's yeah that she has elevated sexual ethics above the nicing creed in terms of well what do you got coming up on your channel sam you got any ideas or plans or guests coming i'm talking with jordan daniel wood um in a couple weeks as a follow-up uh to that conversation so we'll get more into the nitty gritty of maximus and his christology and his effects on the history of christology and what i agree with that and what i don't and that sort of thing um jordan wood he is a difficult person to understand and like for veki has his own vocabulary world that a certain theological universe understands and speaks in but is hard to translate outside of that i feel like and nate is especially plugged into this world there's i don't know like john bear roan williams the former archbishop of canterbury um david bentley hart and jordan daniel wood are sort of like they would cluster together if you were to do like a twitter you know universe uh algorithm right that you i don't know what european neo neo patristic orthodoxy i don't you know something like that um and and they they have this they have their insider vocabulary which is a little bit tough to penetrate sometimes and so i'm i'm wondering how i'll be able to talk with jordan daniel wood and try and make them make more sense to more people because i feel like that's one of my missions when i'm talking with verveki is to is i dumbed down my vocabulary not because john can't understand me but to make him more understandable to other people right and so i'm wondering if i can wrangle jordan wood in a slightly similar way well oh now the vendonk finally got his act together so i so nate sent me an email introduction with with jordan daniel wood too and i you know nate nate's working hard to bring jordan into this little corner so i don't know how many jordans we're gonna have at the end of this but um here's jordan vendonk oh no it's john vendonk what what do you have to say john i you don't pop into these things well i can tell you is that i hear a lot of repeating the sub yeah do you hear an echo i hear an echo and now it's oh it's better um turn off turn off um youtube right because if you have youtube open and the stream yard open then you'll hear yourself in delay and that's very confusing turn off youtube yes but keep stream yard open it's amazing john's in this little corner at all no i figured it out thank you thanks and i swear that we were not making fun of estuary no the estuary protocol very much not very much so an interesting data point we have our chicago meetup on tuesday and i've been specifically i advertised december and january and uh february 2 as discussion sessions for the exodus series of jordan peterson right because previously you would have seen chicagoland bridges of meaning meetup and it's like one the world's that right and if i'm a new person scrolling through meetup.com that doesn't mean anything to me so i like you know with pictures and descriptions was like we're discussing jordan peterson's exodus series right and three newbies showed up out of the woodwork on tuesday and we hadn't had very many newbies in quite a long time so we probably had more newbies on tuesday than we had had over like the course of the past year um and so it was an interesting data point and we did go around and introduce ourselves until a little bit of our background but we didn't do the what do you want to talk about because we're talking about the exodus series did you watch brandon's brandon's video have had something to do with that um brandon's video i mean brandon was there so we were teasing brandon for uh making fun or no actually i thought brandon we were like brandon you were very fair and you were very measured in everything that you said but just so you know we were watching so brandon anyway um uh we did we so we the meetup starts at seven but we also offered you can show up at 6 30 and we'll watch half an hour of it and so it was optional whether you could show up at 6 30 and watch a half hour together or show up at seven just for the discussion is it going to be a running half hour or a selective half hour um a running half hour basically the the apparently that i actually haven't watched very much of the exodus series i still i'm still not paying daily wire anything um and so i only get clips and stuff coming at me so uh we're just going through the first episode so far but i i bet that in a lot of the early episodes a lot of the talking heads sort of have their built-up wisdom that they bring into it and i wouldn't be surprised if it exhausts itself after a little bit i don't know how you feel about that paul if you've watched more than i have i've i've watched i i need to get into the later episodes i think part of the strength of it is that they have and and jordan actually mentioned this last night they've spent a fair amount of time together sort of as friends and so they know each other well and so they are getting some of that dynamic of of intimacy and relationship going between them and so we'll see now what they did what it sounds like they did i thought they were just going to do the second half of exodus it went right through deuteronomy that maybe even into joshua so um i so i was a little disappointed with that because i would really like because i asked him i said are you going to do leviticus he says well we kind of went right through and everybody sort of had their favorite points that they sort of hit and and i totally understand doing that because the bible is long and there's a lot of weeds in leviticus numbers deuteronomy there's some high narrative points but there's and i really wanted to see them sort of dig into leviticus and a lot of the do some rich talk about some of the ritual stuff and yes that would be interesting you know some of those priestly rituals you know it's one of those things like you read this and if you don't know what you're reading it's like what in the world how many times do i need to be told how many goats and rams and bulls need to be killed for this and that but if you dig into it what does it mean why did they do the atonement first before they go you know there's a lot of stuff and especially peggio would be incredibly good at sort of bringing that out yeah no i agree so i really wanted that stuff so maybe well gosh i wish i had 40 hours in a day instead of 24 because that would be you know we've got quite a few resources in this little corner where we could play with some of those things too and so yeah yeah but he jordan seltzer said something interesting he said numbers is the beginning of statistics and i thought what so i'm i'm i'm very much looking forward to the next series but i've got to do my due diligence and work my way through this first series i think some of those new meri at sumerian tax accountants are wanting to take credit for that but all those little clay uh they look like bird pecks on them so so why did you jump into the stream john you just want to be a part of it or you got some got anything to say about this thing we're doing in may yes so in keeping with the topic of leviticus and the liturgical and repetitive practices i am now ready to announce that paintball for jesus will officially be on the schedule for the may 18 through 21 conference in southern california you heard it here first all right there you go even though i said it a little earlier in this live stream what that the paintball will be part of it yes i did see i show up late as usual but but have you made any mention of the fact that we are going to be eating pizza afterward at graziano's no i had no i had no knowledge of that yeah you heard you had a little meat heavy cookout in thunder bay after paintball in the rain so i think um pizza sounds like are we driving it'll be on thursday the the paintball place is actually closed on fridays and so my original plan for doing that on friday morning is not going to happen so paintball will be on thursday people that want to participate in it will have to fly in a little bit early everyone else will get started on friday morning which will give us a little bit more time for the real for the meaty stuff okay well it looks like i'm driving because rick says are we driving i'm dying to do a road trip so how many people are coming to this we are what's your sense of attendance we we are hoping for uh roughly 300 people 300 yeah we're planning for 300 and do they have to buy admission tickets how what's the what's the price structure like oh it'll be uh that's actually the the tricky point that right now that i'm still uh kind of trying to work out the details of but we have a budget and we have put the budget together based on somewhere around 250 average yeah for ticket interesting and then you have to add the transportation and the hotel all that stuff but uh yeah but that that people are handling their own lodging and transportation well we have some suggestions we have some suggestions for what they uh for lodging wise but yeah you didn't block hotel rooms or even i did yes i did you did block hotel yeah i did yeah but they are a little bit they're a little bit um out of the way so right now the one logistical aspect that we're still trying to work out is how are we going to get people from the airport to the hotel to the venue to the paintball back to the hotel to the restaurant to the you know and to the bar at night yeah how you doing shane i say muted i'm i'm doing great um i have a question that i don't i hope isn't coming completely off track here but partly because of the recent um verveki videos that he's been releasing um this this um this idea of um how we see what we see being informed by the way we see the world like the the the eyeglasses we're looking through the the functions that we so um a friend of mine uh has been working through uh challenges trying to help people understand his his spiritual worldview and i think that that is something that is a challenge for all of these sort of estuary situations where we're using these different languages right like i heard the the verveki wood conversation and i was loving it because i was just allowing all the terms to remain in sort of the abstract domain and so i was just riding the wave loving every bit of it but um the the i'd like you paul if you can to if you can relate this uh genesis 3 6 where eve sees the tree what does she see and like what does it mean is it even the word see there like in your interpretation because the serpent convinces her in a certain way and and so when we're trying to describe hey this is not good for food to somebody who's in an estuary uh environment and and i don't i don't mean to like own like i know what good food is in that sort of metaphorical sense of what is good in life and what is bad but there's something that john's doing currently in his um uh this this new series that he's doing that seems to be really grabbing uh getting a good hold of this need for us to identify uh purpose like meaningful purpose with what we're doing and so so where can you just can you try to connect that scripture with the the sort of error that we're prone to as we as we try to identify in our salience hierarchy our relevance realization process what is good and what is not good how how did in in the first page of the bible where did we go off track so good question i've been so this week sermon is on the body of the sermon on the mount which is really difficult i haven't quite figured out how exactly i'm going to do it because there's basically the beatitudes that i dealt with last week in my sermon and then the body and then the ending the body's a major thing and i'm using um righteousness i'm trying to look through i'm i'm trying they can't wait for this in the air um just you're illustrating seeing there um so i'm working on right i'm working on the body of the sermon on the mount through the lens of righteousness and seeing and now i'm seeing beautiful children jesus begins chapter six be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them that whole segment where you have these three dominant forms of jewish piety and the main focus of all of that is to be seen and even the practice um be careful i gotta rework my logo so that the grief comes up automatically um that it's synced um you know the it's it's practicing your righteousness and now righteousness is sort of an a thing you can't see and and so that's actually an incredibly that very much gets at your question shane because you're right in that she looks at the fruit and it's good for eating i mean in a sense there's always a lot of discussion with the fall when does the fall actually happen does it happen in the eating of the fruit does it happen in the seeing of the fruit does it happen in the wanting of the fruit does it happen in the rebellion that that wanting elicits so that's a great question and and when you know when we look at say peterson and peugeot's conversation about attention about strongly relating attention to worship and and all of this talk of the cognitive science in terms of you know consciousness is is there's a lot that goes into what we see i think there's a lot there and i don't have um anything ready made to sort of deliver to you on that but i was hoping you might have um or be able to sort of give a little of your attention to any distinction there might be in the in the term um whether it is being properly interpreted because we know that there's at least in the way that we currently process the term seeing it's a little bit different than knowing and clearly it's different than knowing after they've known uh the fruit and so what is it that like how did she come to see it the way that she came to like i don't know that it's even knowable right in that text there's so little there yes it seems like there's something critical there that can perhaps allow us to see um something beyond um or or evaluate different elements of what it is that we're looking at so that we can see it for more than or more accurately i don't know thank you if you can give any more to that yeah it's part of there's always this difficulty with the whole language question of reading in a translation because obviously what goes into the english lexical range of seeing will not be identical to the hebrew or the greek and so people people often think that oh if if some knowledge of the original language will resolve it sometimes yes sometimes no because even let's say biblical hebrew that we have the which the how much of a corpus how much insight can we get into the lexical range for a word when really most of what we have is just within this one book so so then we look at the other uses of that word in this book to try to get a sense of the globalized sense of the word but even that's a small window with koine greek we have a little more advantage in that there's a much bigger greek corpus out there but once you're looking at a language over a span of centuries you then get other signal to noise issues with that kind of lexicography so i don't know that getting into the um the lexical range of the word will necessarily help you and i think it's you're probably going to find more help either in symbolic resonance or or theological well even if we think you're right that there's something there to look for even if we abandon the sort of the term like you know whatever i maybe there's no more to work from if we look into the words like the thing that interests me is was it was it was there any element of it that was accurate and correct like was it good for food like are the things that she is saying about the tree and its fruit are they true in any sense is was the fall or is it is it now on one hand i mean that's the question and and fiat people have been debating this for as long as we've had the story because you know if you follow the jordan peterson line will we get self-consciousness and and peugeot has this very interesting probably got from church fathers where maybe the problem with the fall is that it came too early and maybe if we had delayed gratification a little longer there would be less uh drama and destruction and corruption due to it but you know oh happy fall is a is a theme that comes through again and again in different things because it's in some ways our collapse it's it's like when chad the alcoholic talks about his alcoholism that on one hand you know it's a it's a it's a huge curse and it's a huge problem on the other hand would he have found christ and redemption and all of these other goods if it had not been for alcohol you know and it's shakespeare it's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all so you're knocking on some pretty important doors there shane it's real it's real i'm not the only one in this in this little group before that has wisdom so if anybody else has something they want to add to it i had the audacity to express my opinion about that in a recent thread on voices about um eastern avenue and uh and i said something to the effect that um eastern avenue is one of the progressive churches of the christian reformed church that's pushing on the discussion on the discussion about um what are the tools at our disposal to resolve the the conflict brewing within the church about um same-sex marriage and being affirming or more traditional and um there were there were people who were saying that if we would only you know go all the way back to the confessions the confessional statements that would that would help out and then there are others that said well we have to go back to our hermeneutics of the scripture you know that that would that would help out and then i had the audacity to say that um we we don't even have agreement on the meaning of words like belief or even the word agreement and and i was thinking and i was thinking about jordan peterson and the way he deflects many questions about his religious convictions um by saying that depends on what you mean by belief yeah and and and i was kind of blown away by the fact that nobody picked up on that yeah that that fell on completely deaf ears that may be an automatic uh reflex precipitated by my perpetual making fun of phrasians but uh maybe i've lost some credibility there yeah you know you can't if you swing a cat in the christian form church you're probably going to hit a phrasian so you didn't come over with the canonical wave of of jew of he of uh dutch refugees phrasian refugees to found this church so uh but voices you know voices is voices has become this corner adjacent in some ways but of course most of the regular posters on voices aren't really except for richard i mean richards become a very regular poster on voices so yeah anyway joe hey so are you i'm good how are you i'm good good i haven't got a chance to watch that conversation you had with the exorcist it was a good kind of scared me a smidge bit but it was good to have yeah it's good to have um we were you know actually uh father vince he touched on this a little bit we indirectly talked actually about what i think shane and we just dropped off was was discussing about you know was there this aspect of good to the fall yeah and it does that actually is a scary thought also because it makes you reframe this this story that you feel somewhat comfortable with um and i know peugeot in in a way has well worked on obviously this question too it's like well you know the fall allows us to come into greater community with one another um it allows for things like well communities to even be created cities and he's done a lot of work on the on the you know the symbology of what a city is and you know even things like as you pointed out self-consciousness um clothing right warmth comfort like all these things are a result of the fall and then yeah you do have to then you know reflect on this question and then well all of these things clothing cities community relationships marital great clothes i mean i don't know but it one reading that in which maybe you can take it is that obviously because of the fall adam and eve had to come together in greater marital union and you think okay well then if this is the structure of things well these things can't be bad in nature right i mean so a greater marital union can't just because the genesis the genesis of a great of a marital union can't be bad in nature and so these can't i don't these can't just operate on just like that dualistic good or bad right back spectrum so yeah i i feel uncomfortable talking about this because again like the the the fall is a story i felt somewhat comfortable with but when you reframe it like that you begin to question all these things so yeah and i and i got to the conversation like so i don't know exactly what shane was trying to get at but that's just my two cents he was getting at the seeing aspect of it um jess in the jess in the um in the comments is is you know probably pulling his hair out about the u-shaped journey because that is of course the u-shaped journey that jess has done a tremendous amount of work on and um jove and so it's there's yeah there's it's amazing that after um thousands of years of theology we're nowhere clear we're nowhere near done i know it is it is wild when you i mean it really it's a wild concept and i don't really know i mean are there any who's working right i mean do you know anyone who's currently working on this particular project um are there lenn vanderzee what is it john lenn vanderzee on on what particular project just the nature of the nature of the fall yeah the nature of the fall nature and extent of the fall i'll grab a little alliance see if i can get him to join here okay that would be hilarious what is he is he publishing currently on this uh depends on what you mean by publishing um it sounds like he's active at least so um that link what is the easiest way to get that link to him in an email paul do that well it's you'd have to cut and paste it i pinned it to the top of the stream on youtube which you probably closed instead of muted your your you know the one thing i like about you john is you're bold i mean you try stuff that i don't know if you're going to be able to pull off getting len on a stream yard link how much longer is this thing gonna last i that's another thing because i don't know how much longer i've got i've been going at it now for a couple hours and so we're gonna unless we get a whole bunch of new blood in here i'm gonna land the plane soon yeah i was gonna say you've been going on for this has been a filibuster all right you've been on for a long time uh well we'll let it we'll let it go but i just did drop them a line i had no idea how what the what the what the protocol for these things is as you well know i i know very little protocol my procedural knowledge is uh minimal of what happens in in this little corner of the internet yeah yeah and and it's and it would be i think hard for len len len can sort of do a zoom thing but to have him drop into this conversation i think would be difficult but i but now you said he's is he actually working on a book i didn't know that oh i don't know about a book necessarily but he's always thinking about the nature and extent of the fall i mean i've heard him say that many times yeah yeah yeah all it's and and part of you know evolution sort of you know alternate alternate creation narratives especially the scientific evolution one of course has sort of kicked that off and len pokes at that fairly often on voices right and and i think i think that's something that we actually need to do a lot more thinking about um oh aaron would love to join the chat but i've unfortunately only just dropped in so no aaron come on in if you want to hey paul do you know of harrow harrow and schneider are anywhere in anybody's radar to uh to continue their initial conversation about this the guys that wrote in the banner about the uh the um this is some years ago already about the implications of of the um scientific analysis of the of the the genome the same guys that lost their job at calvin exactly those two guys yes i'm sure they're around um yeah i mean wouldn't it be nice to engage them somehow um i i think so my difficulty with a lot of book and paper scholars is that you know especially if they sort of lean left once you say jordan peterson they all sort of you know they all sort of don't want to get anywhere near jordan peterson because well quit saying jordan peterson then i don't seem to be oh boy we got this this whole thing really got off the ground so all right you said something about fresh blood and there's jacob well well you know that right now cassidy was supposed to be uh live streaming and nora is live streaming and you're just stepping on everyone's toes paul hi erin i'm sorry no wait now i was on a work call so i really didn't get to hear well i was on a work call and i had you kind of in the background so they probably my work call probably heard some of your voice but how did this what was the um catalyst for this exact question though like how did this come up i had the same question jane asked about in genesis three when eave sees the fruit and sees that it's good for eating oh gabby this is the gabby so gabby bumped into me last night at the event and she came up and said i'm the one who asked you if you're coming to this and at that point i wasn't but then i did and so i met gabby there so great to see you gabby so genesis three and and then when shane asked that this a lot of what's going on in this little corner is about seeing yeah and and i had never thought about i mean it's it's just the bible i mean the old testament often has a bunch of these ways of talking which i mean robert alter was really helpful in sort of opening that up and not seeing it the sort of bad redaction which was the way that a lot of critical scholars in the west sort of dismissed a lot of it but you know there's a big point made in genesis three where she sees that the fruit is good and okay well what does that mean so that was shane's question and that's where we got into you know was the then was the fall good or bad and in in fact even you know when i as someone from the reform tradition talk about the fall that's a major piece of our narrative arc you know jess's u-shape but that text doesn't operate in that same way in all of the communities that read the bible so yeah this i have a very specific question about that all right i'm gonna i'm gonna drop myself out here y'all keep talking and behave yourself don't get me struck out of youtube jacob don't say anything bad about lighting fires on other people's buildings that's all i have to say so keep going john well my question actually is jacob and you can help when it says that eve sees the fruit and sees that it is good can you flip that around and say it was revealed to her that it was good based on the grammar tov mar eh interesting yeah it was it well i mean i i have to say like i think the jewish understanding of the whole fall is just so different i have a difficult i have difficulty like this word homoartyology like is has been incredibly interesting to me and i think it's interesting to me because the ways christians look at sin um like the idea that looking at some like seeing something is itself a sin is like yeah there is a concept of like there are things you should not look at but like yeah but can we see anything at all that is not being revealed to us no of course not you can only see that which god uh shows you that's my point yeah like one one thing that i'm reminded of but this is obviously way later but it's the the the neoplatonic sense of you know uh for instance like if you see beauty you can only see beauty if you participate yourself in the beauty which in this sense would imply right you could only like see sinfulness uh at the moment you participate in it yourself but obviously like that's mixing up traditions that are thousands of years apart but the notion could be similar right that it's anticipating that sense it's a particular kind of seeing right like just like a kind of seeing when you're uh for instance uh yeah i don't know looking uh with desire toward someone while you're trying to be faithful to your partner you know in that same sense but i'm not sure if that's unrelated in this example well i mean well even even there even there in a in a kind of a weird way you can only see the object of your desire when the object shows up right sure i don't want to get too catholic about this but uh um i was just so this is interesting um i i don't know how familiar and i don't know actually all my feelings about this to begin with but um i just read again pope john paul's the second theology of the body and that notion of seen within like the intentionality of seeing um is a big well it plays a heavy part i guess in that theology of the body um because i don't know jacob you were talking about it you were saying um well essentially you were it sounded like you were touching on like in the christian tradition uh maybe like cross in a cross christian sense that yes to a degree um sin is in relationship to seeing right i think that's what you were is that what you were saying um that you were that the christian tradition compared to the jewish tradition's notion of sin is is off or is different because of that aspect well i i know paul loves dot doug wilson and there was a debate there was a debate that doug wilson was having with someone else about sin and they got into really fine particulars about when precisely do you begin to sin when is it yeah yeah and and i mean it just seemed so incredibly legalistic to me sure that i was i was like because the question is like as erin was saying okay if you like the a really easy example of this is yes i'm with my wife and a very attractive woman walks down the street now is it a sin if you know is it a sin if i look for a second or is it a sin if i you know the moment i key in on a body part is it a sin if i just notice her in general i if i'm aware of her presence and that that presence obviously you can't even like differentiate like the nanosecond of when like lust becomes into that into that thought so yeah like exactly yes um and i mean i can't be able to cite it but i i do know um i mean what is and how did you get there in the first place it well yeah and how did she get there in the first place and it's funny you say that because um that was another thing that's heavily addressed in theology of the body if you know and i don't want to like again i don't want to make it too catholic but um you know this idea of you know how did she get here in the first place is it a sin to even you know is it a sin to dress immodestly or is it you know or is it really only a sin because you're having other people pay attention to you right i didn't i didn't actually even mean how she presents herself i didn't mean that what i meant was how is it that at this particular moment this particular attractive woman appears in my peripheral view yeah i mean how is it that that even happened the the comments i left on that video was god does not expect you to write a phd dissertation on the nature of your sin when you pray and honestly that's that's what this type of hair splitting like i'm sorry but like when you sound like a legalistic Pharisee to me you're here you've gone too far i thought i sounded like a Calvinist myself but not much difference no i mean that doesn't mean i mean i don't i don't necessarily disagree with you Jacob but then again Jacob was the guy who can also connect other things that many of us don't look like they relate but Jacob finds a connection there so uh hair splitting um look not only for those with hair on top of their heads hair splitting look i love a good Talmudic pill pool like i was thinking about this like there's there are these methods where you like you you go very very fine into the nature of sin and like i highly recommend Maimonides laws of repentance to everyone um it's it's beautiful and frankly many many many pious Jews memorize the the entire 10 chapters of it and it's in a sense legalistic yeah it is because he goes into very fine detail about when you have to apologize and and things like that at the same time like this whole concept of homartyology like that word itself just bothers me yeah but there's obviously going to be like a legalism with it because of the fact that i mean in both traditions right i mean if you just look at the basic commandments i mean what is that i mean it is a legal document so it is obviously going to inherently be like a legalistic pursuit i'm going to agree with Anselman in in three words that he said sin is serious sin is serious it is incredibly important to know what sin is but when you're sitting there and you're you're asking yourself did i sin in the fact that i inadvertently saw someone like i remember when i was in yeshiva my parents came to visit me and they took me to a lot and here i am a yeshiva student wearing the clothes of a yeshiva student on the beach in a lot and there are topless women all over the place and it was like i started running like i did i was i was like what am i doing here right um at at the same time like your your that that sort of hair splitting or it's it's it's just not useful yeah it's it's a sin yeah it's a sin for me to look at women in a lustful manner like that's a sin but sitting there and wondering if the fact that um i saw that woman at all topless is a sin or not i think it misses the point i think it might help to to to frame this conversation in a slightly different context and there is a um a bit of a debate again going on on voices when two parties split and there is animosity there what are the possibilities and the likelihood of there being any kind of reconciliation or any kind of graceful separation or any kind and so i introduced into that conversation the idea of a of a divorce and so what what does it take for two people who get a divorce to coexist or to raise their children together or to be able to show up at at various um holidays or festivities you know at the same time with their with their former spouse and and that actually is another way of of being able to assess the the depth of transgression or the depth of hostility or the depth of violation that that has occurred between these two parties and then to to find a way to navigate that somehow by perhaps not talking about that um it's infringement or not talking about that and so and so and so if you if you're going to be very legalistic about it then you can say well so-and-so cannot show up at this party you know because he did this that and that and that it's really interesting to me that you bring up divorce because i think divorce is actually like this is this is one of the things jesus says um this is not how it was from the beginning and i think christians don't understand the halakhic context of saying this is not how something should be right so in in jewish law we have this concept of something that is ab initio and something that is ex post facto right you're you in in a perfect situation divorce is absolutely unthinkable right no one should ever get a divorce ever except the fact is that the law provides for divorce and so when and i have to say this is this is one of my big faults with christianity is christianity i i think does not handle well this idea that yes we are fallen people and god gave us divorce because he always recognized that and yeah i i don't i mean you see that christian denominations are very bad at dealing with divorce and i think jesus was completely right when he said look at phila in the beginning right from a beginning point of view and because of the hardness of our hearts god gave us divorce and like i'm getting on my soapbox which i know paul loves me saying more about bad with divorce like what do you mean by christianity is bad with divorce like look at it look look at how catholics deal with divorce look at how the crc deals with divorce look at how divorce is being dealt with in christian churches it it is dealt with very poorly i would say how do you know about how the crc deals with divorce i've talked to people who have been divorced in the crc paul um when you say like the ease of it jacob the ease of in which um like you can take a step to get a divorce and create like i guess the the accessibility of it or is that what you mean or is it more like the how do we handle the family after this is like the counseling aspect of it or all all of it look in in in i'm not saying certainly jews like the orthodox jewish community is not people with perfect people at all i've been through some horrible divorces in in the orthodox community uh but when it comes down to it i this idea of whether or not you give communion to somebody who um who has been divorced like the catholic church is still dealing with that at a very like and the idea of annulments and the again yeah but the reason why i brought it up jacob is not so much to talk about how various denominations deal with the actuality of divorce namely the breakdown of marriage but rather when there is a breakdown when there is a relational breakdown such as even the way cs louis talks about the great divorce namely the divorce between god and human and humankind that divorce so my my point is that that that there is there are two attitudes that you can take towards that probably a lot more but at least two and and and the one is to say you know it's a done deal and we're going to continually refine our fault finding and make sure that we know that you know this party is at fault or that party is at fault or it was the laws that thou gave us me that were at fault or it was the fruit that thou gave us me that was at fault or alternatively figure out a way or observe the way either figure out or observe the way that we can coexist in spite of the great divorce and and the coexisting with god in spite of the great divorce there is stuff to be known and observe and appreciate about that and and emulate and follow and and try to practice and there's also the alternative thing and that is to continue to to separate and distance from one another and point finger and and blame and and and perpetuate the animosity but and i think that in some ways i think that it is the the legalism that arises out of of um well let me just leave it there these two things are very interrelated if you're good at being able to deal with divorce in the family context then you should be able to deal with divorce in a denominational and community context and if you can't deal with it in so it's you can't split these it's it's a similar skill of toleration and forgiveness and understanding the context of what does it mean for us to live in a fallen world and again i think the problem is theologically christianity has problems dealing with all of this stuff i i just see it as a theological problem that underlies a lot of different problems but how would you say that is different in the jewish community that a discernible noticeable difference between these two communities in terms of dealing with the fall it goes back to jesus it goes back to jesus it goes back to what jesus was saying when he said in the beginning that is not how it that is not how it was meant to be but because of the hardness of your hearts god gave you gave the law of moses of divorce are you saying he was wrong are you saying he was wrong i'm saying he was i'm saying christians completely don't understand it i'm saying christians do not understand what jesus as a rabbi was saying which every single rabbi for the past 2000 years has been saying similar things about divorce and christians don't have the vocabulary to understand what jesus was saying well uh erin and cara came in here and i want to give them a chance i believe jacob came in here to admonish us to close down the stream and he continued to lengthen it for 20 minutes cara was live streaming and you were you were interrupting her i'm sorry cara it's okay we finished we we managed to go two hours of live stream of owning up to our feelings and needs and like actually the whole chapter was on uh it's not what others are saying if you feel something in response it's on you you have to be able to be mindful of that it's like i i want to address the idea of the possibility of divorce it's actually uh i see i see it as as two possibilities so there is hell and paradise and let's say uh future life together would be this paradise and divorce would be this hell the possibility of hell is actually gives people options right uh so people can be in this marriage and they can sin a lot a lot and then they go to hell which is divorce basically so they get separate their uh dreams are ruined and it's a choice it's like the the fact that we have in marriage like if it's if it's it has to be just marriage like no possibility of divorce it's like it has to be just paradise no possibility of hell like it it needs to be there as like a counterweight as far as i'm concerned like it's just like my thought at this point and uh also to the point how not to see an enemy or like not to go through this emotional and negotiate those kind of kids and stuff during the divorce like see your partner as a human being don't see it as an enemy as like do that didn't work out so let's let's deal with it in the best possible situation and actually have seen uh separations like that happening where people were like painfully admitting to themselves that it's like actually really bad together it would be better apart and they would go through that and end up friends still like and all of those situations like kids and houses everything was handled in the most polite manner and people found better happiness as well so like i don't know there is no one recipe for everybody one recipe for everybody like it's everything different individual like but the most important is like just respect uh people in front of you i like that notion of the the checks and balance the heaven and hell the checks and balance if you kind of need the the idea that hell exists in order to stay grounded in the you know in the actual marriage i think that's interesting and jacob i'm doing a lot of thinking now about catholicism and divorce and because obviously in you will you talk specifically about how many people that are divorced are taking communion um and tons i mean that's anecdotally i don't know but i'm going to say tons and the difficulty with that is because it is so parish to parish heavy it's well it's not even parish to parish it's priest to priest right and i don't know i don't know how this functions on a protestant level because obviously with the grave sin of divorce and with the sacramental reality in catholicism right we're actually i mean we're believing that we're taking christ in and that's the very difficult thing with why i think catholics and the catholic church has been so as you put and i i sincerely agree as a catholic who is married i sincerely agree with how at ease the church is almost at at the nature of divorce of the idea of getting a divorce and it's like because we because we participate in this in this sacramental reality every sunday and we're literally taking in i mean obviously right as the catholics believe i'm literally taking in the body of christ at one point it's like how can i deny anyone that ever no matter what they do right i mean how can i even if they i mean a divorce is a grave sin but how can i deny the individual the actual body of jesus christ and i don't know again i can't speak for the protestants but i know for in catholicism that's a big part of it it's like how do we i mean because then again it's like well what is the nature of sin and because we you can't out sin god right so if you can't out sin god's grace but you've got a divorce how can i deny someone community how can i deny someone literally digesting both spiritually and physically the body of christ that's the hard thing for the catholics i don't know how to answer that but i know on a catholic perspective i think that's where the struggle lies it's interesting like i'm not so much into um i don't have like a denominational expertise so i can't speak to that but um it's interesting jacob like that you tie this to that theological notion because to me it sounds much more like it's sort of part of the general trend of what's been observed of how we have um it was also i think in the conversation between douglas murray and what was it again tom holland and then get this other individual for the hoover institute and they brought up this sort of chirardian distinction between sort of christianity on the one on the one hand and hyper christianity on the other hand that's short if you have this strange split in our society where some christian values are sort of used against it and that's like some people call that sort of anti-christian values and that is sort of the concern the the concern for victims actually some actually being sort of this power dynamic and that's a problem you sometimes see in these divorce as well right because what happens in a divorce is you have a bunch of victims right so you have parents and you have children and everyone is a victim so like we're concerned for all the victims and we're like let's just you know start all over again so and that's also why obviously like this whole peterson thing is so interesting because he is like you know going in from the other perspective like oh we need to take responsibility and you know these parents should take responsibility and stay together but in my opinion it's much more related to that part right like that we're considering everyone to be victims so therefore obviously you should get divorced if you feel unhappy because you're a victim and you know the world is going against you and you know you should do whatever you like i think it's much more related to that part than those specific words of christ that you touch but again it's not my expertise but that's my feeling on this matter jacob i'm also thinking about now man that was it was a good point because i'm also thinking about this i mean why in you know it's a sacrament right marriage is a sacrament and again if we're looked at who's the ancestors of marriage i mean i brought this up with with just paul and john uh it's well it's adam and eve right and to say what's the worst thing that happened to adam and eve okay well right they they fell right and but then what did they do they they hunkered down and they came closer together right and they they came in together even more we don't know that we do not know what the nature and the and the nature of the connection between adam and eve was prior to the to default the word the word that is used in the hebrew when it says that god uh basically kicked them out of the garden is garach it says he divorced them the great divorce interval my point was going to be inter i mean so this was my but this is the point it's like if they hunkered down then um i mean it goes to show you i mean jacob from what you're getting at your main point is you know the ease i mean people get divorces for i mean i'd be so curious to see what the you know what box one checks on the divorce paper um but if you know i was going to say like if we're to go back to our ancestral roots of our spiritual ancestral roots of these things right i mean what could really actually what what could truly cause someone to divorce and to break that sacrament um but you you did kind of just you know throw curveball on me by giving me the the true definition or the true translation of of the word there is a way in which there is a way in which the way people handle actual divorces could become um sort of a lesson of sorts and there is a way that you can kind of observe the way people act around conflict and the way they resolve conflict and what actual reconciliation looks like in the real world that could become somewhat of a paradigm for for how other people and how larger organizations could resolve conflict and we we we easily default i hear jacob talking about it as a theological problem we easily default in the way we understand the way you know the way this has been theologically discussed in the past but there's also a phenomenological aspect to it and that is that people have people have found themselves in conflicts throughout history and people have learned to resolve certain conflicts and live with certain conflicts in better ways and worse ways i mean that that some some people are better at it than other people are and so there's got to be some kind of a phenomenological analysis that you could do and say well what does it take to survive and to some degree even thrive after a conflict one even even a conflict as big as divorce one thing one thing paul once pointed out a while back and i i just thought it was brilliant uh was that maybe the reason we are focusing on gay marriage and lbgbtq whatever plus plus issues is because what we really want to talk about is all the problems in heterosexuality that we don't talk about uh and that was that was incredibly insightful i think it's absolutely true that all of the reason so many heterosexuals are spending so much time talking about gay marriage is because of all the issues in their own marriages uh i never heard heterosexuals talk about gay marriage oh you you don't live in the united states oh okay okay that's important oh in poland it's not a thing it's just like no absolutely not like i actually know exactly in poland it's like it's very clear yes i have a very sad story about it in the united states it's it's a huge it's it's a constant hot hot topic and i think paul i think paul has a point that it it is a hot topic because that we're not actually talking about all the problems with pornography and polygamy and and uh what what do they call it uh not polygamy um yeah polyamory the new name for polygamy and serial monogamy which is what almost everybody partakes in in right now and like there's a fundamental problem with with dealing with sexuality and so i mean the the crc synod thing from last year the people who were like oh well why are we why are we suddenly pointing fingers at at the homosexuals uh i think they definitely had a point that really like it was like okay why is this now the huge issue when we know pornography is just rampant in a in our society yeah well it's because they're i mean i like to think that the reason why these things are not getting brought up is because it would be too difficult to bring up things that you're currently struggling with yourself so we hide and hide and hide and we don't want to talk about for example pornography or we don't want to talk about our maybe desires or our thoughts i'm cheating on our wives right because we don't want to bring this to the forefront because we in fact are doing it now i know my wife's not watching this but if she was i'm not doing it don't worry but uh but uh but um you don't know but to get to your point um no it's because we are doing this as a culture happy i made paul laugh yeah we are doing this as a culture and we're too petrified to unearth quite frankly these sins that we are currently committing because if we realize that we are i mean if we unearth these things it's just gonna it's gonna throw us through an existential loop but no i mean i truly believe that the reason why these things are not being brought to the forefront is because public consensus is or not public consensus is because these are just what this is just the habits these are the habitual habits that we're taking part okay i i have to do this and i'm very sorry but i just have to what part of that comes from the christian idea that if you are a christian and you accept that jesus into your heart you no longer sing oh i don't believe that at all and there are very few christians who do believe that are you sure about that yes very few christians well like a lot of christians if you accept that atheists in the west are christians but it depends on what you mean because right like that that's the point i was also trying to make earlier it's like okay obviously it's indwelled in our culture and now it's being sort of taken over by people who don't actually commit to the religion but i would say that the very few christians in that sense like that actually like are committed to religious lifestyle yeah i see what you're trying to add jake i have heard left and right oh if you know if you accept jesus into your heart he will defeat sin for you sure like like theologically speaking jacob i think you're talking about the distinction between how we see ourselves and each other and the way god sees us i had no idea i just laugh anytime a christian tells a gay person that if you accept jesus into your heart you will no longer be gay you're also and that very particular denomination of christianity though like i would quite seriously speak on all catholics and saying that i don't think that i don't think any catholic would agree with that statement or any statement okay i have to say yes i am definitely talking about protestants but specific i don't even i mean i don't know about paul or john but i don't think that you would even agree with that would you no paul i know that there are christians who um who certainly say these kinds of things let's see one is certainly beckett cook well i mean it's people are all over the freaking map on this and clean merit clean narratives don't exist so if you look at beckett cook he's about his hardline protestant as you can find on this matter and you know you can look at rosaria butterfield you can find all sorts of people who are um all over the place with this stuff so i'm not going to speak for them beckett cook and rosaria butterfield say once jesus came into their heart butterfield say once jesus came into their heart they are a new creation that's what they say it's not my place to say they're not the majority of same sex the majority of same sex attracted christians that i know populate the rest of the spectrum but they're on a spectrum i'm sorry this is this is the ultimate christian claim of jesus died for your sins which i find laughable well that's why you're not a christian yes so the matter definition but were you trying to get at jacob this is why people are bringing it to the forefront yeah because because if you admit if you admit that oh i have a problem with pornography then you're admitting in in that light that jesus is not in your heart that you are a failed christian that you should not be taking communion that you should be disfellowshipped and again i would go ahead that's not really the way it works in christianity because again total depravity another thing that you don't appreciate um everyone that comes to the table is a sinner and they come to the table because they are a sinner and and now that's a struggle in i was just talking one of the randall's conversations that i haven't released yet i mean there's a perpetual issue there's a perpetual tension in christianity with respect to that jordan b cooper the title of his channel you know you know basically sinner and saint at the same time martin luther that that's all about that tension and that's why in the christian reform church the fight isn't really over sexual practice it's the fight over regard with respect to sexual practice that's that's that's the way christianity works now i i know you disagree with it you're not a christian that's that's again a model definition some people say that the bears have a good football team um most of the world says they don't but i i mean given that distinction then i would still in a way kind of be interested in in hearing how jacob does his theological reflection about the presence of failure and sin in in the jewish community and and how any kind of uh forgiveness and reconciliation particularly with god might happen so um the example i've started to give is fat rabbis there's a there are a lot of fat rabbis and we all know that gluttony is a sin and we all know that the fact that they're fat is a visible manifestation that no matter how good of a person they are they lack the self-control to actually control what goes into their mouths and that doesn't change the fact that they're rabbis and we love them and they may be some of the holiest people in fact they tend to be and he's public enough that i can say this rabbi breitowitz is one of the most saintly people i have ever met in my whole life i love that man like you wouldn't believe and he's overweight and anybody anybody in the jewish community who brings up the fact that he's overweight is a tuchus i'd say jacob that christians have been working for centuries on their theology of sin with respect to practice and part of and and there have been a variety of christian uh segments that have dealt with sin on varying different levels um and i think that's a very important aspect of the segments that have dealt with sin on varying different levels um the holiness movement but the but the main the main categories remain the same and their theology is is an attempt to make some sense of these realities you know such as um you know you you often point out the um do you also also point out the ways that you see paul of tarsus fall short the ways that you see martin luther fall short the ways that you see me fall short and and christianity has done a great deal of work in thinking about sin and the christian life and um how how it is how it is how we process that and of course the drama of in the in the catholic tradition the drama of confession repentance um absolution communion i mean all of that you look at the sacramental system in the roman catholic church it's all about how on earth can and again back to and then you and i've had you know disagreements about this going back to the book of genesis how can a holy god live in the midst of an unholy people without killing them and plenty got killed in fact the whole nation gets killed in the desert in numbers because of sin and so earlier in the podcast i mean sin is should be taken very seriously why the wages of sin is death okay so we are sinners and we are called to be holy how does that process work it's a whole so much of the faith is about that and we can put it up that we can put it in in newer terms such as transformation that's what peterson and vervecky like to talk about i mean these are conversations going on again and again repeatedly under how many of our conversations and when we get to something like divorce which is divorce and marriage i mean if if there is a divorce marriage sexuality pornography i mean these are the these are the daily bread of pastoral ministry these days throw money into the mix money sex and power um and we're when we're dealing with them well okay well we've got an ideal how are we going to not only recognize the ideal bear witness to the ideal but also increasingly um participate in the ideal and pursue the ideal it's other language for what the christian religion has been working with with people for centuries it's it's something every religion has and must deal with constantly yep um i think the problem is as opposed to jesus paul of tarsus gave you a very bad theology for how to deal with it yes we we we hear you jacob we hear you i can put a little i'm learning i'm figuring out how to do these little crawls jacob thinks christianity has bad theology someone alert the new york times pauline christianity jesus jesus actually seemed to have known all about judeism yeah he's the most he had a good idea about it jesus understood judaism i i have no problem with jesus all right so okay now i i want to i really want to i i feel really bad for cassidy that we are we stepped on cara we stepped on cassidy i feel really bad about that actually because i very much want to promote you know cassidy and and cara and all of these other and joe and all of these other channels and if erin starts a channel i'll promote his too erin says no not soon enough but i i want to know i want to give everybody a chance to kind of say what they wanted to say and then we should land this plane i want to jacob's job so go ahead cara uh i i want to talk about uh the possibility of divorce um and marriage so i i do not see a possibility of divorce for myself like i just don't it's like and i have been married um like i don't know 14 years uh okay tomorrow will be will be an anniversary 13th yes so it's actually tomorrow and um yeah i have to i'll have to calculate it since is that okay so tomorrow will be 13 years of actual marriage and 14 uh like 14 years of of relationship like 14 more and i don't see it like yeah i am pretty outgoing outspoken and i have a lot of friends and yet i just cannot imagine it still so it's not an obligatory thing i still see it as possibility i don't have to go through hoops uh in order to do it it's just like signing a document in a document and so so the marriage is is the unity of two people who choose to be together and like peterson talked about tummy so we are in this boat and we roll with it even if it's hard we find a way to be together we have date nights we have playfulness and stuff so jordan actually nailed it like his advice on relationships really helped and like he did not bring it through frame of christianity although i do appreciate it and um yeah so that idea should be mutual so everything mutual two people mutually decided yes we are right for each other and we will go not obligatory because uh government said so or church said so that's there are you able to see what you just said in the light of what paul said earlier about the ideal the thing we aspire to yes so what would you say to the people that fail try again okay the failure failure is just an experience it's not you failed and then nothing no like there is a new day you failed in the past you try again you do it better next time if it's with different partner well then be it it's like the same partner doesn't want to do it but you actually learn from your mistakes it's not like you're stationary always we grow we mature our levels of let's say emotional smooth swings they they they they come down to come down this time it's like uh so i do believe there is uh like everything gets better like it is communication between people that that's my idea if people don't talk to each other that's horrible and also i wanted to ask is judgment judging others is it a scene and then which is more of a scene like like talking about the the the woman that is uh immodestly dressed like i choose to dress modestly but it's not because i want i'm afraid to be judged i just it feels like i want to be taken seriously and having having um war makeup on me would make me less uh kind of people would hear me less it would be like oh you're weaponizing your appearance in order to be heard and so like to me i i cannot weaponize my ability to scream loudest although i do believe that guys who just come into their own this is their war makeup that's the equivalent of red lipstick as far as i'm concerned it's just like i do not choose to weaponize mine i would prefer the art of conversation like a respectful argument as well thanks yeah good um yeah i i i sorry they did you want to say something more harry okay no uh yeah thank you very much like i only dropped in quite late so i i missed quite a lot of the conversation unfortunately um but what i should say like even besides theological issues happening sort of post christ like there's just a lot of what jesus himself said right like in terms of that that's what i'm really thinking about so like either indeed like of desiring this other person and like you know and that that's already sinful or indeed uh let he who is without sin throw the first stone and the point of those statements is that yes obviously you can have like one dominant theological interpretation following that and that that could be problematic but they are so ambiguous in themselves because right you can either conclude from that like oh so we're all sinners so basically then no one is a sinner because we're all the same so let's just celebrate and do whatever we want right like we don't care but indeed kind of what paul is also relating earlier and that's really i think how most christians are relating to it it's like okay wait what does that actually mean for me to be a sinner like how do i relate to my sin and actually incorporate that very carefully into ourselves so besides like all the theological issues like that happened later i also i think it's already starting in the words of jesus himself and we're dealing with it like from that moment onwards and that's sort of what i'm thinking about so that's the last statement i wanted to add but thanks this was great um i think any last word i would want to say is that i and aaron thanks for saying that because i kind of reinforced it and i was thinking about christ came so that sins can be forgiven and i really like want to focus on so that they can be forgiven right not that they're not going to necessarily happen but that they can be forgiven and i i think that that's really something important to to reflect on and to think about um with our own relationship with sin knowing that they're going to happen they're still going to happen i mean we have obviously and you know we have free will and that we are you know the fall is is true and real um but they're they have the possibility to be forgiven and we have the possibility to keep on getting up and i think that's the beautiful thing about the christian tradition in general across the nominationally is because right christ didn't come and say we're going to be like deterministic animals and we're just going to you know follow suit we're going to be just in this like weird you know it's just every we're nothing bad is ever going to happen again but yeah so it's going to be forgiven but jacob i would love to have you um and i would love to talk more about divorce and pornography and all these issues of why people are are having or why all these issues in which influences divorce can i make a can i make a selfish pitch just for two seconds um i had a conversation check out my channel carrie i'm going to check out your channel um yeah um i had a great conversation with a exorcist named vince lampert and it's been the most popular uh episode so far because i think it's like people i mean and this is so fascinating people love evil i mean if you really want people to walk into the door i mean pop a exorcist on your channel i got you're going to get thousands of views and i've been reflected on that why that is and this conversation today is even helping me reflect on that more um and it's a good conversation father vince is a very devout catholic priest so a lot of the answers are pretty straightforward and pretty catholic but i do think that even in in those more catholic straightforward answers that he gives it's a lot of food for thought so i would encourage anyone who is interested in how evil is at the roots of all things and you know how the devil places little tricks to to go watch that but jacob um i you should give my email for my channel because i would love to connect with you and have the conversation my my email is very easy to find i love listening to myself speak so um my last name at gmail is just my email and frankly you can google my name and find my cell phone number like that so don't worry about it um uh i'll write your name down i'll i'll uh i'll leave us with one of my favorite jokes so uh adulterous woman is brought to jesus and the crowd wants to stone her and jesus says let's the one who is without sin cast the first stone and the crowd starts melting away and this old woman comes with a stone and throws it at her and the rest of the crowd comes and stones the woman and jesus turns to the old woman and says mom that's not what i meant i i really thought you would write paul jacob's number 555 555 555 this is an old this is a 1980 song 8675 309 so it's not a number oh so lyrics it's song lyrics for us old timers all right um any other any other
