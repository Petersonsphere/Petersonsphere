 Hi, this is Paul and this is Rough Draft for Sunday where I run through the current status of my Sunday sermon. My Sunday sermons are now all given online on the church channel and you can find the link below of where the church channel is and so if you're curious in the final draft you can look there. Last week I just used the rough draft. I've done that twice. If I think the rough draft goes particularly well I'll use it instead of the other copy. Most of the time I don't. Most of the time after I do the rough draft there's a whole bunch of things that I wish I'd done differently and so it gives me a chance to fix it up by Sunday and then do it anew on Sunday. Now back in this chair, back at the computer since the COVID-19 virus. Last week we looked a little bit at this optical illusion and we compared it to Peter's view of the world. How the resurrection of Jesus changed Peter's view and this is a classic optical illusion and I've seen it so much I can very easily intentionally and with agency see either the young woman seeing the back, just the back of her face or kind of the profile view of the old woman with the big nose and I can just simply with a matter of focus on my aht with my eyes and with my consciousness go from one to the other, one to the other, one to the other. I have complete mastery over that right now. But there of course is this third perspective of the picture which in some ways I can't actually grasp and that is of the picture in its entirety or in a sense the picture itself. What's nice about this optical illusion is that by virtue of the fact that I see two different pictures depending on how I look at the picture, I have some awareness that I can't see the picture apart from my ability to in a sense and I don't even have the language for it to see the picture as a young woman, as an old woman or the picture as it is. That in a sense is a picture of the whole and I don't quite know how to explain it. I can't quite see the picture of the whole. Now this week on my YouTube channel I did an interview with a very interesting young man named Matt Miller. He is a prison guard in Washington State but he also has a YouTube channel where he does symbolism in Hollywood movies and I think he does really quite a good job. And he gave me a sneak peek at a video that he'll probably put out in this coming week on the movie Arrival and I saw the movie Arrival, I think I saw it twice total, a couple of years ago. He mostly does treatment of movies that have been very popular that most people have seen and in fact many people have seen more than once. In case you've never seen the movie, Arrival is about a group of alien spacecraft that come to Earth but unlike most Hollywood tropes they don't come down shooting things up or gathering people or all the usual things that we imagine aliens doing. What they do is they come and they're there with their ship and of course everybody on Earth first is freaking out and then the ships don't do anything and what's their intent. We try to mind read the aliens, we can't because we're people and they're not. And so eventually they send in the linguists and the linguists and the ones who are going to try it, well how can we communicate with this alien creature and in a sense each of the ships have what sort of looks like a movie theater in them and they try to create a language between them and here's one of the linguists in a suit with English writing on that says human and they're trying to communicate language. Can we learn each other's language so we can communicate so we can figure out our intent? Now one of the things about human language is it's diachronic. Now what do I mean by diachronic? Well actually that word diachronic comes from the Greek language. Dia means is a preposition, Greek prepositions are really important, is a preposition that means through and Kronos is one of the two Greek words for time and it basically means kind of the rolling or running time that we experience. In other words we experience language through time and that's simply that's how we experience language and then part of what's behind the movie is the idea that our consciousness and our experience of the world is shaped by our languages and if you know more than one language people often experience this that there's things that you can sort of know in one language that you can only roughly approximate in another language and this experience isn't too difficult for us. Well and we sort of experience life this way. Life is one moment to the next, one successive moment to the next and so within our culture we experience life as a very linear fashion through time and in fact all of my sentences that you're listening to now and decoding effortlessly if you understand the English languages there's one word in front of another and you sort of store up in your mind the words that I'm saying till I get to a certain point in the sentence where you understand everything that I'm doing but if I started squawking, see you expected me to say talking, but see we're always living in this moment of we've got some things revealed out but other things we're sort of waiting for and anticipating and we can't see the whole picture until the whole sentence is out so we go through time that way. Now what's interesting about these aliens is that the alien language was not diachronic and so part of what makes this movie interesting is that the movie is very confusing in a lot of places because there's a lot of these they seem like flashbacks to the woman and so here's the birth of her daughter and then the illness of her daughter and the death of her daughter and what that does to the family relations and to her marriage I mean all of these things are just kind of swirling around and we just can't make sense of it because we're used to movies telling stories diachronically through time and so what the movie begins to show is that while the aliens see things as bang just right there that's how their language works and and so what learning the language of the aliens affords this woman is a new perspective on her life. Now we see this again in language because you can't understand the letter in some ways without understanding the word and you because letters don't really have meaning you can't fully understand the word or at least what I'm trying to communicate without the sentence and you can't fully understand the sentence without the paragraph and and right now some of you are thinking where is he going in the sermon you can't fully understand the sermon until you've heard the whole sermon and then because I'm doing this on video and on YouTube you could go back and look at this sentence now but later from the perspective of the entire sermon and the sentence would be different because you've heard the whole sermon can't understand the paragraph without the book and can't fully understand the part without the whole and vice versa and so we always have this this time problem we're working with now now last week we looked at Jesus as the black swan and we talked about that Jesus and his whole life and his death and his resurrection and everything that happens after that is this surprising disruptive mega influential event in history that dramatically changes everything but we're not exactly sure how and so when we look back on it we sort of tell stories that say okay now we can make sense of it but while we were in the middle of it we didn't see it coming and and this is very true of Peter and we see Peter in the gospels and then via the tradition and via this picture from from renaissance we we have this image of Peter now as an older man being crucified upside down and how does that figure into the Peter we meet in the gospels and the Peter we meet in acts and then this this book of first Peter that we're going through now Jesus is not just a black swan Jesus is sort of like the aliens making us see the whole because here's the difficulty we have as human beings and we're experiencing right right now in the midst of this disruptive pandemic that has disrupted all of our sense making abilities we don't know how to make decisions now because before we thought we could see the whole we really couldn't but we sort of had it mapped out and and communally we sort of agreed to how it was going to how to do how it was going to go now we're sort of in the midst and we we consciously realize we don't know what the future holds and in this way Jesus resurrection is revelation because Jesus asserts that his when we see his resurrection we begin to know ourselves in the future and that should help us make decisions about what to do here and now when we see how now we see this in a number of ways first of all we see how we really are when we crucified Jesus because we thought well we were just good people well we're not very good people because here we have crucified the son of man for what crime and a number of people said hey what what what what exactly has this man done that warrants death well it doesn't matter we're just going to kill him oh okay and Jesus in fact recognizes that we don't know what we're doing on the cross he prays father forgive them for they don't know what they're doing in the crucifixion and resurrection we see past and future and together not the parts but the whole and now Peter relates this in this book of first Peter to what Christianity is therefore with minds that are alert and fully sober set your heart set your hope on the grace to be brought to you when Jesus Christ is revealed at his coming so not only do we see Jesus as sort of first fruits our future in him but Peter then locates this and says there's going to be an event in the future which is the event in the future which is sometimes called the second coming it's often called the presence when all of this stuff will come to be but we can't see it yet because we're passing through time now we started talking about this last week because in the first few in the first verses of this chapter well that's what it said blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who according to his great mercy has caused us to be born again in a living to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead so we see our resurrection in Jesus into an inheritance imperishable and undefiled and unfading reserved in heaven for you who are being protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time okay so so Peter is trying to give us this alien perspective picture on us so we're traveling through time but he's saying in the resurrection in the crucifixion and resurrection and then the revelation of Jesus that's coming in the future we have the whole picture of the world all at once now like I showed last week too even just verse 13 the verbs are yet to come and so even in this sentence because you know we talked about last week that these Greek sentences in terms of sentences that we have are very long the first thing he's setting up for the big reveal is therefore with minds that are alert and fully sober now remember that word sober because that's going to come up in a little bit set your hope on the grace to be brought to you so it's coming but I'm showing it to you but you can't fully realize it yet when Jesus Christ is revealed at his appearance at his appearance so we're still diachronic but here's the picture as obedient children do not conform to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance okay now we're looking at the past but just as he who is called called you is holy so be holy in all you do now the first thing we're going to have to talk about is this thing that I highlighted here evil desires and if you look at a variety of different translations you'll see that one of the ways that if you're if you use the English language to read the Bible if you want to get sort of a window behind the scenes compare different translations and notice when they differ now these what the NIV calls evil desires let's see the le be called them former desires is is a fairly common Greek word for this context epithumia now again remember the prepositions are important epi means over and through Mia means desire so this is an inordinate desire so as obedient children do not conform to the inordinate desires you had when you lived in ignorance before you saw the whole picture we have natural needs but basically desire we have natural needs and desires that when properly ordered are exactly as they should be we have needs for and desires for food we have desires for affection we have desires for sex we have desires for security all of those things are important but they need to be ordered and when they get out of order big problems happen now one way we can see this is if you look at let's say chimpanzees chimpanzees when they're small and infants and basically chimp toddlers they're very cute and we really like them but chimp adult chimpanzees make terrible pets and even researchers when they work with chimps keep the chimps in cages because as many of you know chimps are way stronger than we are and the thing that one of the things that separates us from the chimps is that we have a lot more inhibition now that might sign that may sound strange but actually that inhibition is the secret of our success I was reading a book that I think it was entitled the secret of our success that tried to say well who's more intelligent people or chimps and the book basically said well people aren't that much more intelligent than chimps in the ways that we look at intelligence one of the things that people have over chimps are inhibitions and that sounds strange in a sense chimps are completely epithumia if they get upset and they're your pet and they're an adult chimp they might kill you it's it's like a toddler with a temper tantrum the toddler has very little inhibition the toddler doesn't quite know how to manage their emotions and their feelings but because they're a toddler they don't do a whole lot of damage but if you have that in a chimp they can do a tremendous amount of damage and an adult chimp can quite easily kill even a very strong adult human being if just one-on-one without weapons or anything like that epithumia basically are these habits that we develop because we can't see the big picture and they destroy our lives and in fact we see that all the time now another example would be dogs dogs via our training of them can develop impressive inhibitions you can have your dog stay or heal and all of these things but in a sense you lend your inhibitions to the dog now let's get to the second part of this first now as obedient children do not conform to the these epithumias that used to destroy your life and now some of you who had dramatic conversion experiences might be very aware of this it was love of money or love of drink or love of sex or love of glory or love of beauty or security something like that was controlling your life and now when christ comes along a different highest love displaces these other loves but just as he who called you in the name of the Lord but just as he who called you is holy so you yourself should be holy but what does the word holy mean holy means set apart this song a song we find in the bible holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty that's what the angels that's what the angels saying in Isaiah six he is set apart he is different he is unlike he is above anything that can be imagined which is why in the Ten Commandments you have this commandment you shall not make a graven image of anything and associate that with God because you can't represent God by any single element within his creation even the whole of creation is insufficient to represent God he is holy holy holy now the Israelites get a lesson in this in the desert wanderings when they get a whole list of rules where you have holy things and you have common things and you have unclean things and there are all these rules of managing this and what this does for the Israelites is sort of give them a mental map about the idea of what is holy and what is common what is set apart or put aside for special use versus what is there for common use and at the center of it was this tabernacle and this tabernacle was in a sense a holiness containment unit because when things go bad God breaks out of the tabernacle and it's almost like Chernobyl because lots of people are going to die because that which should be set aside like radioactivity and like the high voltage that is in wires in the wall once it gets mixed in with common well people die and the mosaic purity laws were to teach Israel what holy means now let's put this together with the epithumias wine and drunkenness are common biblical imagery of glory which is like high voltage and holiness and our weakness to it so wine isn't itself holy but it's something that we have to handle with care because we have some epithumia weakness when it comes to alcohol and that's pretty common 10% of people struggle with being with being how can I say it with being enamored or attached in an unhealthy way to the glory of alcohol so wine is in a sense the glory of the grape and something in us abuses it and we lose our senses actually if you go a few verses before which I didn't talk about last week this word is used of in a sense how the angels get when they look at the gospel it almost makes them drunk because they can't see enough of it and the same word epithumia is used of them there so our desires become over desires and these then destroy our lives and they break down the vervege of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit ofили with respect to the things that you are only recording by asking yourself take this beat on and the only option is if you have a lot of patience need I would go to admonishes is that we become holy just as God is holy. Now we're not going to become holy, holy, holy, but that holiness begins to grow in us with respect to the things that used to trip us up. Now if you're an ancient Greek you might think about Flip Wilson and the Church of What's Happening Now. For those of you are old enough to remember Flip Wilson and the comedy sketches that were used to be on TV, one of the famous catchphrases that he had was, the devil made me do it. So the way the Greeks imagined this, the way they perceived their world was that there were these powers that would come over them. Could be Cupid shooting his arrow, Aphrodite, Mars, or spirits, you know, it could be alcohol spirits, and that they became different people when these things came upon them, when a different spirit came upon them, and you can sort of get a sense of when now the New Testament talks about the Holy Spirit, that the Holy Spirit of God now possesses us in a sense, and we become now rightly ordered, and in the book of Galatians you can hear about that in terms of the fruit of the Spirit. So be holy because I am holy, that's how verse 16 ends. Since you call on a father who judges each person impartially, live out your time as foreigners, and actually I prefer verse 17 in the LEB here, as conduct yourselves with fear during your time of temporary residence. The NIV says it this way, since you call on a father who judges each person's work impartially, live out your time as foreigners here in reverent fear. Now this fear isn't really so much like being afraid, it's much more like the fear of the Lord, and so earlier we mentioned sobriety, and this is understanding, well if you're working on wires in the wall, you'd better turn off the breaker. Why? Have some reverent fear about electricity, have some reverent fear about the dynamics that used to possess you, but now are being displaced by the work of the Holy Spirit in your life. For you know that it was not with perishable things such as gold or silver that you were redeemed, and if you remember last week we talked about imperishable, which is Christ's resurrected body, versus perishable, we hear in the age of decay, from the empty way of life handed down to you from your ancestors. So that way of life which was filled with all these epithumias was empty. What does that mean? It didn't yield anything, and if you know someone whose life is dramatically possessed by their epithumias, you know that they have a very difficult time even doing things that are difficult but yet not unseen around us, maintaining a marriage, maintaining a friendship, maintaining a job, doing all of these things that require order and one's loves in order. So you were purchased by something not perishable, and it's interesting that gold and silver are used here because gold and silver are valued because they don't, especially gold doesn't tarnish, it keeps shining bright, but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blenish or defect. Silver and gold seem perfect, but now this blood of Christ, a lamb, is more perfect still without blemish or defect. He was chosen before the creation of the world and so timeless, not diachronic, but all at once, but was revealed in these last times. Now we see it. For your sake, through him you believe in God. You've got a glimpse of the whole picture. Who raised him from the dead and glorified him, and so your faith and hope are in God. So now suddenly through Christ you see the whole thing. Now that you have purified yourselves by obeying the truth so that you have sincere love for one another, so the result of this thing is love. Okay, the result of your epithumi as being under control is love, and if you look at the diagram here with the double box around it, that's an imperative verb. Love one another deeply from the heart, from the core of who you are. Once Christ comes in, shows you the whole picture, the manifestation of this is love. For you have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable. In other words, a transformation has come in, just as we talked about last week with the Heideberg Catechism says, you are already being transformed into what will be revealed at the last day. You are already in progress towards the whole picture, but you're still going diachronous through time. For you have been born again, not with perishable seed, but of imperishable. Now again, notice the imagery of seed. It's a seed in a sense, if you watch Jonathan Peugeot videos, you'll notice that I thought his video on the seed was probably the video of videos for Jonathan Peugeot, because in a sense that's how all his symbolism works. And so there's an imperishable seed that has been sown in you that will yield a crop of imperishability. It's another way of saying what he said in the text from last week. For all people are like grass, and all their glory is like the flowers of the field. The grass withers and the flowers fall. Here in the Age of Decay, our glory is like the flower of the field. We're inconstant, we can't maintain, we break down, but now via Christ, His death and resurrection, and faith which binds us to Christ, that seed is already present in us, and it is doing its work leading towards that day where we see the whole thing. But the word of the Lord endures forever, and you'll notice in Jesus' parables, he often connects word with seed. And this is the word that was preached to you. So the preaching is what produced faith in you to give you that seed and to start this process towards this end. Now the old way of life, one of the better illustrations of this I've seen is, got it via Jordan Peterson, is Homer on the Simpsons. One day Homer is taking vodka and he's mixing it in a mayonnaise jar, and this is something I've seen alcoholics do similar to it. Milk and, milk and brandy together because their esophagus is so destroyed by the amount of alcohol that only with dairy products can they get it down. But Marge, Homer's wife warns him and says she's seen him, she's seen this movie before, she's seen the whole picture and says Homer this is a bad idea. And Homer responds to her, that's a problem for future Homer. I don't envy that guy. And of course you know what happens. In a sense what Peter is saying here is, pay attention to Marge. She sees the picture. Don't be Homer. He doesn't. In Christ we begin to see the big picture, we begin to see the whole picture, we begin to see exactly where this goes. Christ's resurrection gives you a window into the future you. And you that is holy, like God is holy, you that has a life of power and glory, the likes of which you can barely imagine now, but that imperishable seed is already sown. And what Peter is saying is, why would you waste your life on lesser things? Because that's what you used to do. And he wouldn't be saying this if we weren't always tempted and in danger of what some folks call backsliding, of going back and being Homer, of indulging in the things, the epithumias that we lose the picture, we lose the vision, we act like we've not seen what's coming. And if you're like me, you know what this means. You know what it feels like to do what you know you ought not to do. What does deliverance look like? Your true situation has been revealed to you. Your deliverance from guilt has been purchased for you. Your deliverance from death has been displayed to you. There's a typo, displayed to you, not displaced to you. You have been displaced, a certain you has been displaced by this new imperishable seed that is you. Now, in the moment, diachronistically, how will you live? What will you choose? You struggle to see the whole picture at once. You sort of are flipping behind the young and the struggling old, back and forth, back and forth. Peter is saying, live out the vision of the new creation. The one you're sort of getting your eye on, but you can't quite get it. Live out that new creation even while you struggle with the old. Use the new and the better to say no to the old and the lesser. Misery, deliverance, gratitude. This is our misery and sort of like this picture we often flip back between them. And so this movement, misery, deliverance, gratitude. See, it's dangerous to just end the sermon on an exhortation. That's what the passage is. The passage is an exhortation, but the exhortation has to be nested in the picture of a whole. As a whole, misery, deliverance, gratitude. And so your efforts are not in order to earn the new self, are not as we like thinking about causing the new self, as if this was something that you would be capable of in and of yourself, but it's of realizing the new self that is already there. And it's not a case of you or God, and it's not even you and God, it's the Holy Spirit working through you, through this process of misery, deliverance, gratitude.
