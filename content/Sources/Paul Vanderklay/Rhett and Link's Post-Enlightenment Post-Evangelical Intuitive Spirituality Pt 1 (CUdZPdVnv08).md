 Hi, this is Paul. I want to do another video on Rep and Link. Now some of you might wonder why am I picking on these guys? Well, I'm not really picking on these guys because I'm like, let's say, Esther who wrote a blog which was perhaps read by the conversation in this video that I've got up on my screen. These guys are not gonna watch a two or three hour video that I make. It's probably just not going to happen. So then why talk about these guys? Does it just get YouTube attention? Well, that's, you know, that might happen and that certainly helps but I haven't really noticed it any bump in my analytics at all. It's because of a pastor and pastors are always looking for illustrations because so often we can't see an abstract idea until it takes on flesh and Rep and Link are, I can't think of two better examples for the rise of the nuns. If you're watching on YouTube instead of listening to this on podcast, you'll notice that I've got a little chart on the screen here which basically shows the changing, it's called the America's Changing Religious Landscape and it's from the general survey data that's been going on in the United States for a very long time and it shows, you know, the rise of evangelicals to a degree at the expense of the main line that happened in the, in the late 70s, early 80s. That decline of the main line has simply continued. Catholics have decreased to a degree but a lot of their numbers have been buoyed by immigration from Latin America. Evangelicals have stayed more or less the same but again a lot of their ranks have been filled by mainliners who've been defecting from the main line and going to the evangelical tribe. And the real story in that chart are the rise of the nuns, N-O-N-E-S, or no religion indicated in the general survey. And that's where Rhett and Link come in because these two guys were deep, deep, deep into Christianity in the Bible Belt in North Carolina, raised in Christian families, went to conservative, even reformed or reformedish churches. I don't really know the churches that they went to. And so their defection, their public defection feels like betrayal or abandonment and people are responding. And in this video done in another channel, I didn't write down which channel it was, but the conversation that they're doing they, they sort of push back a little bit and complain a little bit about some of the response, the highly predictable responses that they've been getting. Now this is post-enlightenment, post-evangelical progressivism and this is something that's been happening for quite a while and it's a big subject and I want to take another stab at talking about some of the roots of it. Now in any given person you'll have a different mix of factors. The factors that I'm going to be talking about are common in the culture, but one of the things you learn as a pastor is that people are not statistics. Everybody's got their own story, everybody's got their own reasons. People generally speaking don't like to be deconstructed themselves and these guys don't. You know, when said, oh it's because you moved to LA. No, we were doing this before we moved to LA. Nobody likes to imagine that it's not our agency that is moving things, that we're somehow being moved or even manipulated by cultural trends, but we all are and we're all swimming in this river and rivers have currents and to a degree if you're strong you can buck a current. Actually the river has a lot of different sub currents and so depending on where you were born and when you were born and what you do and the factors in your life, you're going to go in a lot of different ways. So what I'm going to do is talk about a lot of the factors that are involved in the history of this and this is going to be sort of a history summation vehicle. Now there are more and more YouTubes popping up of people responding to it and most of the responses really are enormously predictable and I'm going to get into, especially at the end of this video, why they're predictable when I bring in some of the Nathan Jacob stuff again and I'm, depending on what time it is and how much time I have today, I might do a shorter, a long and longer version of this video depending on how it goes. But on Capturing Christianity YouTube channel, which is, you know, which is a poly, is an apologetics Christian channel, there's a Rhett and Link spiritual deconstruction video by Cameron Bertuzzi, who is the guy running the channel and actually I really enjoyed listening to this video because I didn't know any of the participants and I'm the pastor, I like hearing people's stories and they begin by telling each of their stories. But this video was very much as Rhett and Link had imagined it would be and as we get into the terminology later, this video is for the most part a modernistic apologetic response to their deconstruction and now these guys are nice, they're not trying to strawman anybody, yada yada yada, but actually one of the best takeaways of the video for me was right at the beginning when Braxton Hunter, the bald guy in the lower, in the lower, my dyslexia is that right hand is left hand depending on which way you're looking and which way, I don't know, but in one of the bald guy in the lower corner says, you know, he and his kids would sit down and watch the show and this was just kind of a couple of youth pastors and that's exactly what Rhett and Link were, they were sort of youth pastors on a big stage at Campus Crusade for Christ. If you're going to listen to their videos, by all means listen to all four because in some ways the first two videos were more informative than the second two videos. The second two videos were again as a pastor, fairly standard treatment of, now this word deconstruction is rather a funny one, I'm not going to really go into it, but again I think a transformation as my last major video that I put out talks about that these guys have undergone a transformation of sorts and I have heard these kinds of stories for a very long time. I've heard them from peers, I've heard them from pastors, I've heard them especially from a generation beneath me, my kids are now in their 20s, I've heard them from 30-somethings and 40-somethings. I pastor a church that if all of the children of the children and grandchildren of the people that still sit in these seats went to this church, the church would be more than full. Most of those children and grandchildren don't go to any church, some of them still identify as Christians, they would be considered nuns, they identify as Christians but they don't go to church, others would be nuns, they don't necessarily identify as Christians and so this is a big, big thing going on in the church and it's for this reason that that Rhett and Link got so much attention because well they just walked in to become everybody's favorite illustration. Now I want to do a little survey of church history and the history that I think is important behind not only the meaning crisis but the nuns and the duns and the Jordan Peterson, let's call it the Jordan Peterson revival or the Jordan Peterson phenomenon. I think Owen Barfield and I brought him into a variety of videos in the past, Owen Barfield is an important person. Now I had had a conversation with Mark Vernon who's the author of this book, you can find those videos in my video channel and I'm going to adapt Owen Barfield a little bit because I think his ideas and I often, those of you who follow quite closely the people that I refer to sometimes say well you're kind of taking liberties, well I'll probably take some liberties with Owen Barfield too in this but in some ways his ideas of original participation, a divided world and then final participation in many ways are a relationship between what today people call spiritual, that thing that moves us and material. Now nuns are very spiritual, it's again Nathan Jacobs trots out a lot of the statistics in that most nuns believe in ghosts, believe in the supernatural, and they're a little on the fence in terms of God but they they like to, many like to consider themselves spiritual but not religious on and on. Now Owen Barfield of course quite famously said well pointed out well why do we have this one word in Greek and Hebrew ruach or panuma for wind and in English we have wind and spirit and these ideas have split and from here Owen Barfield has this idea of original participation where in ancient peoples they were one thing and then it comes apart and sort of stays apart. Now what I see when I understand his ideas is that these polarities are almost always in flux and if you go back to the time when I was treating some of his work a little bit in a little bit more in-depth way you can see these tensions in the gospel. For example when Jesus makes the claim it's not what you put into your mouth that makes you unclean but what's in your heart and comes out of your mouth now we're getting into some of the this polarity and it goes back and forth okay so it doesn't really follow strictly a timeline and in fact what happens often as we'll see in the Protestant Reformation is sometimes it's the gap seems to be broadening and in fact what's broadening it is actually what's putting what an attempt to try and bring it back together and I'll illustrate this in the Protestant Reformation as I go through that. So it's I would say it's the relationship between the most real and the actual. Maybe that's a good way to differentiate them because and if you again look at John Vervecky's work this is sort of the two worlds mythology we have the world down below here the age of decay and we have the heavens which are not in decay and timeless and and you have this polarity in the Greeks you have this polarity in many religions you have this polarity in Christianity so there's a lot of this going on and I think Barfield nicely sort of gets a handle on it with his ideas of participation it's always in flux. Now you see this in what's in the medieval church in the you know right before the Reformation in some of the ways and claims that the medieval world was was making we'll use the medieval Roman Catholic Church because I know that history better than the Orthodox Church. The keys the church holds the keys to the kingdom and what that means for example is the pope the head of the church has the power to release merits the merits of the saints to Christians in exchange for indulgences let's say this is of course it was one of the big controversies that that prompt the Reformation but but the the conceptualization behind that is that the pope of the church in Rome in many ways sits between heaven and earth and brokers those powers and those powers are brokered you know at it in the Eucharist all right and I had very interesting conversations with with Brett Sekold and I will I will be talking to him again Lord Willing in March which I'm looking forward to because I thought the conversation went great and I thought he and I could you know probably do a good job as conversation partner so I hope to have him on the show again and hopefully semi-regularly we'll see so so so the idea is that okay so if you're excommunicated communicated by the pope you're going to hell and this is an interpretation of obviously the Roman Catholic Church ties this to Matthew 18 when Jesus gives Peter the keys to the kingdom what is bound on earth will be bound in heaven what is loosed on earth will be loosed in heaven because the pope sits in the in the in the chair of Peter as it were since he inherits by apostolic succession the authority of Peter the pope has the power to bind and loosen what is bound on earth will be bound in heaven what is loosed on earth will be loosed in heaven two to the degree that that Henry has to go to the pope and basically plead forgiveness and to have the pope let him back in the church now we I think in our culture tend to think of these things rather mechanistically I'm not sure even medieval persons conceptualized things in exactly the same way we do but you see this power at work and and it's the in the operations of the church heaven and earth is being dispensed there is no separation between church and the kingdom of god there is no separation between the church and the will of god okay so it's it's it's very tight participation this is my body the bread is and again refer to my conversation with Brett Suckold what do we mean by this is my body what is that that we hold and of course there's a whole lot of theology and talk back and forth that's the sacrament is in a sense the the exchange between the two worlds just like the dollar dollars are immaterial things dollars are representations and expressions of debt and agreement and you know on a on a very there are dollars in my bank and the bank doesn't have a cubby hole full of these things that I draw out and I say I want my dollars not the one out of your drawer don't you have to go to the vault and pull my dollars out this is not a dollar this is a sacrament to a dollar okay and and in many ways what we're talking about is the how close is this let's say to the dollars in my dollars in the bank if I go to the ATM and I get out a 20 is that just any 20 or is that my 20 what exactly is a dollar in what world does a dollar live what is the difference between that world and this dollar okay so this is this is sort of the participation and and divorce from participation and then final participation that that we're talking about in this and and there are stories of so peasants would go in and well that's the body of christ and this is the the remaking of heaven and earth so peasants would steal eucharist wafers and feed them to their sick livestock and there's all sorts of stories about eucharist miracles because well here's the body of christ you'd better get it out there and and and have at it now this was the very stuff that the protestant reformation was objecting to does the pope have the ability to grant indulgences to those who make large financial contributions to the church does the pope have the right to sell ecclesiastical offices and and and what happens when the papacy itself seems up for sale so martin luther and many others had been seeing the had been seeing the corruption in the church and we're very much we're very much protesting it part of this gets up and again a while ago i had recommended the book fatal fatal discord which goes through the story of erasmus and luther and it's a terrific story because well here's the question does the bible contain the word of god does the bible point to the word of god sort of sacramentally is the bible the word of god or you can take the neo-orthodox is the bible the record of god speaking and you know the the church has been working with these kinds of ideas all the time does the church create the bible or does but do scripture create the church these are the issues at heart and so when erasmus finds that jerome had maybe not had the best had the best manuscripts of the bible or hadn't done the best job of translating it or maybe jerome had a different idea of what scripture is and what scripture is for and erasmus starts laying out the greek against the vulgate and writing notes about how it differs and certain of these passages are true in terms of the doctrine does the church get to write the bible or does the bible rewrite and reform the church these are all the issues involved in the protest and reformation these are all the issues that are at heart in terms of this question of participation and so whereas the roman catholic church would say the church on the ground with the pope in his cathedral is the church luther starts bringing ideas such as an invisible church there's a separation between the will of the church and the will of god there's a separation between the church and its fallibility and the and the and and the always right actions and will of god can the church get things wrong luther says that the true church is invisible made up throughout the centuries and that this was an idea that that rome very much protested against and and the more luther got into a conflict with rome the further and further these two went from each other in many ways and as i've spoken about in other videos before what happens with luther then when you when you sort of have you begin to have this separation the psychologizing as it were faith becomes quite psychological relational rather than mechanical material people who were deeply protestant wouldn't be smuggling out the bread and the juice to feed it to their livestock especially when you get all the way over to the swinglian side well it's symbol isn't even the right word it's it's sort of a you know it's just sort of a mental reminder and again go back to my conversation that i had with um with brett about his here's the book about his is really fine book transubstantiation where he tries to dig into what the reformers were trying to do but again in terms of this video what you see is this this separation and and in a sense what luther says is the dollars i'm getting from your church are counterfeit the real dollars are relationally between me and god now luther didn't play that all the way out to the end that sort of gets played out in terms of the the radical reformation and the anabaptist movement now john calvin comes along a a generation later and and continues to work on this and i've talked about before roman catholic roman catholic medieval roman catholic conceptualization along with many other conceptual religious conceptualizations that had a very much the effect of a two-world mythology you had a two-speed religion and they correlated that the monks were the religious the religio and down here is the seculum so then you could find this in buddhism so secular people go about their day job and monks spend all their time praying and meditating and so there's sort of two-speed religion and so when martin luther before the reformation obviously he's studying to be his lawyer his father is a is a newly wealthy man from mining and he wants his son to be a lawyer so the family can increase in wealth and continue to flourish materially luther is traveling through the traveling through the woods at night and a thunderstorm and he he's scared for his life and like many people he believes that the world is going to end soon so he falls down on his face and he cries out to saint and to save him and he pledges to be a monk because if you're a monk you're just that much higher to heaven and even in a tradition like my own these kinds of ideas remain pastor you're much more holy than i am your prayers will will if you pray for something that's going to get the kinds of effects much better than lowly old me who's a sinner now that's a very complicated argument but there's some remnants of these of this division this barfieldian separation okay not the participation the separation but now as i said these these things are always going back and forth and so instead of imagining that you have by the by the end of the middle ages in the early modern period the secular city and the holy church and holy ground and you know that's why cemeteries were in churchyards because it was in sacred space well well now you're going to try to make the whole city holy and and the way to understand john calvin and the kinds of things that he tried to do in geneva was that you you know people leave the monastery and you try to make the family into the little church and you try to make the neighborhood into the little church and you try to make the city into the little church and and this this idea carries forth of course into in through the pilgrims and the puritans to the american frontier in massachusetts where the the pilgrims are trying very much to set up the kingdom of god on earth and the and the puritans tried to do so in new haven i had a conversation with somebody from new haven looking to the history of new haven connecticut they would design their cities to to to become to to in a sense become the little temple below as the little temple above whereas before just the church or just the monastery with just the the clergy not the laity so you see the attempt towards one speed religion so even as luther sort of increases the separation calvin and one speedness tries to bring back participation in one form or another and so whereas before it was the clergy that are behind the screen and the priests and the monks who are behind the screen celebrating the eucharist regularly and those in the town might have it once a year after confession until they get really cleaned up and ready to go well now suddenly in protestantism at least different protestant forms the fence comes down and the entire congregation celebrates the eucharist together so you have all of these dynamics happening theologically in terms of church practice and and so you see again back and forth with these with this barfieldian participation now protestants and catholics can't come to agreement everybody understands that the roman catholic church is corrupt but one of the things that you notice is that it's in the hodgepodge of the holy roman empire and other places like the netherlands and switzerland where the reformation really takes hold but in these nations that have sort of coalesced into nation states well italy as as the pope reigning over it in many ways and france and spain and for a while england until henry the eighth can't get his annulment the the reformation is is really messing up the the old order of europe and again the there's no question in my mind that the printing press had a great deal to do with it this is technological disruption of the status quo and and so what that what that leads to is a new search for certainty in the renaissance world texts were the source of certainty and now even in the idea of a text a text is in some ways participatory in the words on the page you have a sacrament of sort between words which are often spoken to us like wind like spirit but are up there in the air you know platonism haunts all of this of course words on a page sort of make the words take on take on flesh take on materiality as it were and so that's that's the renaissance and the renaissance of course they're they're striving at greater latin they're striving at recovering ancient wisdom um aristotle in the 12th century comes back into the church and aquinas creates a a new synthesis for the church that of course will will will dominate and again transubstantiation deals with that my conversation with with brett deals with that but now christianity is has become a thing to fight over and and the pope can't settle things anymore because the pope's authority is no longer recognized look at what look at the way martin luther talks about the pope i mean pretty rough stuff you see things on social media today the way trump is dealt with just look at what how martin luther talked about the pope or the jews i mean it was our it was a rough rough business and so what happens is people sort of people try to go back to other forms of knowledge that hopefully will gain us a handle and bring unity and and the two places people look to are rationalism and compete and empiricism rationalism which is sort of logic that sense of rationalism or empiricism what we can what we can see which we can touch what we can taste now jordan peterson riffing on young has a very interesting idea about alchemy and i haven't really plumbed that fully but i think they are on to something that well we haven't been able to secure the kingdom of god via texts well maybe via now the materiality of the world which again because science happens because of christianity maybe because of the materiality of the world we can bring in the kingdom of god this way and so there's a turning away from texts and in some ways the divinity of words and empiricism and rationalism now via philosophy sort of begin to take the field it's a new basis for certainty and a new arena for agency so here you see the movement of renaissance towards modernity and the renaissance you had aristotle and equinas you had natural and supernatural you had nature and grace you know very very much a two worlds mythology and aristotle sort of sort of and equinas sort of knits this together but it but it's a turn towards the text and they try to you know idealize their art and their latin and their ability to manage texts now now the the the the printing press of course will change this because texts now become commodities under the printing press erasmus and allude and luther begin to threaten the church which is embodied physical authority the apostolic apostolic um i was going to say procession um apostolic succession now is threatened by the power of text and and the power of texts and you have the collapse of the hegemony of the roman church as as nations like france and spain and england start to have monarchs who in very many ways now can can look popes in the eye and through their military forces humiliate and control the papacy so so there's a lot in flux in this period so it's not just the turn towards the text it's the rise of of stability and wealth and in a sense now after the collapse of the roman period you see the re you see new what we today called nation states you see them coming up and again this is why part of the reason early on you see you see the rise of the reformation in the holy roman empire which is a patchworks of little things and and in switzerland and in the low country and eventually when of course henry the eighth brings it into england and it's going to flip back and forth rather tyrannically in england again because you've got really you've got strong centralized focuses of power and so the protestant reformation is going to cause a lot of bloodshed in england but now in comes modernity and and Galileo challenges the medieval model and upsets it and upsets the the cosmology people always like to say well Galileo beat the bible well Galileo beat Aristotle okay because that was the that was the conceptualization that was there and and pretty quickly now we are looking for certainty by physical experimentation and timing and reason and so we have the beginnings of the clockmaker universe and the idea of deism because for better or worse things seem to happen on their own if you try to stab a monk the knife doesn't turn to butter so in what way do do these ordeals work and now those of you have been following my channel a whole lot of stuff that i've been thinking through has to deal with this these issues the world seems to run on its own not seemingly by the will of god again in the Aristotelian medieval image that you can find nicely displayed and illustrated in cs lewis's the discarded image or in um there's some other videos that i found lately that that really nicely illustrate these where god is the unmoved mover and the and and the movements come through the spheres all the way down to earth as a center which makes sense of now astrology because if you see these are the movements coming towards us and these are what what are going to be manifest in the world well now suddenly everything is everything is disconnected from that and this is the beginning of the meaning crisis and many one at the beginning but this is a big event in the meaning crisis where you know now suddenly the math is better if if the earth goes around the sun instead of the other way and we're we're checking the texts against physical experimentation so aristotle says these things well how many teeth do women have aristotle and aristotle says these things and and empirical and rationality says these things so we start to put away aristotle well this habit is going to continue you've been putting away aristotle you're putting away equinas pretty soon you're going to be putting away the bible when the bible seems to contradict what happens does the sun run its course through the sky well that's poetic language oh okay well it all depends on the frames with which your understanding text and i'm not saying that the ancients were literalists i'm saying that ways of understanding texts are going to come back around certainty is found in reason and empiricism laws pay attention to that word laws make citizens out of falling rocks because they obey the laws as c.s lewis notes now a lot of people scoff at that but i assert if you think this through carefully in light of its reason you'll understand the point that c.s lewis was making now now what happens is that christians because pretty much everybody then is a christian begin to apply modernism to the texts and and modernists begin to notice well is there physical evidence for the flood used to be that well when we saw the grand canyon we saw all that physical evidence for the flood but then new models develop what about those large bones in the earth what are those from well those are from dragons oh and and you know we find dragons in the bible and dragons in mythology oh no these are you know these are now prehistoric creatures well where did they come from and sedimentary layers and all of that and so physical evidence continues to unseat textual evidence but but texts can govern the story verse um but not the matter verse and again pay attention to the ways that barfieldian participation and these fields are going in and out so this book am i actually holding a book in my hands well you'd say yes well this is quite clearly a book but if i were to burn this book would the ideas go away oh no there are lots of copies if i were to to burn every copy of transubstantiation the publishers would probably cry yes because everybody would have to buy them again because that's the thing you can't out you can't out burn a printing press so so is this actually a book or is this in some ways a sacrament of the book itself or where is the book well it was first in brett's mind and then in the editor's mind and then brett's in the editor's mind and then it was in my mind and what exactly is the book and so well texts are governing the story verse but but we're not going to use this text to govern the the matter verse and so we get these ideas of non-overlapping magisteria for example well the bible tells us myth and spirit and it's not a science book well the bible isn't a science book the bible is a very ancient book but what kind of book is that bible these questions are not that easily dismissed or sorted out um because part of the reason is that we storify the matter verse and when we storify the matter verse we can put that story next to the bible and we can begin to see oh well how do these two things come together and that's been a big project since we've been in this period well so then we have the gap theory and then we have well there aren't six literal days and we go on and on and on because we're trying to we stortify the matter verse and we compare it to this book that comes to us from the story verse and we we try to figure them out together and any christian who is reading the bible is is going to in fact want to take the bible and put it into my life we have this very interesting conversation about texts at our meetup and and i made the point that if you haven't watched jonathan peugeot's seed video i think that's his video of videos because in many ways what a text desires to be is a seed that will be incarnate so the exit signs over my church over the doors of my church are there and they wish to be incarnate if there is an emergency that text is a seed that wishes to grow into real life and the words of jesus wish to grow into our hearts the farmer sows a seed again watch jonathan peugeot's video about the parable of the soils is the parable of the sower is the parable of the soils because there's four soils is it about the seed what is the seed what do we mean by seed i think peugeot very much has that right and that illustrates what texts are because texts are not ends in themselves which is why the bible is not technically the bible is not god and i had a little fight with in some of the comments about should we call the bible divine it's probably better to call it holy okay it's set apart but is it divine well jesus says not a word you know what he has to say in in matthew five about matthew five and matthew six about the bible not a word not a jot or tittle will disappear until until what till it comes to fruition and when jesus comes to fulfill the word of god what does he come to do he comes to have it incarnated out into the world and this is part of the reason why this business between matter verse and story verse and texts is not such an easy thing and so we would say when a word is fulfilled now the participation is back on track now but when modernists apply modernism to the text you get a sort of fundamentalism all truth is god's truth um you can be skeptical about science too so this is where you get someone like ken hait ken ham that says i'm not believing any of that stuff i'm taking the bible as it is but here's the thing you've poured modernity into your reading of the bible in a way that the ancients would not have done and again this gets back to this very interesting conversation we had at our meetup should a thoroughly and authorial intent govern the interpretation of the text well that's kind of difficult in the bible because you have these reinterpretations of the text paul does it the new testament is designed to be an interpretive key of the old testament so you have that going on or is in fact god the final interpreter well that puts you in a problem if you don't believe in one because if in fact the goal of the text is to become seed and word and fleshed out in the world see i would argue that that's probably closer to the goal of all texts all right chairman mao writes his red book what does he want he wants china to reflect what's in the book well what's in the book are they words well the words are there to be a sign in a sense to be a sacrament to get fleshed out in the world all right it's a very hazardous thing according to matthew six to be using this as a sign of a sacrament but i'm i'm not about to use anything else right now because i think this nicely illustrates what a sacrament is and in in reformed language in the language of the hypercatechism it's a sign and a seal this is a when you receive this you have received a dollar but i thought dollars were material they are but this is a sign and a seal of that dollar this is connecting these two worlds but now modernist theology has understood the disruption and there's so much sunk cost into christianity that that really over the last 200 years to 300 years philosophers and theologians have been trying desperately to relocate a certain foundation for christianity if if the bible now is a rather uncertain foundation is it schleiermacher this feeling of ultimate dependence you know where can we find this this foundation for what religion is or for what god is or where can we find god if not through the text you know if you're following me there's a lot of stuff going on throughout the ages that are going to really bear out into ret and link and their decisions again their illustrations so so rationality and in many ways the christianity that they were raised in was highly rational well well here's the foundation our foundation is the word of god and well then there's this whole spectrum of of slidiness and it sounds like they were fairly on the fundamental end that says well no evolution now even that no evolution conversation talk to esther o'reilly esther o'reilly is not a hardcore fundamentalist she has other philosophical disagreements with evolution people ask me and i'll give you the same answer i gave adam friended when he asked me i believe god used process i'm not a biologist i'm not a geologist i'm not opposed to process i'm not opposed to a long time but i am opposed to it not being purposeful okay and i think that's really again if you look at the metaphysical club a book that jordan peterson has proposed often that really is the innovation and that's where the page turned with darwin and so you know we build our world on the bible science and we use science and rationality to construct our theory of the world from the bible okay scientists are using empirical data christians are using the bible and this is why it's darwin or the bible one or the other well that's it itself becomes sort of a foundation and as many have noted across the spectrum of christian ideas about this well the good people at bio logos for example that esther doesn't particularly care about uh they come from calvin college and from my own tribe um but the good people at at bio logos would say well that's a real problem when you when you set it up as darwin or the bible because when people begin to believe in darwin they no longer believe in the bible and it's sort of um nacho libre with you know him and his little friend who he baptizes when they're gonna go fight satan's cavemen so right away you see these polarities and you see how these things are working out in the community and so one of the big responses to to this deconstruction is oh they were influenced by other people another one is a complaint against the christianity that they were raised in oh if they had been raised in a place more like let's say calvin college where you know they are in fact continuing to teach evolution and all the dominant frameworks of of of biology and geology at the college this became a big deal back when howard ventile wrote the fourth day in the 80s when i was in calvin college and calvin seminary big fight about what calvin should do and it remains intention in the christian reform church over these ideas some people say if if if ret and well francis collins who was a participant in in the formation of bio logos francis collins all however was coming the other way and and francis collins found kind of a theistic evolution as a way into christianity whereas for these guys doorways can work both ways it was sort of a way out of christianity but but there's rationality going on all the way through it now just in general these trends are by no means linear or clean or distinct or match up with a timeline one of the things that protestantism did is you manifest the whole economy of peculiar traditions and positions and aspects in different places okay so any treatment of this obviously has to deal with huge generalities and these are these are processes and generalizations and in some cases stereotypes that that hopefully shed light on what's happened in our history now a lot of this stuff was going on you know into the 20th century but once you know wars sort of catalyzed nations and the cold war catalyzed the united states to fight godless communism and again i've mentioned it many times it was in during the cold war that america puts in god we trust on its coins one nation under god comes into the pledge of allegiance during the cold war american church participation reaches its peak not in the colonial period not in the 19th century not during the civil war not during reconstruction not during the progressive movement not during world war one not during world war two but during the cold war and so our noticing the the rise of the nuns and the decline of church is in memory comparison for the oldest of us with what we remember during the cold war i was born just at the end of the baby boom churches in the 60s and 70s grew the christian reform church grew to its peak i think in the late 80s early 90s christian reform church always sort of a little bit behind but populations grew people had large families but but during this period god was recruited to fight our enemy which was russia the bible and and there was sort of a heaven and earth accommodation where the bible was moral and holy and the standard and people who went to church might be priggish they might be self-righteous they might be prudish but by and large the public standard of morality during the cold war was in alignment with contemporary readings of the bible there were outlier groups but for the most part that was the framework during the cold war morality and bible reading and church attendance were in alignment if someone went to church they were considered a moral person we're going to talk about morality because morality has a big piece to play in the story of ret and link so basically the bible told us how to live moral lives and the bible told us how to go to heaven when we die and if you listen to ret and link stories you'll hear that concerns about alcoholism concerns about sex they talked about that in many ways as a young person your the bible gets brought down into certain moral frameworks don't have sex with your girlfriend don't drink don't cuss don't steal but church morality and public morality generally speaking were in alignment science tells you how to manage the world the bible tells you how to live your life that was in a sense the great compromise that that was that was made during the cold war so that america could focus and feel itself self-righteous and superior above the communists who were stacking up the bodies and to a certain degree over the nazis now as mentioned before if you listen to their story especially the first two podcasts about the lost years and their missionary work these two guys were exemplars and and and it's for that reason that they there's a little bit of self-righteousness in them when people are saying they never were really christians because in terms of the scales used for their communities they were super christians to the degree that protestants sort of have two speeds they were they were youth pastors of sorts they became missionaries they devoted themselves to full-time christian service that puts them on another level that gave them status they were sincere this this really touching story when link went to a party and got drunk and tells ret and ret does this little thing about leaving him by the side of the road and coming back and walking with him to to these two were down with him and and i don't think i don't think anybody does anybody any service by saying they weren't by all measures these two were down with it but you say yeah but were they really saved oh now we're feeling our our barfieldian separation here we're saying well down on earth they look like they're saved but up in heaven how do we know their their whether or not their name is written in the book of life well do you have access to it i don't can you find it on the internet if you don't have access to it be careful about sliding into that judge's seat all right so so let's lay aside judging these two in that sense because basically the christian position is god is the judge we're taught to discern and so on and so forth we'll have opinions but lay it aside i will take as a given these two were exceptional christian young men yeah but they didn't have the real thing well where's your sacrament show me how you're going to test this out well i compare what they've done now they've fallen away well i'm a calvinist you know perseverance of the saints yeah that's why i phrase it that way perseverance of the saints are these two dead have they are they done persevering you should withhold judgment can you see inside their hearts you should withhold judgment so so right away so my protestantism is starting to manifest myself the invisible church i'm going i'm going to withhold judgment about an eternal destination within the christian narrative of where these two are going and what their status is before the eyes of god i'm going to withhold judgment i simply am so the most important thing however in that evangelical framework is to save souls because all this stuff down here below this is temporal salvation and damnation is eternal but of course that gets flipped on its head quite a bit lately by saying well having hell as an eternal punishment is an unjust remedy is an unjust punishment for temporal sins and they bring this up too so you can see already now we've got the barfieldian separation the bar participation separation participation separation we've got this always going back and forth and and these are monkeying with our theologies i'm not saying monkeying i don't mean that dismissively they are impacting our theologies because they're impacting impacting our intuitive imaginative frameworks of what the ideal is versus the actual okay what the real is versus the actual what the governing is what the colonizing is versus the fringes of the colony now soul salvation is achieved through praying the sin of prayer well there's sort of a sacrament and again i i i think about someone that i know and hearing um this was this was a guy who had been a pastor he cheated on his wife and he divorced his wife and he left the church and he remarried and live is living a life out in the world and this particular woman who was concerned about this was a baptist but a reformished baptist and believed in once saved always saved as that goes and i don't use that phrase i use perseverance of the saints saints persevere well once saved always say what does that mean he prayed the sinner's prayer and and this is exactly what happens with rat and link well they looked like christians and so were they false christians and again as rat and link said this is try to fit them into your framework why don't you leave them alone people we have to i'll talk about this a little bit later we have to use frameworks we can't help but use frameworks but we ought to understand that they are frameworks so behavior so you pray the sinner's prayer now you're saved now your behavior is about your testimony and if you get drunk well keep it quiet because you don't want to hurt your testimony now again i'm not i'm not trying to speak dismissively or disparagingly about this particular way of being a christian i think i think it's a wonderful way of being a christian and i think in many ways the qualities of it are born out in these two they seem like wonderful human beings they're moral they're kind they're loving that type of christianity formed and shaped them and gave them abilities to to live and do in ways that in in ways that many of us can say are wonderful but now you can't be a christian without being a certain kind of christian and every kind of christian that all of us actually are will fall short against the model again now you hear my calvinist filters coming through that you know i will always miss the mark and and whether that's a an imaginative representation of christianity my the theologies that i hold and project and profess all of these frameworks will be limited because they are mine even well the bible is the infallible word of god i believe that but my reading of it is not infallible so to what degree do i participate how you know again we've got participation and we've got separation so we're back and forth back and forth now what they did was typical youth group stuff you bring in the kids with fun and now think about my conversation with burn power about fun you bring in the kids for fun because well you bring them in for fun and usually what guys like this were supposed to do was show the kids that and again this is a cold war christianity because christians are christians are prudes christians are uptight christians are straight they're not cool this is a this is a cold war christianity that has passed through the 60s and so what these guys job is to show that christians can be cool too christians can be fun so we have christian rock we have christian comics we have christian tv we have christian this we have christian that and it it agrees with this tiny little canon of okay no sex no drugs no drinking no smoking and then my if it's christian reform traditionally don't eat out on sunday or if it's baptist don't let your wife cook on sunday go out to a restaurant i mean christians had all these little rules and in order to manifest and express the theology and their ideals down below now of course in american history as sort of the walls between these denominations have been coming down and evangelicalism sort of becomes a rather amorphous marketing theological blob there's a lot of things going on in this but generally speaking these guys job was to show that you could be cool and a christian too young life had a had a had a evangelistic technique which was built on sociology of knowledge if you went into a high school and could convert the cool kids you'll notice that a lot of the other kids would follow now you can look at this cynically and say ah that's just sociology of knowledge um that doesn't god use sociology i'd say he does see and again participation separation these things are always back and forth in flux but the idea with well scream in the dark i went to those by i think it was campus life that did them in the 70s and 80s it was a haunted house you'd go through that haunted house and ah it's a haunted house it was terrifying and you'd come back and they'd sit you down and they'd give you a gospel message a little chalk talk or a little movie or something to get you to say the sinner's prayer and then you know once you've said that well now they want to form you and disciple you and catechize you into the doctrines and behaviors of the church and again i'm i'm not dismissing this now some of you have come out of that and want to dismiss it go ahead um some of you i know and other tribes want to dismiss it it's it is an expression of christianity that i think is valid and i think it's i think it has its strengths and its weaknesses okay and well how can you now we're going to get into morality soon how can you weigh the strengths and the weaknesses well you might use the bible well your theology isn't infallible no it isn't my theology isn't infallible my reading of an infallible text cannot be infallible okay so how can you judge i'm going to have to use the best i can and i'll do so within my tradition i'll do so with my tools i'll do do so with the wiz whatever wisdom i have and so what you'll find in christianity like what these guys grew up in you'll find all of those things at work now let's talk about morality because as you noted well you've got a christian theology and there's a morality attached to it and you'll say well that's a biblical morality now all of these filters of whether we're reading the bible as a first century person would read it the old testament how about as a third century person would read it you know as jonathan and his brother would read it with all their symbolic ideas as as someone might read it in the ninth century or the 11th century or after equinus or or during the protestant reformation morality is coming through the bible because the bible is our is our is our guide for and and you will find moral conversations all throughout people will recognize that well there's all kinds of moral diversity throughout history oh you better believe there was a great example again that i've used before is usury is it permitted for christians to lend money at interest and that was not permitted in the western church and that's part of the reason why jewish communities got into money lending and people don't often like their debtors so kind of set them up for some real trouble but john calvin comes along and reinterprets scripture and says you know it's okay it's if someone needs money to survive then you should lend money with no interest but if some for their food and drink or their shelter you should lend money for no interest but if someone needs money and they're going to use that money in order to make money well then christians are permitted to lend it at interest well now you've got another thing going on in the church between catholics and protestants protestants are letting christians lend money now you've got the heart of capitalism and the connection between capitalism and protestantism because john calvin reinterprets the scripture now that might make an economic point but it also makes a moral point and morality is very tricky and if you morality will also well let's let's get into this morality is tricky morality is tricky because it must by definition and virtue be universal or it fails to be morality but it's also highly contextual and so you'll find the tension between these two things perpetually with morality okay so we need to understand it as universal it's wrong to kill the ten commandments but soldiers kill criminals are sometimes killed we kill animals it's wrong to kill so so morality is actually fairly complex if it's not universal if it doesn't sort of scale up if it doesn't reach up high to to the ideal to the to the most real it isn't morality but it's got to hit the world morality is about what we do and what we think is right and wrong it's also deeply crowd sourced because we're always watching each other and we're reinforcing morality we teach it to our children almost right away and we see it in each other you cannot have community without some commonality of morality because that keeps us acting in the same place and to the degree a community rewards reinforces or punishes morality based on this communal zeitgeist this communal collective consciousness of morality you learn this as a child you learn what mama does want and doesn't want you learn what gets rewarded and what gets punished and as a family system you grow up and that family is there you learn what gets you into trouble at church you learn what you can get away with you know on and on and on my grandmother with her flesh colored stockings the elder says a young lady ought to wear stockings to church and she says i have flesh colored stockings on ah now we have a gray area are flesh colored stockings moral or immoral who can say how do you know the community sort of crowd sources this and reinforces it so right away you have this tension morality is universal morality is local and crowdsourced and reinforced and these conversations and tensions are going on always almost always continually people are rewarded for mirroring an agreement people cooperate in order to compete thank you brett weinstein this makes morality highly contextual now because morality also needs to be universal we really try hard to ground our morality in the other ways that we are grounding our world okay so we attempt to achieve universality by grounding it in our foundations if you're a religious person this is fairly easy because almost all religious texts will have moral admonitions within them and so you can one way or another ground your morality in your religious text but that grounding always comes to you through your tradition and again the example of usury i'm a calvinist i can lend money i can borrow money at interest because my morality is well you're not going to find a verse in the bible with john calvin's exception on it but in a sense i read the bible through the tradition of the calvinist church that's how this stuff works all right so we attempt to ground our universality by grounding it in our foundations this gave religious traditions a tremendous advantage partly because they're pre-scientific and if you go back to my video about the manifest image and the scientific image you have because of the way that the scientific image is it is likely impossible that you're going to be able to ground your morality in the scientific image because the line of demarcation between the manifest image and the scientific image is normativity and morality and normativity are almost the same thing okay that's why you can't get to an ought from an is because those two worlds don't see each other and you have to look at them through two different eyes and again sam harris was flipping eyes all the time but if the line of demarcation is there so then the question is well where do modernists if especially they're especially if they're positivists or scientists where do they get morality well they keep trying to build it up from first principles of science and they keep failing because again of the manifest and the scientific image because the line is normativity it's already excluded out of science that's the point that's why science works because you exclude you develop what i would say is a facsimile of a monarchical vision you try to put it in sort of an epistemic clean room you try to limit if you look at john verveckis conversation with andrew sweney john had a really nice section there on what is science and i think he's going to be getting into that because i think that would be very helpful science is a is a is a group of attempts to try to limit confusion in us but in order to do that you have to take out normativity because if you come to your science project and you say well if i do electrolysis on water i should get oxygen and hydrogen and carbon and so then any experiment where you're only getting oxygen and hydrogen you are going to dismiss because of your normativity the point of science is that normativity is excluded from it so all of this attempting to find a scientific way of determining grounding morality it's all religion smuggling it's all manifest image smuggling and this is why modernists unwittingly smuggle religious morality in because for the most part again go back to point one it's deeply crowdsourced now this is where tom holland's book dominion comes in the west's moral intuitions are deeply deeply christian all right they're not perfectly christian no christian i know is a perfect christian but they're deeply influenced by christianity the norms the assumptions the the ethos of love comes to us via the west's long-term engagement with the church now again someone might say well can you get can you have an ethos of love from a from a tradition that isn't touched by christianity that's a question that i'm not going to try to answer but i will say that the ethic that we have pretty clearly comes from the church it comes from christianity but now there's a barfieldy intention in this again and it continues to emerge because one of the things that comes into our morality lately is this question of identity now hitler in a sense with his religion tried to have a scientific morality and he looked at people and said people are animals people do like animals we have to get rid of the state and all this higher level thinking and have us and get all of this stuff out of the way so we can operate like animals and let the strongest and the healthiest come to the top and that's where he gets his anti-semitism from and if you haven't seen those videos of mine you can go back and watch those where do i get my identity from if you looked at my last video identity comes from the agent arena relationship all right your identity always has a moral aspect this is what i should be it's an idealized second self christianity gave identity do you get it from your church this is it comes from the new testament comes from the apostle paul in christ you are a new creation you are no longer slave or free those used to be identities within master slave agent arena relationship you're no longer jew or gentile ethnicity goes away inheritance goes away jesus says i can raise up children of abraham from these stones christianity undercuts traditional forms of identity and lays the groundwork for professional identity and i don't mean that plays two ways the thing that i profess to be or the thing that i was born into born into the church the thing that i am baptized into is my identity right now in a lot of protestant churches you'll be hearing things like you know you remember your baptismal identity you are beginning of the heideberg catechism what is your only comfort in death and life and in death i am not my own but belong body and soul and life and in death to my faithful savior jesus christ i am not my own that is my new identity hillar wanted to say well we're just animals christianity comes from above and says no your fundamental identity is given to you by god and that identity is more than what you were born with and that identity trumps your other identities you can already begin to see why both sides of the culture war are expressing christian ideas okay you get your identity from god well other aspects of identity remember it's part of the i it's part of the agent arena relationship well if i'm going to use the bathroom in the movie theater the identity that pertains is i go to the men's room if i'm outside the theater the identity that pertains do i have a movie ticket or am i an employee if you're in a war are you a soldier or a non-combatant are you a soldier or a chaplain see these identities come up within the agent arena relationship within the context now before world war ii eugenics social darwinism had a full head of steam going and world war ii sort of took it out of there because we were faced with what the full flourishing of those ideas about identity led to so in this most recent video when ret and link are talking and i'll put the link down below i don't remember what channel it was on it was with another youtuber when ret and link are talking about this and it's right there in the title response to religious backlash and the title response to religious backlash religious backlash after coming out well the coming out language i mean if you remember i used that in my transformation video it seems completely at home because well now they're having tensions with their family because they their true newly agnostic self has come out of you know this other identity that had been imposed on them now you can hear other other strains of the ethics of authenticity that are being manifest okay what's deep in my heart within my imaginary this is what has to come to expression that's very protestant and now now it seems to run the risk of appropriation and i'm really surprised that nobody's jumped on them but if they're flying a rainbow flag then you'd better not jump on them because they're your ally not your enemy but you know this is appropriation of that language i'm sure that language is appropriation of something else they're coming out of the christian closet as link says but here's the thing is christian an immutable property and when it comes to the debate the christian debate about were were ret and link ever true christians well there it is well what's the theology once a christian always a christian or is christianity something i can put on and take off what is christianity anyway who gets to decide if someone is a true christian what is the what is the sacrament of christianity well and you know before the protestant reformation the church decides who's a christian and who isn't you're in you're out heaven and earth are are completely together there's no separation i say who is that day is dead and gone we're not there anymore that's not what people believe anymore in fact the authority of the church is is so put away no there's who's to say but but this is but don't imagine that this is easy because lgbtq the longer that alphabet gets the the more non-immutable those categories become read andrew sullivan and you know that there's a lot of people who who are not happy with how this continues to evolve my sexuality is what i determine it to be no one can impose my sexuality on me again this is a highly protestant move my sexuality isn't well and then people will have stories well i have a male brain or a female brain i didn't get that from science this is normativity coming into the scientific method oh there might be things that relate to it but or maybe there is again i'm not a biologist does testosterone change the brain i would assume almost assuredly but but it let's say let's say someone would say okay we're going to sort out this transgender thing we have developed a criteria which we judge people's brains to be male or female and after undergoing this test the government will tell you which which sex you are based on a brain scan not the apparent genitalia that is between your legs you think that's gonna wash i ain't gonna wash at all my sexuality is mine there's infinite numbers of gender and again if you listen to rebecca reilly cooper or someone like that she's the problem is i mention these people when i talk about them and i won't remember to put all of these links in the in the note but look up rebecca reilly cooper and her talks on transgender well that means that there's gender itself as a category jordan peterson's made this exact same point gender itself as a category now then is meaningless because there are as many genders as there are human beings on the planet so you've just lost the utility of the word but this is what's happening this coming out language and so well now we're coming out as christians and then and then link says this which i thought was really well said it says not that i agree with it it still hurts when you say this is who i am and the response is this is where you're wrong there we are right there who i am well what determines who i am is that up to me can i determine that i am one of the sons of donald trull a little too old for that can i can i determine that i am one of i am one of the sons of jay paul getty i'm going to identify as the son of jay paul getty and make a claim at his inheritance that's who i am well what we know well what we know is that in terms of who we are we're all walking around with these negotiated identities i think i'm a pretty good guy other people might think i'm a jerk i think i'm a smart guy you might think i'm an imbecile i think i'm a christian there's plenty of comments that tell me that i'm not on and on and on how is identity determined now remember identity is a function of the agent arena relationship all right but the question is what is the source of identity well now we're trying to get to this word authenticity what is an authentic christian what is an off that what is your authentic sexuality is that immutable does it change is it is it a function of physicality is a is the authentic sexuality of a eunuch asexual these are very hard questions to answer but now you are not allowed well now we've got morality you are not allowed universality to question who i say i am contextuality well what do you say you are i say i'm a trout uh you don't look like a trout you seem to be doing pretty well out of water how dare you say i'm not a trout it's a little bit of a hard rule to live by if you decide that anyone who says that that your idea of who i say i am is not allowed to be contested it's not a rule you can enforce even if you have tyranny and can shut their mouth they're still going to think it they're still going to think it so christianity identity and here regard christianity cements regard for people as sacred that's human rights christianity cements regard for people as sacred human rights the civil rights movement after world war ii attempts to abolish social darwinism as a legitimation for racial segregation other classes who feel unequal take a page from that book and demand equality to women working class poor newly classified sexual groups let me get this page to turn what happens after the se after the cold war is that religion is now immoral we go from fighting godless communists to fighting fundamentalist muslims okay and it's during the cold war we didn't get an attack on new york city like we got an attack on 9 11 the problem the problem of evil after deism really rises into modernity and it takes on new power now remember the tricky thing about morality it's universal and it's contextual now for american culture we also have a sense that morality is self-evident and morality is hardly self-evident in the sense of the you know that the how we should understand the term self-evident but that tends to be how americans feel about it and and that again is very understandable because it's you take the universal and the and the contextual and you put them together and you say it's always wrong to lend money or it's there's nothing wrong with lending money at interest i don't know and you go but again read tom holland's dominion and and a lot of this stuff plays out um jesus is smuggled by the anti-christian moralists with their regard for the weak and we see this all the time but now look at the moral math in protestant christianity you join a class by profession of faith say well i'm this particular thing or i'm that particular thing my desires with respect to my sexuality now include me in a class um no externality is needed you can dip in and dip out in whenever you wish or whenever it feels authentic the individual interprets scripture not the church and you use reason and individual conscience that are many of the issues that we're dealing with today are deeply the result of the protestant reformation many of these foundations go right there christian morality is a defense of the weak and we show regard for the oppressed and we show regard for human beings woke religion comes along and the bible is deficient on various moral issues as regarded by people today treatment of gays women slavery so on and so forth and again you can find this in the the conversations and the complaints between the modernists and the modernist ag the modernist new atheist and the modernist apologetics back and forth they go is the bible moral and back and forth they go and your experience of victimhood however is your is the new sacred because now i might not be able to trust what i find in a text so what is what is what is more self-evident than my experience of being oppressed and well that then is the new foundation for morality the difficult thing that you have is that well where are you going to find the universality for this standard because if you watch willy wonka and the chocolate factory the gene wilder edition you know i want a golden lay you know i want a goose that lays golden eggs i want this i want that i'm oppressed if i've not given what i want you're going to have a moral mess pretty quickly now so when these two talk about well why they converted well there's a lot going on behind this don't blame it on california they say we were doing this while we're still in north carolina and part of the point is that in today's culture it's not your zip code a fair amount of it has to do with your community but not just the community that you might be identifying with verbally this is where jordan peterson says has his clip about well your religion isn't just what the rider he doesn't use these terms the rider on the elephant is saying if we're charting religion we're probably going to look at your behavior and of course in terms of the new gods of the future the gods of google they are charting our behavior with our smartphone in our pocket and where we go and what they do and if you read um uval harari's homo deus well the new religions are going to have everything to do with charting the new behavior and finding out what i really want because google knows what i want better than i know what i want and as we find ourselves perpetually in the mix of all of these changing moralities and changing attempts at finding well what how and how in fact will i know what i really am down deep well it's going to be harder and harder to say well to a big degree who you spend time with will shape you also it's the community that you look up to it's the beautiful people in jonathan peugeot's observation that the creatures that we see on the screen including me right now if you're watching me on a screen i'm a being of light i am impacting you probably in some ways because the screen is exhibiting light in you and that might be monkeying with your psychology and with your mind it's sociology of knowledge again it's the it's young life's cool kid strategy it's your moral intuitions now this is where i bring in this is where i bring in nathan jacobs because the big takeaway of nathan jacobs talks that he gave to the um orthodox priests was the nuns are post enlightenment and for the most part many churches are trying to resist this new defection with the tools of the enlightenment and it's not going to work because for these people that's going backwards they might not be able to articulate the foundations of their intuitions or the sources of them but they feel them in their heart this is a point that i made in past videos this was already present in christianity the old song you ask me how i know he lives he lives within my heart it's self-evidential there it is it's in my heart the new atheists and their rival christian apologists tend to be all modernists the nuns are post enlightenment their institutions their intuitions are their foundations they use reason so and they're they tend to be selectively modernist as they continue on into post modernity now i think i probably do a longer version of this video with going through the nathan jacobs video which i've gone through before but it's worth going into and i'll include it probably in the long version of today's video although this video looks like it's probably plenty long they feel confident except about one thing death because you can't get that from science and there's still a lot of science in this post enlightenment and there's still pluralism one person says this is the standard one person who says that's the standard the basic framework that you say let's say in a in a show like the good place is there your afterlife destination is predicated on your moral performance it's moralistic your moral intuitions they feel it's awfully self-evident even though they're changing the the self-evident morality of ret and link 20 years ago seemed self-evident it changed slowly they had doubts they had migration they had change but is just as self-evident as there's today and they talk about that transformation it's therapeutic that's really strong in the good place well the whole goal of the good pace is to make us as good at people as we can i don't necessarily want to give away the end of season four the the series finale but it's all therapeutic it's all about being the best we can well what are the roots of that it's not from modernity where does that come from and it's deistic you know there's this that the the universe is sort of set here but there's no person on top of it governing it or ruling over it most nuns won't rule out god but we're pretty severely buffered so i think i'll stop this for now i don't know how long this has been and if you want a longer version i think i'm going to play a fair amount of nathan jacob's video and do some commentary on that if i have the time today actually i think what i'll do is i'll just make a commentary on nathan jacob's talk to the orthodox leaders a second video maybe post it on a subsequent day so if you're looking for a long version of this video don't bother it's not here
