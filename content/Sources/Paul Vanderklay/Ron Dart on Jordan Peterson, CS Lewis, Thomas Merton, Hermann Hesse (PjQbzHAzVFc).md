 So hi this is Paul and I've had a couple of conversations with Ron Dart and Ron had some put some very interesting touchstones out there but before we get that Ron how's that how's that book on Jordan Peterson coming? Coming along quite well most of the essays are moving along quite nicely we're polishing off some of them we're looking at Peterson's contributions and thought writing and public lectures from a variety of angles I think I'd mentioned previously we want to avoid the two extremes of hagiography some elements of the alt-right do that or demonization the trendy progressive left that just sees them as on the alt-right because he dares to question them without saying liberalism is about questioning that what that historically has been classical liberalism and not very liberal of a liberal not to critique liberalism but progressives don't so I'm in that in that sense Peterson stands within an aspect of classical liberalism and so the book is just going to look at his contributions a few weeks ago I was asked his lecture at on Peterson at University of British Columbia which is our biggest university in BC one of our biggest in Canada it was quite interesting I had to have security guards there to keep the hecklers away and you would think yeah it's it's the irony university a place of critical thinking and then there are some people you can't even talk about in a university context and so then you have to have security guards to say listen heckling is out if you're gonna keep it up you have to leave the room and so this is this is one of the and all as we were doing is one point we were looking at Peterson from a sociological perspective as why is he playing such a prominent role on the public stage these days what gap is he filling in that others have been shy about speaking on what's the contribution he may be making to public discourse and what maybe some of his blind spots or as Achilles heels and I mean these are just simple elementary questions anyone at a university should ask but it gets the point where you're sort of forbidden to ask certain questions or just speak about certain people and that that doesn't bode or augur well for the future no it doesn't my goodness and I mean and it's you I mean I've done a few videos with you you don't strike me as someone out there who's either promoting or doing something to the patriarchy or something Well it says a lot about the low level of intellectual thinking and critical thinking and civility at places like elements of university obviously all you know the broader university life that's hopefully not what it's like but there's always that contingency that is so brittle and ideologically driven that they want to censor out discussion and they could be quite vocal and they try and drown people out and that's worrisome at a university I mean you can see it sometimes in the popular realm but not at a not at a university and I don't know what's going on in some classes that you know the teachers are not in elastic way teaching people to critique their own premises their own presuppositions and prejudices and those they differ with saying they have immense contributions to make I mean Gandhi once said you know I keep my enemy closest to me and and so in that sense you get to recognize your own prejudice and perhaps the good that the other is seeing that we may not see being finite infallible in that sense. So yesterday I had a talk with Alistair Roberts who's a scholar in the UK and we talked about we talked about Peterson a bit one of the things that caught my attention about Roberts when he wrote back in March of last year a blog post on Peterson understanding Jordan Peterson he let off with a CS Lewis quote and when I first started listening to Peterson and saw you know listen to what he was doing with mythology and his interest in some of that I immediately thought about CS Lewis and the true myth and some of the aspects of Lewis in you know that I heard some resonance in terms of here's a you know watching what Tolkien and Lewis did and Lewis's transition to Christianity and thought Lewis would was for I decided then that Lewis would be a good person to bring into the conversation about Jordan Peterson and so you know I've been playing with that over a number of my videos and and we before before I started recording you you said some very interesting things about Lewis and I thought that might that's probably a pretty good place to start so you you also mentioned in your email that you know Lewis Lewis for you was mother's milk how did you when did you first when were you first introduced to CS Lewis and who who introduced you yeah as you said I took in Lewis and the Inklings with my mother's milk whether it was a Tolkien or Lewis or Dorothy Sayers or Chesterton or George McDonald you know there's a whole whole range of what's called the seven who are very significant and as you mentioned most of them are mythopoetic in their background and it's not that they juxtapose myth to reason they just see that they just see that myth stories narrative classical civilizations and how they attempt and understand the relationship between the eternal and time and the stories that could be told to reveal that were very significant and that can explain ways of being that just hard inductive deductive logical mathematical ways do not get to in fact that sort of hyper rationalism conceals key elements of the human journey that the mythopoetic reveals and and people like I mean often I mean there's two sides to Lewis there is there is the rationalist and some people draw him in for his apologetics and mere Christianity and problem of pain and miracles and there's a whole range or he tries to dissect and make some sort of right limited but rational sense of how we deal with these perinealy and troubling issues that beset all of us but there's also deeper than Lewis is his is his mythic sensibilities in that sense and really his earliest inclinations and tendencies are mythic whether it's Nordic myth whether it's classical myth Scandinavian myth and so in that sense is you're rightly there's huge overlaps between Peterson's interest in myth and is early you know maps of meaning his first big Tom and Lewis and there's a whole school of thinkers that go back to a couple of centuries who they're decidedly in opposition but not demeaning or dismissing a scientific rational way of knowing and saying that the mythic the narrative the stories is a way of revealing elements of ourselves and of our journey that mere arguments can't do and the more we as it were sit on the egg of a myth we never quite know what's gonna hatch in our soul in that in that sense and so people will often people will often take Lewis the rationalist the apologist but there's Lewis wrote far more in terms of his pagey chronicles of Narnia on a mytho poetic way of knowing and I think this is this is where certainly there's points of convergence between he and Jordan Peterson what would be interesting to reflect on was be how would Lewis have overlap with approach to myth and where might they part paths in their understanding of myth because both are you know in one sense scholars one coming at from a psychological perspective the other obviously a medieval Renaissance scholar who understand he grew up with myth Lewis did as did most of the inklings and so I mentioned early also is that Lewis is somehow often but taken captive by the evangelical community in the United States the conservative evangelicals just dismiss him increasingly so but the centrist don't quite know to do with him because he's not a Calvinist and some you know were initially drawn to him because of his apologetics and turn to myth but given the fact he's a classical medieval Renaissance scholar his a whole approach to faith is quite different from an evangelical and a reformed one and so the whole Wheaton tradition that one sense is sanitized and thinned out Lewis to some degree to some degree not totally but and then they've often turned him into a Republican politically far too bright to do that and so this the thinning him out on the one hand to be a rationalist or an apologist for evangelical Christianity or politically when it's fleshed out he's on the right of center politically I don't think you can do that with Lewis he's far too nimble a thinker to be drawn into that well his his well his you know I don't know how many biographies of Lewis I've read I mean he's a complicated man and then he right then Mary's Joy David men just finished a biography of her and boy that's an interesting she's an interesting woman and that's an interesting pair and I think if you know if you look at Joy David men who even after her Christian conversion is is doing serious work in in Scientology it's a it's a fascinating fascinating story oh it is and yeah and Lewis's interaction with some of the leading thinkers at Oxford and Cambridge on interfaith issues and his whole understanding of common grace it's quite elastic and I was fortunate the fellow who is in the last battle Emmeth yeah don't know if you've read the last battle but Emmeth is one of the seen as a part of the enemy to the Narnians but he followed light wherever he could find it and the person that Emmeth was modeled after was initially a student of Lewis's at Oxford but he came to teach his final studies at University of British Columbia and so I spent some lovely time with he was formerly a Muslim family had elements of the Muslim Brotherhood when he became Christian he lived in a very delicate tightrope I remember spending the last few weeks with him before he died and asking him was the Emmeth of the last battle patterned after your time with Lewis when at Oxford and he said very much I was one of the first initially Muslims and then people come from the Middle East that Lewis was exposed to at that higher level of education he was quite intrigued how someone who comes from a Muslim background trawling to follow the light that they have would find their way to Catholic Christianity and then and then he ended up teaching at UBC for many decades in the literature department. Interesting that's fascinating. At Oxford and Cambridge there was I mean in terms of the whole interfaith some of the leading interfaith scholars were there at the time and the letters between Lewis and Kathleen Raine and Zanier and many others for that even Bede Griffiths and people like that were at the forefront of large contemplative interfaith dialogue Lewis was very very good good friend I did a book on Bede Griffiths and CS Lewis and most Lewis people just have not touched Bede Griffiths and yet Lewis dedicated surprise by joy to Bede Griffiths and it was he and Bede Griffiths that came to Christianity together in the late 20s early 30s he called Griffiths my chief companion on the journey to Christianity and one of the largest correspondents that exists between Lewis is between he and Bede Griffiths. Really? And as the evangelical right tried to co-opt Lewis it was Bede Griffiths after Lewis died in 63 said listen I was a I studied with them and the Lewis you're creating in the American or sort of the Anglo-American context is virtually nothing to do with the CS Lewis that I knew so the battle is then who's the real CS Lewis. That's I you know I that you know you're right I've read a lot of Lewis and Bede Griffiths has not come up much and so now I just pulled up I just pulled up Amazon and and pulled up your pulled up your book on that now and I noticed that not only you've got CS Lewis and Bede Griffiths but you've got CS Lewis and Thomas Merton. Yes. Now for me I read Merton I think when I was in when I was in either late college or early seminary I read you know a seven seven-story mountain and I I was just fascinated by that book at that point that was so that would be the that would be the mid 80s and so I was at that point in my own life I was you know I was a so I was exploring I was exploring Pentecostal Christianity I was exploring contemplative issues and I had a pastor who was kind of had a foot in both of those we would you know the church was exploring Pentecostal issues and gifts of you know gifts of the spirit but also we were sneaking off to Catholic retreat centers and meditating and all that kind of stuff that was you know that was the middle 80s for me and and I you know one of the things of course that caught my attention for Merton is he went to I didn't know that there was a Catholic a Catholic institution in the middle of Patterson where I was living Patterson New Jersey it's like Thomas Merton spent time in of all places Patterson New Jersey that was crazy so so what what connections did you see between Lewis and Merton? Well first of all Lewis wrote very explicitly that he thought some of Merton's writings were the very best of the 20th century on contemplative theology it probably should be noted Lewis had three elements to him and this is part of the complex nature there was the rationalist who wanted to make sense as far as you could through cognition and various forms of logical empirical arguments there was the romantic Lewis through myth and all that revealed but there was also Lewis the mystic and a finding book has come out also on that recently the actually the fellow he and his wife have now taken over the Wade Centre at Wheaton into the region of awe which is a very nice looking at Lewis's connection to Evelyn Underhill and Dean Ing and the emergence of the the emergence of the whole contemplative mystical tradition in the Church of England at the beginning of the 20th century of which Lewis was very consciously indebted to in his journey and he corresponded with Evelyn Underhill who was great classic work mysticism was probably the preeminent work at the beginning of the 20th century so Lewis has this mystical contemplative side that goes deeper than his romantic rationalist side but the complex nature all three are held together in a very delicate and wise and judicious way now Thomas Merton as you mentioned his first book that sold into the thousands after 1947 when it came up seven-story mountain many people come back from World War two face tragedy and death and they're asking the big questions what is the human journey about when you've lived in in that way it was really a very honest and transparent and personal journey to faith and you can obviously see the mystical contemplative longing of Merton in that and he then turns to the Catholic Church but finally to the Cistercian order and so of which some of the great Cistercian writers like Bernard de Clairvaux and William St. Thurie and Hilda de Vauvoo people like this emerge and so they both Merton and Lewis share this center of the contemplative in that sense it's what they both share with TS Eliot and again Lewis and TS Eliot became the best of friends the last 15 years of their life after sparring for 15 years and so Merton on the other hand Merton on the other hand was very fond of CS Lewis he thought CS Lewis is one of the finest writers of the 20th century so what often happens is you get the Merton people the Roman Catholic the contemplative the meditative who are sort of in the Merton tribe or clan but they don't know a lot about the Inklings and the CS Lewis people who have been co-opted by the evangelicals of course Merton wasn't reformed or evangelical so he but then the Inklings many of them were Anglican or Catholic so you can't shrink them to a reformed evangelical way and so what Merton and Lewis share is a Catholicity rounded in the classical tradition which at the core is a contemplative mystical heritage and so when one breaks out of the way they've been what shall I say cabin cribbed and confined by their tribes they both transcend that and you can see where Lewis and Merton come together as dancing partners in terms of in terms of their understanding of their faith and how you how you live it but the dangers that this is being overcome I think I've been in a variety of events the last few years in which people who have emerged within the Inklings Merton Lewis clan are beginning to see there's much too I mean you can't study the Inklings and not move in a Catholic direction that's just a given and so when you move in that direction you're going to bump into Merton and Merton is probably one of the most significant pioneers of the revival of the contemplative tradition of the 20th century and so inevitably these two come together as intersection on the trail and so there is this fascinating convergence occurring between people searching for depth and finding it both in the Inklings and Lewis and also finding it obviously in Merton and then the whole spin-off industry both of Merton and Centering Prayer and the whole meditative traditions and they're they're sort of second or third level activists or thinkers of which Merton is much more the towering Everest in that sense but the you can't separate the deeper you go Lewis from Merton even though many have but I think that sociological reality is being overcome as people are looking for greater depth and meditative ways of knowing and they can take the path of Lewis and the Inklings but when they do that they're going to bump into Merton and people following the Merton contemplative path in time are going to eventually arrive at the Inklings and Lewis what they share also is a great suspicion of the Reformation forward. Lewis considered the Reformation a tragic farce and Merton the more he probed the patristic and classical tradition he eventually became more ironical like in Seventh Story Mountain he's you know like new converts can be a little belligerent and thinking they found all the truth in the way and he changed his tone considerably after Seventh Story Mountain and you find a maturing a softening a broadening out in Merton which he would have picked up in the best of Lewis as well and their understanding of interfaith issues. I think also neither could be trapped in the tribalism of right left or center politics either and that's I always get worried when people want to either pit Merton into leftist anarchist protest politics or Merton into or Lewis into Republican politics it's they're too subtle and nimble thinkers to be trapped in that cage or that Procrustian bed. So was there was there much letter writing between Merton and Lewis? No what you get in there there there were both prolific writers not only published articles books but in terms of letters and journals the Merton will mention Lewis a variety of times and Lewis mentions Lewis mentions Merton and they also their names come up in letters in which they're writing to other people so the more one probes the letters written because both are prolific writers I mean one sense their vocation one out most people know them through their books and their articles but actually the libraries of letters they wrote they really took correspondence as a vocation and and so once you get into their volumes and volumes of letters you can their names pop up and they mention people will ask who would you suggest I read to going a little further and deeper and Lewis will mention Merton and Merton will mention Lewis. Interesting that's fascinating I haven't I haven't dug into Lewis's letters much and you know it's it's fortunate that you know he of course Lewis was a very famous famous letter writer in terms of trying to respond to everyone who wrote him which was a Herculean task given you know typewriters and fortunately Warney was there it sounds like who pitched a hand so that's that's fascinating I had never I had never known any connection between the two or thought of the two in that connection I've paid over over my lifetime considerably more attention to Lewis and again always had favorable feelings towards Merton but never really pursued him much but that's probably just part of my location in the you know but in terms of where my where my life has where my life has panned out. Yeah there's a series of articles emerging they have been emerging in the last few years on comparing and contrasting Lewis and Merton I gave a lecture at Regent College a couple years ago because Regent is a Regent College in Canada on the West Coast right I mean the the Inklings and Lewis and this group are much lauded within that centrist evangelical tradition the relationship of faith in the arts and culture and this the sort of business of which then the Inklings offer an alternate to a too busy confessional approach to faith or a narrow or exegetical or being too fixated on creedal approaches and the corrective to that is people are trying to look at relationship of faith in the arts faith and culture faith and painting faith and music this sort of but they haven't really explored because really it's only up to the last couple of decades that the reformed evangelical tradition has become more open to the Roman Catholic heritage and once that openness occurs and underneath that openness is the question of a new generation asking questions about a contemplative meditative way of knowing well as soon as those questions are being asked then you're right on the holding hands with Merton on the journey well it's you know just in my lifetime I've really noticed a laying down of arms when you know when I was going out typical Christian Reformed at least part of my life was typical Christian Reformed a lot of another part of my life was very untypical Christian Reformed but you know I went to Christian Reformed day school and and then Calvin College and seminary and you know the the telling of the Reformation was I mean these were this was the this was the revival of the church you know the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit flew the coup somewhere after you know the Apostle John on Patmos wrote the book of Revelation and then suddenly came back down on Martin Luther and off we went again but that you know I can even tell in my you know and just my cousins in a in a small town in Massachusetts if they were you know if they were when the Christian school teachers came in all the mothers of sons were looking very hard to make sure that they would you know find a Christian school teacher and settle down before fear that their sons might marry a Catholic girl and today even in that small town you know doing joint projects and services with the Catholic Church which is literally right across the street from the Christian Reformed Church that is an enormous change in a small amount of time with almost no theological conversation and and and so that then you know that that lowering of that wall then allows now we can read each other's books and we thought we can they kind of started with Henry now when of course because the Dutch CRC well Henry now when's Dutch so he's Catholic but he can't be all bad if he's Dutch yeah there's two directions going on sociologically isn't there at the present time there's the attempt to overcome the silo ism and the tribal ism of various theologies and ecclesiologies which flow from that and say listen we share a Catholic heritage in terms we are all part of the one holy Catholic and apostolic church how we understand that is going to move us into the future the other is the reaction to that that's happening at the present time are reinforcing those islands and and then and then bad mouthing and dismissing and demeaning people who are not say of a reformed tradition or of an evangelical tradition or elements of certain elements of the Roman Catholic tradition or the Orthodox where the true church you know and the pure faith was locked into the second of the sixth centuries and so we're getting two things happening sociologically one is a generous overcoming of the tribal ism rooted in a Catholic a Catholic contemplative theology the other is a reinforcing of of a tribal ism of the past and it much hinges on where these two directions unfold into the future but it's definitely being played out in a variety a variety of ways at the present time and Lewis and Merton certainly point in the direction of that Catholic contemplative what some call generous orthodoxy I don't think McLaren is very deep in his understanding of that term and I think he is a bit of a boy you're in a dilettante but he's pointing to something that when explored in a more substantive way in terms of contemplative theology similar to Peterson pointing sort of the post evangelical revisionist they're they realize that they have lost much in a shrinking of faith and they're groping for something older more rooted more grounded they don't have the goods but they're pointing and others perhaps will pick up on that and next generation will have a much greater depth theologically exegetically historically on how that's going to be understood and lived forth in you know post Christendom post secular post scientific sort of broadly speaking interfaith world and how how people of faith engage those questions without slipping into a too easy pluralism which really distorts in many ways or relativism or syncretism which is which is not which again distorts and Lewis was exposed to all of this very early this post-christian as was Merton and so their writings on how one does interfaith dialogue are very rich and and the the veins in the gold mine are very insightful so there's tends to be two traditions one christianity has nothing to do with other religions we're the good true and beautiful and if you're not of us then our jobs to convert or isolate ourselves the other is a convergence which essentially says they're all going in the same direction or they're just different paths the middle way is to say no there's a way through this one which honors the christian tradition which looks at the concord between religions but there are discrete differences at core level and it's only when that is understood that you understand Lewis and Merton and how they made sense because the future is really as people are growing beyond you know the scientistic and the secular models they're asking the big questions what do other faiths offer in that sense I think Merton and Lewis and there's many others for that matter can offer markings or karens on the path in terms of because they've gone further and people are asking those questions these are the people that should be reading and internalizing now last time we talked you introduced me to a german a german novelist herman hesse hesse who who actually wrote a novel that won a Nobel prize and and I noticed in doing a little bit of research before we talked today that that you've got a you've got at least three videos out there on on this novel entitled the glass speed game and I did a little poking around and looking at it I haven't I haven't read it but it's it strikes me that we're we're focusing you know so has hasa wrote it in the 30s you know obviously for lewis the 30s was the time of his conversion you know a a world war one a world war one veteran he had the right kind of wound that allowed him to to survive the war obviously the death of his of his buddy didn't you know move him in terms of his relationship then with his friend's mother and that whole arc and lewis when did when did merton come to faith well merton I mean he came to faith in the late 1930s okay so and then his question is well what form should my faith take because obviously when people come to Christianity the next question there's variations ecclesially theologically exegetically and he moved fairly quickly into the roman catholic tradition he taught at st bonham and chura for a time but he he vocationally merton was very drawn to the contemplative heritage which is foundational to catholic theology and he thought the monastic tradition would provide the pathway he became sorely disappointed when he entered the cistercian order realizing they were busier with their divine offices and their farming than was new york at rush hour and so the monastic tradition which was supposed to be a a font of the contemplative merton through much of his life was at the heart of unearthing the rich layered christian contemplative heritage theologically and how you live it but also it's what drew him to interfaith issues too because who are the people who are practicing these these approaches today so whether it was dt suzuki or dali lama to this day considers in some ways merton his his mentor merton spent his last days a few visits with the younger dali lama and darm sala and he considers he variety times he's gone to gosemite and just sat at the graveyard of thomas merton dali lama he holds merton such high high esteem as he said when i think of christianity i think of thomas merton ticknott hawn the great buddhist monk many people read ticknott hawn's his works on awakening and mindfulness but he fled vietnam when the americans were bombing and merton was became very good friends i corresponded with ticknott hawn for a while as well but but yeah so herman hesse there's again like merton and lewis there has been been many misreads of herman hesse there's the herman hesse of europe and germany the highly cultured european artist writer novelist poet and he was mostly unknown in north america until he won the nobel prize in 46 and then all of his writings in german began to speak to emerging counterculture so anyone who was in any way interested in the north american counterculture of the late 50s 60s and 70s a rite of passage was to read herman hesse he was the guru of the counterculture the dilemma of that was he became so knit together with the counterculture variety of books he wrote is that as the counterculture that wave crashed on the shoreline and disappeared hesse disappeared with it because he was equated as the guru of the counterculture in some ways and so he almost disappeared for a few decades and gratefully so in the last 10 to 15 years there's been a renaissance of herman hesse and the much more mature hesse who grew up in one of the most influential german pietists families in europe parents were missionaries both in india and so hesse grew up with that but it he felt too constricted and confined and much of his journey is is a growing out of that german pietism but a great respect for the catholic tradition in this sense hesse anticipates louis and merton so he doesn't some people say well herman hesse he turned from his christian faith to the east that's not what anyone who reads his journey to the east or glass bead game or siddhartha he's he's because there's this tradition of many in the east who turn against christianity turn see science is inadequate to fulfill the deeper human questions secularism is not working and so there's a romanticism of the orient whether it's buddhism hinduism some variation of confucianism or daoism so something that hesse was at the forefront of pioneering a post-christendom post-science turn to the east and even his small little miss of journey to the east most of your language going to the east that's not what the title is about in any way hesse was looking east in german it's it's the word that's actually used is you're turning to the you're turning to the the source of where light begins to dawn again east in that sense where the sunrise is not east in the sense of the orient but most people read it as a manifesto for turning to various forms of oriental our religions and has said like lewis and merton i might add a voluminous correspondent many people hesse was one of the first critics of german nationalism and the belacan spirit that led to world war one he fled he fled germany went to switzerland where he spent spent his days and as things began to emerge in the 20s and he saw hesse saw far ahead of his time what was happening in germany and was writing in the 20s against it long before hitler came to power and many german immigrants who fled very good friends with thomas man and many of the great german writers his home in switzerland became a sort of a refuge refugee site for the european intellectuals who saw you know things are not right denmark here in terms of what was happening in europe in the 30s and and so hesse was this probably one of the most significant european writers of the 20th century who was thinned out a bit by the american counterculture the late 50s 60s and 70s and gratefully there is this phoenix-like revival of him and his great work is the glass bead game uh and at the heart of the glass bead game are these intellectuals who are trained in castalia they're the crammed a ment of all thinkers and they're trained to the game essentially is one of beads of thought of various cultures and religions and philosophical traditions and trying to trying to string them all together in a great synthesis because the the glass bead game comes out of the period of the great wars when cultures and religions had clashed and fragmented and killed one another in the name of religion and politics and nationalism so the vocation of the castellans the elite of the elite were trained to reflect on can we move into the future by synthesizing the very best that has been thought and said now hesse's he's poking fun at this a little bit because the castellans as it were lived on mountaintops and like they were in monastic contexts and so the question always was what's the relationship of this highly sophisticated synthesis of the noblest that has been thought throughout time and history cross civilization cultures into a great unity is moving into the future what's the relationship of the vita contemplativa and when you go down to the mountainside where the ignorant armies clash by night or the vita activa and of course magister ludi or joseph connect in that sense he reaches the highest level of castellans but he has various students that say well what's the relationship to this very um this very sophisticated synthesis of thought and actually people who live their day-to-day life in the valley where nations fight and tribes turn on one another who they're not interested in this sort of stuff and can this be made relevant in that sense the similar universities are like castellans in that sense trying to synthesize analyze dissect and in that sense has new all this world inside and out and in one sense elements of the brittleness of thought when you deal with power politics and i mean you get this in obviously in platos gorgias and the republic and all of these issues when what happens when power and wisdom collide what then is a person to do but the glass bead game is probably i would consider one of the most important novels of the 20th century i won't say he won the nobel prize for he won the nobel prize for a whole life of contribution to european literary poetic political economic life and so uh but he shares a great deal i mean in when merton was on the last stage of his life in 1968 he's reading herman hesse whether it's the darth or a variety of a variety of other works and um hesse was deeply catholic in his thinking some people when they're raised in you know certain backgrounds they find too narrow they turn against it uh hesse was too wise and ironical and pastoral and kindly his view was what was the good in what i was raised in and what may be some of the blind spots what is the good in the catholic heritage one of the most lovely chapters in the glass bead game is two orders so you have this intellectual class the castellian synthesizing thought but joseph connect goes to essentially benedictine abbey and meets father jacobus who uh says you know this is this sort of new age synthesis sort of uh is interesting but we've been around for thousands of years and we know how to institutionalize these more difficult uh issues and so there's a fascinating conversation between and there's a variety of people who today are trying to synthesize ideas and religion science and secularism and one grand synthesis and they're just castellians in that sense and hesse saw that played out but they're they're grounded in nothing institutionally or no real substantive community which carries that memory forward and so that lovely chapter in two orders is a very significant and probing discussion between intellectuals who play games of integrating ideas and synthesizing ideas cross civilization time as we move into the future what carl yosper is called the second axial age uh and what happens when you greet people who've been doing that for 2000 years like benedictine catholics who know what it means to grapple with those things so that the two orders is a fascinating discussion of sort of a brittle intellectualism that synthesizes but's grounded in nothing historically so that's probably one of what's that go ahead yeah so it's probably i think one of the the most superb intellectual novels of the 20th century of someone who had lived through the dynamics of the role of intellectuals trying to make sense of where history is going hegelian like and yet on the other hand what is happening in the valley of nations and cultures and ethnicities that will just for most part just ignore what's going on amongst castellian or university culture in that sense and so it's an interesting study of the role of thought in a contemplative meditative way of knowing that's about synthesis in that sense journey to the east is the first little primer that's worth reading and then um has to dedicate glass bead game to what he calls the journeyers to the east so these are companion books uh and they're they have a perennial significance of someone who lived through the 20th century and saw the relationship between thinking and the brittle nature of elements of thensises which are not grounded in any historic communities which carry the vision forward and live through these crisis's of power and wisdom so so i'm just pulling up a little bit of information on hesa died in 62 louis died in 63 merton died 68 68 okay interesting any um i i don't recall you're the one i'd never bumped into hesa at all until you mentioned him uh you know the and so that i was listening to the the videos that you've that you've got out there and i'll put those in the i'll put those in the notes here for people to listen to them it's it's uh i thought i found the the videos that you did with brad jersek about these to be very you know really very quickly brought me up to speed could understand you know kind of where this is going you know it's it's interesting how you know louis louis was a you know he was kind of the picture of the of the professor who is so smart he's not worth a darn thing i mean he didn't drive um he you know what what what could what could louis do for himself uh but as in terms of how his at least the best that i know of in terms of how his faith worked out beyond his vocation obviously of thinking and writing uh you know his the amount of personal benevolence he did i mean he'd give away he'd give away all of his money and then oh my goodness i have to pay these taxes on the money i've already given away get himself into trouble and of course joy david and then you know the whole you know louis if someone's gonna be a personal manager of louis oh my goodness what a what a disaster the man was but but then taking the form of this simple anglican so he you know in many of his essays writes you know writes about you know going to church and can't stand the music and all of this but then realizing that the the simple anglican that he's sharing the the bench with who's who's a gardener or some such thing how louis esteems him so you know all these this beautiful louis finds his finds his christian pilot you know piety in this in becoming a simple anglican of course he writes about that and in screw tape letters quite a bit merton goes and becomes you know you know becomes a monastic becomes a monk in the 20th century of all places and and here has a you know escapes to switzerland and writes what any anything and and then of course the glass speed game you have as i listen to your as i listen to your tapes or the the videos of you you're having this you're having this okay so so so we've got the intellectuals playing the glass speed game in some crazy ways you know the the glass speed game brings us the bomb obviously in the 40s i mean this period of the of the 20s 30s and 40s such a such a concentrated packed period of the 20th century where you know so much as being worked through you know one of the things i often reflect on is you know thinking about our times with this you know the kinds of culture war things that peterson is addressing i often note resonances between now and the 30s and in terms of wrestling with all of all of these elements you know one of the things that gets quickly forgotten after the second world war is the ubiquity of of eugenics up until the 30s and it's it's almost like watching the nazis made the west say all right we're not going to talk about eugenics anymore and now obviously with the increasing power of ai us looking towards ourselves to say we want to make machines that think well how do we think and so watching the rise of cognitive science i've been paying more attention to john verbecky lately it's it's interesting that these these elements such as lewis and merton and has coming out of the 30s you know responding to world war one i read i forget the author's name but a very interesting book about the religious aspects of world war one again something that wasn't in any way um world war one is often kind of glided over as the predecessor for world war two where you know which was the big bang in so many ways so it's interesting how the relevance of these writers who very much were molded and shaped by the first world war and came into their power in the 30s and then 40s lived into just the beginning of the 60s it's interesting how now obviously let's say an 80-year time frame that's enough distance now that we can sort of look back on them with enough distance to find interest and it's interesting how these three come together and and in a sense how these three have come together through you and in you now why why do you where do you see those lines connecting well one thing you mentioned which i think is pertinent is there's a tendency with lewis merton and hesa just to look at the sheer wealth of their literary philosophical theological contemplative element but they were also a people who you mentioned earlier lewis would go to a very simple anglican parish as a medieval renaissance person chaucer's canterbury tales is what matthew arnold calls god's plenty and the great difference between the common person that you're there for who will i mean they would wouldn't understand to lewis but he was there for them to be by their side often be misunderstood not heard most wouldn't know who he was in any sophisticated sense but he was just there sitting at the pew taking the sacraments quite different from the bunion puritanism in which i'm right i march off alone i leave my wife and the kids in terms of some pure faith and so you get the same thing in merton the monastery you know most in the monastery it grew from about 40 to 50 and because a seven-story mountain it grew to well close to 400 in a few years and it drove merton crazy but again most didn't understand merton what's a monk writing about politics and the nuclear issue and first nations issues and environmental issues just do the divine offices and teach the novices and he was often misunderstood but he was faithful in love to be with those who misread him misunderstood him and the vow of stability which is i think a very important in an age of mobility that we live in the notion of stability in parish or in merton's case monastery in lewis's at oxford or cambridge or his parish for herman it was his home in montagnola southern switzerland where he stayed stability he was not i mean one of the great spiritual virtues is stability and when we're in take a vow of stability it means we have to be with people we don't always get along with we see things differently they say things which you think what you know what planet are you coming from or we're a few bricks short of a load you know um and so one of the common threads that interest me about them is how they thread together fairly sophisticated cultural intellectual literary thought with a simple piety in which you're there for the person in the pew and the monastery or the people who come and see you at your home in hospitality and you don't judge people or just hobnob with the literary elite or the philosophical elite when that happens it's a form of veiled narcissism and to me the test you know lewis had a lovely saying the the ripest are the kindest to the raw and the most studious have the great amount of time to spare and i think one thing about the three of them in their different ways they were deeply pastoral and they brought together fairly sophisticated i mean you know teaching in oxford or cambridge and the i mean merton was almost prolific writers the 20th century hesse wins the nobel prize we're not we're not we're not talking you know about people that in one sense had not made it culturally they had they had reached the very peak culture but they never took their laurels in a way that would make them in any way demean the common person they knew deep down they were common people their gifts were their gifts but they shared a great affinity with the common person in the pew and i found in for me um you know uh because the tendency when you're university trained and you teach in university and you hobnob with people who conferences and books and writing and your world is castalia for the most part is you know the common people what or what nichi would call the herd why do i want anything to do with that and that shows a definite lack of charity and a definite lack of pastoral concerns and the tendency is to flip from one intellectual place to another one retreat center one guru to another and yet it's in the simple life of family and the simple life of the parish in merton's case the monastery and hesa at his home that you see this integration this integration of meaningful thinking with pastoral care for the common person and i think i found both them very helpful in that because you can have people are very pastoral but they don't think a lot you know their relationality and it's pastoral and i mean but when you get to serious cultural they're just not there you can't blame them the danger of intellectuals is they distance themselves from the common person you know in the pew and even when they attend church and they just stay with those they know and that's that that shows a lack of love a lack of charity a lack of being so in the sense lewis's chaucer's canterbury tales is a wonderful story you get everything for the gentle perfect connect to the wife of bath and everything in between they know where they're going they're going to canterbury where becket was killed by hand readers but they're a very complex group and you just stay together on the trail in all your imperfections and you don't get sort of little purist elite types but you recognize the human condition for what it is and the task is can we actually initiate going out to people who are not like us and of us in that sense they embody a sort of pluralism and multiculturalism of the soul yeah that is way ahead of their time so i would say in terms of what they have taught me over the years is how you bring together um fairly sophisticated cultural literary philosophical theological political life with common pastoral concern for your average person as they go through the hatch match and dispatch seasons of life you know and so that that's where they've taught me a lot and they become in that sense men to me does that make sense oh yeah it does again looking at hes's doesn't appear to have married well no well he did he yeah he had a very difficult first marriage oh a very short second marriage which was very painful and then he with ninon uh he spent most of his last decades of his life have children yeah yeah he had a few a few boys okay three boys yeah three three boys and uh uh quite a journey he had he was a very sensitive artistic type and so he constantly his life is a it's a fascinating story of the art whose vocation is an artist and how do you deal with the slings and arrows that come your way i often found his first book really spoke to me in the 60s uh it's called under the wheel and it's the story of what formal education can do to a creative person when i was in high school in 60s i mean i just didn't fit into the curriculum and i felt like i was under the wheel the curriculum constantly ran over me i would be bringing my teachers plato and aristotle and wanting their reflections on the poetics or you know what are your thoughts in the bible here and comparing these great texts and and the fathers and of course the teachers would say to me that's irrelevant just cover this is what you gotta do but i said that doesn't interest me i'm interested in and and so what has it experienced to school he was constantly under the wheel of a formal curriculum and he was crushed by it and i i often found his book under the wheel always was helpful for me in the 60s 70s because i could relate to what has a experience i did terrible in high school i failed twice and i never finished and i left with the saying by mark twain don't let school interfere with your education and um and traveled that's where i initially ended up in switzerland and my mom sent me a book by schaefer escape from escape from reason i'd been traveling and living with the somi way up in northern norway equivalent to the what we call laplanders and she said why don't you go to this place given where you are in your search and this would have been the early 70s and so i ended up ended up hiking with the franciscan up to lebrie wow prior yes so uh so but yeah so for about seven or eight years i couldn't even relate to formal education i was under the wheel of the curriculum that crushed me trying to think creatively about what's important in life and what formal education doesn't provide that teachers didn't and so hesa was very helpful for me on that interesting you know what as you're talking one of the things in my own little jordan peterson meetup group we have in sacramento i've noticed i've noticed again this strange which has been true of my congregation at living stones living stones is this outrageously diverse church that has had people who are illiterate i'd have to help them write checks because they didn't know how to write sitting next to phd's and even in the you know even in the meetup i've got people who are like you they've dropped out of school some of them dropped out of school frighteningly early but gone on to be successful in whatever field which is i think more and more difficult to do today because the information systems are so tight that if you you know it's harder to falsify your resume just to patch over something that yeah you can do that job but if someone says well you don't have a ba or you don't you might even have a high school diploma they're not even going to talk to you and but it's but and sitting next to some folks who are phd's some university university professors come to the meetup too and it's it's interesting again this this nexus that you've you've kind of weaved over here of how to how to put it but but where people who are people who are interested in not only the glass bead game but but also the the life the life of the life of getting hands dirty and the life of the life of sitting with sitting with sitting with anyone you know under understanding understanding the richness in the people that most of society will never pay any attention to because they don't show up in they don't show up in the ways that we rank order others so um oh that was beautiful yeah that's why i love that's why i love louis's quote that the ripest are kindest to the raw and uh if a person has had the privilege to get a lot of formal education but they're not pastorly interested with the rawest you know the rawest parts of the human journey then to me their learning is just an opiate in that sense yeah you know i learned so much of that from my father who um you know spent most of his life my father was a very obviously a very bright man but spent most he had a had an offer to go to the free university when he graduated calvin seminary which was in that in that school that's what you did you went to the free university in the netherlands and you you know got your degree there and then you would come back to the united states in the christian reform church and but instead he went to paterson new jersey and spent 36 years helping people there are many times when i was a teenager and he'd say oh paul you got to come with me because we've got to move someone and so we'd be we'd be huffing and puffing with stoves and fridges up you know and and this was this is how my father spent his life and you know a library full of books but but happy or so able able to realize that you know all of these books are wonderful but a single a single human being has more mystery in them than a library full of books and if you're patient and quiet enough they might just open themselves to you and and you can see glory so it's a it's a beautiful beautiful thing yeah if we don't i think your point is wise if we don't go from the wisdom of books to the book of a person's life before us then we don't understand the purpose of books yeah yeah and then books and education becomes a form of escapism so your father was obviously a deeply honorable person in the way he integrated those two yeah yeah and and i think you know one of the things that you know a healthy tradition we're talking in our meetup about you know what is a what is a healthy culture a healthy culture is the kind of culture that can afford to give to its youth the kinds of wisdom they have not yet had time to amass for themselves and so my father growing up within within his tradition learning this so that he could you know he could embody these things and pass these on to those he worked with and obviously myself who grew up in his home and so on and so forth so well i really appreciate this talk ron this is this has been lovely and i i've learned a ton and was able to make some connections i didn't know existed before and thank you thank you so much for you know spending this time and and and why i mean i i just enjoy being able to you know hear you know being able to plug in and and benefit from your wisdom and your reading you know as a pastor of a local church or you know i'm a generalist so i get to read books but i spend time with people and to deep dive into some of this stuff and i don't always have the opportunity to so i really appreciate this oh well a well-laden table indeed so i'm gonna i'm gonna stop the recording and then we can we can finish up okay
