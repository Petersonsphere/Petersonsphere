 Hi, this is Paul and I am recording here in the beautiful country of Australia And this is my rough draft for the second talk that I'll be giving at in Melbourne in old St. James old Cathedral. I just did a radio interview st. James old Cathedral and Very much looking forward to it now as I said before the other one that what you hear on this could be completely different come Saturday I Work through things very quickly every morning I wake up and I run through the talks and I change them sometimes I change them a little sometimes I change them a lot Sometimes I change them completely. So if you think well, I've heard what he's going to say on Saturday Well, maybe you have and maybe you haven't you definitely won't hear exactly what I'm going I'm definitely not going to say exactly as I say here It will definitely change because I always change my talks By virtue of the audience and what I learned about the audience and I'm going to learn a ton between now and Saturday but at the same time I have to practice and get ready and I Could sit in a room and talk all by myself But I found it through my Sunday practice my rough draft for Sunday series that it's really helpful for me to talk through things And to stumble on things and to rework things in my head. It just makes it sharper by the time I deliver it Now as with the first talk the second talk will begin with a little interview that I did with John Anderson Who's the former deputy prime minister of this beautiful country of Australia? Let's just look at the scenery behind his behind his window there This is a this is a beautiful country and I'm very much enjoyed being here. And so John and I did a little talk I'm not gonna play that that's that's that I'm gonna say for Saturday So if you come to the conference you get to see it and then I'm gonna do a little clip from Vancouver one with Jordan Peterson God number one and God number two's I've played this clip quite a bit But I'm going to do this because I think this is at this moment that the conversation with Sam Harris really gets engaging Now I believe that Jordan Peterson could be the most important person in the history of Western belief since Charles Darwin And why do I say that? Well, first of all people's beliefs are seldom linear Often we think that if if someone demonstrates or proves X to me then therefore I will believe it and rationally apply it to my life This seems to be the guiding psychological presupposition Behind a lot of rationalism and as a pastor I find it simply to not be true pastors and clinical psychologists know and Generally speaking any self-reflected human being should know that we as human beings do things for very Mixed reasons and often for self destructive causes We simply do not do not work rationally in this way and you can read Ian McGill Christ's The Master and his emissary you can read Jonathan Haidt the happiness hypothesis But or you can sit down and ask yourself now Why did I do that stupid thing or say that stupid thing to realize that we don't functional we seldom function on a rational Basis that's just not how we work There is power in this however We sometimes can sit down and think things through and sometimes do have the willpower and determination To apply it to our lives So there is power in this but not as much as we would like to believe We we act for our own reasons and we are mysteries to ourselves Persuasion is far more complex. In fact, you go all the way back to Aristotle who did a lot of work in this Persuasion is a very complex thing Jesus knew this look at Jesus teaching Jesus. If you look at the way Jesus taught he was not a rationalist He made arguments. He told parables But the way Jesus taught in many ways was speaking to the elephant and not just the rider now Jordan Peterson often recommends this book by by Louie man, and The man at the metaphysical club and one of the key insights and points I got I picked up from this book was that Before Darwin many Christian scientists believe there was the list theistic evolutionary process and how the world was made Darwin's big introduction was the assertion that evolution could explain origins without The guiding mind of God that was a crucial turn in the history of in the history of Western belief now Here's the difficulty could you actually prove that now? You can't actually prove it you can make some demonstrations and you can be persuasive But if you dig into this there's not really much you can prove about it partly because it's difficult Actually prove just about anything Now the Apostle Paul when he gets as he works his way through chapter 1 Says this the wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness And wickedness of people who suppress the truth by their wickedness Since what may be known about God is plain to them because God has made it plain to them For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities his eternal power and divine nature has been clearly seen being understood From what has been made so that people are without excuse now part of what's behind Paul here is the observation that for Nearly all of human history for nearly all of human civilizations There was a concept of God or the gods that was floating about this is this is nearly Universal and what the Apostle Paul is essentially doing is making a psychological argument a lot of Christians Imagine that if we can get a lot of people to again believe in God then somehow Everything will be set right now. I personally believe that's While I certainly want people to believe in God I don't think that trick will do it for the reason that before 1500 as Charles Taylor said belief in God was Axiomatic almost everyone believed in God in fact when you find Psalm 14 verse 1 the fool said it says in his heart There is no God that's hardly atheism because everybody in the ancient world believed in God or the gods Basically what the psalmist understood was that even if everyone imagines that there's a God out there that God doesn't care Or isn't looking or is negligent or for some reason or another is not involved and I can exercise my Autonomy and my own authority in ways that I please I Think what this gets at is the deeper truth that we find in Genesis chapter 3 that we as human beings Deeply resent and mistrust God's legitimate claims on this world and our lives The serpent begins by saying did God really say Once we get the idea that there might be a God we suddenly have a problem And that problem is what to do with this God We seem to be more comfortable imagining that if the world is chaotic or Impersonal then at least we are in control and we have choices, but if in fact there is a God well What if that God? decides things for us that we don't like we find this deeply troubling and and deeply problematic now Darwin's big contribution Psychologically, I think is essentially this it's the easiest way to resist God's claim since Genesis 3 is to say that he has no hand in the making of the world and So what you'll hear often is random mutations But if you pause and think about what we mean by random, we don't really mean Necessity we usually mean mindless But but what we also mean is that At this particular level there could be physics working But it's too difficult for us to observe to describe or to predict and so we use this word Random and so we don't really know that no mind has been directing it We just know that our minds can't comprehend it That's essentially what we mean by random and so Darwin asserts that well we can explain the origin of life simply through Randomness now, of course, this has been a big debate in terms of you know How many monkeys for how many years with typewriters do you need to finally? Have them produce the complete works of William Shakespeare And since of course we have a set timeline in the universe via the Big Bang Can we actually arrive at that simply via random and that's that's a huge discussion that I won't go into and you can find that discussion on other YouTube places My point here is psychologically Darwin's move had a big impact now Charles Taylor points out that this in fact did not come out of thin air But was a further development of what Charles Taylor calls Providential deism that Before there was no God there was a distant God who made the world and left it alone and simply Spun it out there it's the clockmaker universe and God is the clockmaker and he wound up the world and spun it out there and Now it's up to us now when these ideas of providential deism were coming to the fore God in fact was there, but he was benevolent and providential And so that God in fact set up the universe and set up the world in a way that is benevolent to us We get down to contemporary atheists and you have no such promise of course Now this is where Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris really get interesting There's a youtuber called mouthy Buddha who is not a Christian in any way that I can describe But but in early on I think it was in May 2018 He made quite a persuasive video that essentially said is Sarah's Sam Harris losing his audience to Jordan Peterson And the answer he came up with was yes See Sam Harris sides with Jordan Peterson on many issues the importance of science the importance of free speech membership in the IDW but Sam is worried about Jordan Peterson and that's where these conversations between Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson and either Brett Weinstein or Or Charles I almost said Charles Murray that isn't it I can't think of his name right now Esther's Esther's really gonna kick me for that, but that's where those conversations came about because Many in the IDW are concerned because what Peterson seems to be is at least giving some sanction and giving some If they're paying close enough to tension though the attention Realized that Sam Harris is losing his audience to Jordan Peterson because people are at least have at least become a bit God curious now Jordan Peterson asserts the idea of God is foundational to the psychological stability of liberal Western freedoms and I played some of that God number one stuff and and I think some of you listen to that and Probably listening to it for the first time probably thought what is he talking about? Without God there is no free will I'm gonna give you some bullet points here that weren't necessarily made there But these are things that Peter these are points that Peterson has made throughout without God or and I put God in quotations here because Peterson Still continues to be I'd say publicly and open agnostic with respect to the ontology of God and Metaphysical claims he wants to make a minimal case argument here that even if you can't believe That Ontologically a God exists without God there is no free will or responsibility And our Western freedoms and systems of law would simply crumble without the idea of the image of God There is no human rights and our system of liberal Western freedoms and ideals would crumble without God There is no idea of the future or be there is no idea of the future or belief in sacrifice for it This was a big point he made in his Easter video back in 2018 And in fact the only reason in a sense the future is dependent upon this idea of God That has gotten built into us from years and years and years of development and evolution all of this a Priori framework that Peterson over four two hour long Conversations tries to convince Sam Harris is not only deeply Necessary for us as human beings but has been proven again and again in terms of the history of philosophy You cannot get to an art from an is and that this forum for action is Necessary for us the the perspective of the world being a forum for action is Necessary for us to at least make sense of this myriad of data and objects Which the world is but also our stable liberal Western freedoms are built on these things Without God and in fact in many cases Peterson would argue the God revealed in the Bible You're gonna have to Peterson's gonna play around with that word I'd be revealed at least the God spoken of in the Bible the God represented in the Bible without God You don't get human reproductive hierarchies based on competence and those of you who have listened to a lot of Jordan Peterson Know that these are key elements of his argument Peterson in a sense says that all of these ideas came to us psychologically through the Bible Peterson is making his argument in a sense on Darwin's shoulders So you can't dismiss Peterson as being non Darwinian or non scientific because he in fact is both Peterson is making this argument as someone who doesn't identify with the church So you can't dismiss him for being a Christian in a sense what he is saying is okay, I'll give you Darwin so maybe we'll say that random process could account for the world as is presented to us but psychologically We can't get the kinds of things we enjoy without at least the idea of God and the Bible Representing a God in this way these things are foundational for our Western system of government for our Western society for our Western freedoms and all of the things that we have enjoyed now for At least a hundred years So Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris get into it Jordan Peterson will say you need God to have the world we enjoy and Sam Harris says that isn't a God that I've been Defeating or at least protesting since 9-eleven And it changed that Jordan Peterson says you and everyone in the West who embraces Enlightenment values actually live Psychologically as if this God is real It is built into the way we act in the world and if you stop you'll lose Western freedoms and of course Jordan Peterson via the culture war believes we are in fact in danger of losing them now and This is where I come to my schema of God number one and God number two Jordan Peterson is saying It's basically an advocating for God number one now a lot of people have asked me Well, can you continue to explain this God number one and God number two for me? If you want to understand God number one see Romans one this God that reveals himself in general revelation This is the God that you see in the axial age now you may or may not be familiar with this point this connects to the John the John Verbeke stuff But but it came about at the ends of the Bronze Age that this split in the world where we begin to imagine a new world a World where decay does not ravage a world where we can go when we die a world that can save this world of pain and decay God Darwin said didn't need So God number one so God number one God said Darwin This is the God that Darwin said we didn't need for the material world. I should change that slot This is the God Darwin said we didn't need for the material world the God Jordan Peterson says we need for the Psychological world without this God we simply lose everything that we have come to enjoy Now who then is God number two? Well, God number two in the Bible would be considered the living God not just an idea But an active agent in the world today and in the past relational active personal agent in the world and in our lives Now, how did we get from God number one to God number two? Well since the Enlightenment? There've been a lot of post-enlightenment attempts to rescue God In fact the history of a lot of Christian philosophy Philosophy in general for the last couple of hundred years and a fair amount of Christian theology for the last 150 years has been trying to rescue God from the ravages of Darwin and the Enlightenment and modernity and I think part of the motivation for that was the West had so many sunk costs in Christianity Christianity was simply so Foundational for everything that that the West had become that to to simply lose God was to lose too much So there were been there have been all kinds of revisionist attempts to well Maybe we can't believe in an actual God and so maybe we're going to find God in a feeling of dependence or a Variety of ways and a lot of this is bound up in the modernist fundamentalist fight the West had many sunk costs in Christianity who's Should be whose had so many sunk costs in Christianity I'm gonna have to fix this slide the West had so many sunk costs in Christianity that those responsible for Western Civilization kept trying to save God from Darwin. We should say probably save God number one Third time the West had so many some costs in Christianity that those Responsible for Western civilization kept trying to save God number one from Darwin We needed God number one for knowing how to behave Psychologically even after we thought we no longer needed him to explain origins or history and That left us with another split world You know the modernist compromise with in a sense God the Bible was no longer an authority on history or science The Bible continued to be an authority on moral behavior how to act in the world Modernism however suffered a fatal blow in World War one But is kept alive so that God could help us fight world fight the Cold War now this changed in the 70s 80s and 90s as God number one in a sense was retired evangelicals pumped more and more interest in God number two Evangelical save Christianity with God number two and this is in fact the God that Sam Harris protests Chuck Colson is probably the best illustration of this he grew up in a mainline Church and he was a good soldier for Richard Nixon well Richard Nixon wasn't anywhere near as loyal to Chuck Colson as Chuck Colson was to him and Friends around Chuck Colson introduced him to a personal God now now when Chuck Colson had his conversion experience His wife was a little bit upset because his wife had said now we've always been Christians We've gone to church all our lives, but Chuck Colson now saw himself living in a personal relationship With God this became the mainstay of evangelical talk now. This wasn't a new introduction Christianity has always had God number one and God number two and and Christians especially Christians who are not nominal have have long had a Personal relationship with God that wasn't a new element, but this became the central element in Christianity as God number one receded via Darwin so you have neo-evangelical ism, which is probably the best label for it exemplified by Billy Graham and others Compensated for the loss of God number one with more God number two Now in 9-eleven the Cold War ended now you might say well the Cold War ended with the fall of the Soviet Union and the destruction of the Berlin Wall and in many ways it did but Sociologically these things take a long time to process 9-eleven sort of became the turning point Where we were no longer as concerned with godless communism needing God needing the Christian God to help differentiate us from our atheist Adversaries now suddenly we were at war with violent Islam Islamic terrorists Church attendance peaked in the United States during the Cold War and I would dare bet it probably did pretty well in places like Canada or young Jordan Peterson participated in the United Church of Canada 9-eleven marks the anxiety shift from godless communism to religious Fundamentalism and it was really 9-eleven that launched the new atheists with books like God is not good And what you see here whereas before the Bible Many retired God number one as the source of our origins Now suddenly we're regular. We're ready to get rid of God number two as the source of our morality the morality of the Bible is obsolete as It's science is as obsolete as its science people would say and we need a new rational morality a Little bit later on we have the rise of critical theory Jordan Peterson calls this postmodern Neomarxism and it's basically understood that the world is best understood as a struggle between groups oppressors and oppressed all organizing meta narratives religions and worldviews are simply power plays by oppressors Except critical theory itself, which is of course a meta narrative and which many have argued Ah, that's also a power play, but you can't live without a meta narrative so they embrace this one and So all other narratives should be deconstructive and it's our duty to liberate people from every kind of oppression Everywhere this subtly sneaks into the church and this in fact replaces Christianity for some in the mainline Church Now critical theory and religion the Bible like all meta narratives is written by oppressors So the charge goes like all accounts of history besides their own and must be denounced and banished See Jordan Peterson and the IDW rise for the fight because what they realize is that in the end? Science is lost the objective world is lost Jordan Peterson and the IDW rise for the fight we lose governance for the physical Biological sciences and that's why you see these modernist scientists mostly atheists Lining up to say critical theory is a bad idea Now Jordan Peterson says if we lose the Bible as our foundation will lose everything we enjoy in the West now That's quite different from Sam Harris who says that the Bible is simply obsolete ancient Iron Age Technology and ought to be discarded But what Jordan Peterson has done in a sense by standing on Darwin's shoulders is that God number one comes back into the picture as a necessary element of psychology and this is why he reads the Bible psychologically So God number one is in a sense new evangelism now does this mean everybody's piecing this together no but our brains are piecing it together and Jordan Peterson might not even quite understand this in fact often Jordan Peterson acts surprised when people come up to him and they say I've really sorted out my life and Jordan Peterson's like good does and now I'm going to now I'm going to church and Peterson doesn't always seem to know quite what to make of that I'll be where lecture number two ends and then we'll get into lecture number three
