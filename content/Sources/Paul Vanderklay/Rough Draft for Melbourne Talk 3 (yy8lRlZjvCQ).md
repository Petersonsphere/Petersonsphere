 Hi, this is Paul and this is rough draft for my third talk in Melbourne and like I said for all the others as a disclaimer because After walking through my other talks they might change 100% completely between now and then and the same is true of this talk. I Walk through these talks verbally to get a sense whether or not I like them And if I don't like them, I'll throw them away and start a new one In fact, I've got plenty of rough drafts of this but I haven't I haven't had the time Or the opportunity on my little vacation here to to sit and talk through them but I've got kind of an afternoon because I did a radio interview and so I'm gonna make videos and I'm gonna post them. And so if you're in the Melbourne area, please come Peterson phenomenon org and you can buy tickets There's still tickets available and I'd love to meet you love to see you. So let's jump in as With the other videos I begin with a conversation I had with John Anderson and I'm not gonna play that because the debut is going to be in fact at the event So you'll have to wait and see what that's about and I'm gonna play a clip from the biblical series where Jordan Peterson Gives a little bit of what he what he does. I'm not gonna play that now either And give a little bit of review Jordan Peterson has been on a status rocket fueled by the meaning crisis and the culture war Let's talk one why Jordan Peterson might be the most important person in the theism conversation since Darwin God number one and God number two that's talked to Now one of the things that Peterson says all the time in his biblical series is that he tries to make everything Practical and when Peterson talks about why his biblical series have been have been so well received not only by some Christians but by atheists and Muslims and Buddhists is that he tries to keep everything as practical as possible That has a great deal to do with his project in meaning because as he rightly notes meaning Trump's Happiness life is suffering throughout history people have suffered for the sake of meaning Women have given birth and mothered at the cost and risk of their lives men have fought in wars Given their lives in risky labor at the cost and risk of their lives and in many ways you can see that reflected in the Curses in Genesis 3 Do what is meaningful and not what is expedient? I remember one interview where someone asked Peterson what the most important? What what which of his most which of his 12 rules was most important? And this is the one he chose do what is meaningful not what is expedient And if you listen to the many conversations that I've done with individuals you can hear that Reflected again and again a big part of the lift in depression is the rediscovery of Meaning that speaking the truth that acting in the world That picking up your heavy cross and carrying is it is in fact meaningful Peterson remarks again and again that when he talks about responsibility in his lectures the audience gets Quiet and that is because taking responsibility Inherently fills us with the experience of meaning and in this contemporary world we long for it Well, why well, let's talk a little bit about sacraments Those of you who are familiar with church know about sacraments in the Protestant churches There are two sacraments the Lord's Supper also called the Eucharist also called communion and baptism The Roman Catholic Church has seven sacraments now in the axial age and again This is some of the verveky stuff axial age religions deal with the suffering in the world By believing in a world in which there is no suffering this world is a place of decay Suffering and frustration. What do you do if that is all you get out of life? Well, there is a heaven that is possible and it's a place of eternity Where where time does not bring decay where there is no suffering where there are no tears where there is no loss And one of the ways to redeem the suffering of this world is in fact To hope for heaven and to work for it to pick up that heavy cross and carry it up the hill sacraments Connect us to heaven in Christianity Jesus Christ himself is the ultimate sacrifice in the gospel of John most explicitly he is the man from heaven who bears witness to the truth that God so loves the world that all who believe in him can have eternal life and not simply be subject to this Now this obviously is poured into the sacramental system You must be baptized unless you eat my body and drink my flesh John 6 says you can have no part of me sacraments connect us to God and this was an integral piece of Obviously the history of Christianity in the east and in the west and came front and center on Stage during the Protestant Reformation that we'll talk about a little bit later Now again, if you go back to John Verbeke stuff in the meaning crisis He lays it out this way as he's following in a sense Charles Taylor that initially there was the cut the continuous cosmos before the axial age where there's just a Enchanted world in the axial age you had the split world and that according to Reveke religions employ Psychotechnologies to combat suffering with meaning using meta narratives So in fact you can drag your head your heavy cross up that hill there is a hope for heaven There is a way to in fact endure suffering and find meaning and in Christianity I would assert Christianity makes meaning makes suffering Meaningful that's what we see on the cross and what we see is the reconciliation of heaven and earth and I didn't close that Once again, this is one of my styled rough draft video So I will pause it and change slides and change things midway and as I said before if you're deciding well, I'm not gonna I'm not gonna come to the event in Melbourne because Paul's just gonna tell me what he told me here. Well, it might be completely different I will have the John I will have the John Anderson talk though And I probably will use that Peterson clip but the Peterson clip could change too You have this new continuous cosmos where in fact in the modern age Darwin destroys heaven indirectly and and post-modernity destroys Meta-narratives and So what are you going to do with suffering? Can you find meaning in this world and this I think is part of this age of anxiety and drop a picture in there now Part of the way the church has had to respond is to adjust its tactics and I've already mentioned the Shift in emphasis to God number two over God number one and part of this was expressed in moralistic Therapeutic deism but the church in fact has been trying to rearrange itself in the West in terms of evangelism for quite a few decades Now in the 1980s and 90s you had the seeker movement really Led by by Bill Hybels and and Willow Creek said this is a safe space to hear a dangerous message but you notice that worship spaces looked like secular college auditoriums because it was Bill Hybels belief that crosses and that the baby boomers if they walked into a space filled with crosses and obvious obvious religious obviously religious Artifacts that this would disturb and scare Secular baby boomers and he had a point the the seeker movement was tremendously successful among baby boomers The music was pop or jazz now in the in the in the 2000s the Xers They tried to reach out to the Xers and what you had was an emergent pushback on the seeker movement And and what this produced was two out two new flagship congregations and they were both named Mars Hill This was a way to engage a skeptical audience Taking from Paul's engagement of the Greeks on Mars Hill that you can find in the book of Acts But it went in two very different directions You had Rob Bell who has continued to move out with this progressive Evangelicalism and you have Mark Driscoll with his young restless and reformed movement now now neither of them I don't know if Driscoll is pastoring anywhere now But but they both in a sense head out in different Projectories and that shows in many ways a lot of the split that has happened in Western evangelicalism Now in the 2010s what we began to see is that a new form which was what I call neo-sacramentalism And this may come as a surprise to some of you, but Anglicanism is the new hotness Many pastors that I know would really love to be Anglican Why because somehow the Anglicans have managed to preserve doctrinal integrity in some cases along with weekly communion and baptismal font front and center and liturgy the new wave of church planting is all about re-embodied Christianity for a new world Following Jordan Peterson. There's a renewed interest in orthodoxy the kind of Orthodox churches that are that came over often as Churches from the old Soviet Union And they've they've grown in the West What's interesting is that some of the leading people in that area are Jonathan Peugeot? Who's kind of been a partner in crime and making YouTube's about Jordan Peterson and Peugeot was a personal friend of Jordan Peterson's But there's this renewed interest in sacraments because we wish to re-embodied Christianity because it's sort of been floating away from us So you have a new desire for embodied belief now Fun shout out from Jordan Peterson via David Fuller David David came out to Sacramento and did an interview with me when he was on the West Coast collecting video and one of the things that I'd mentioned about Peter system is a fair is a stoicism in His teaching and and and David challenged Jordan Peterson on that and Jordan Peterson said well Because I said well, what's at the top of the city of the hill? You're getting all your meaning by carrying your cross up. But what's at the top Peterson said? Well, he hasn't been listening and I thought really and he said the city of God the city on a hill That links Peterson in a lot of interesting and different ways Now I had a little Twitter spat with somebody about Jordan Peterson's gospel Well, Jordan Peterson doesn't pretend to be a Christian Jordan Peterson isn't trying to do church growth But part of the reason people are coming to Jordan Peterson is because he is in fact Re-embodying the gospel in a Back that up Jordan Peterson is promoting a Re-embodiment of meaning now many have noted that Jordan Peterson has a rather Augustinian Anthropology own your responsibility for the suffering in the world. Don't blame somebody else Take your responsibility in it I just today posted a posted a conversation that I did with with with Nolan Watson and Nolan as you can see is He lives in a wheelchair and a respirator does the breathing for him And when he mentioned to me that his favorite book is the gulag. I thought my goodness Here is a person who does not have use of his limbs or his body and he is taking Responsibility for the suffering in his life and I thought to myself if anyway, if we would give anyone a pass on on Suffering and blaming it would probably be someone in his condition, but he owns it. That's very Petersonian It's very Augustinian but now Peterson's sacrament his way to embody Meaning is to pick up that cat heavy cross drag it up hill to the city of God now Of course this follows Jesus admonition to take up your cross and follow me. This is Peterson's sacrament Is it a pelagian soteri ology? It kind of reminds us of that. I'm not gonna go into the the the The details of pelagius and his fight with Augustin, but but it's a very interesting combination combination You in a sense save yourself and the world by moral action in keeping with the Bible now in fairness to Peterson This puts us front and center back into the Protestant Reformation where all of these things come together It's interesting how many of these issues that Peterson is dealing with are very much the same issues that the Protestant reformers were dealing with in the churches and None of this is coincidental because we're dealing with all of the issues that set up the enlightenment and all of the consequences that happened afterwards But the new thing that Peterson brings to brings to the table is this new appreciation for the Bible as psychological authority That's fascinating Now meaning is Jordan Peterson's sacrament read maps of meaning just look at the title Read the book if you can We were made for meaning to be emotionally essential and pragmatically productive You can watch his maps of meaning course on YouTube and that's essentially the thesis of it We are made for meaning if you don't have meaning you will have nothing else and you'll be a waste of a human being in The story of the world so you have to go out and grab meaning with both hands which means pick up responsibility Take do something hard don't just sleep with a woman marry her don't just don't just Impregnate a woman raise your child and of course for for Christians. Well, this seems to ring true This is a very common morality that we're used to hearing about But all of these loose ends of the Protestant Reformation in many ways remain in terms of the split between the Roman Catholics and the and the Protestants which again puts the Anglican Church in a very interesting position salvation is salvation for Peterson is improvement in your individual life of the for the world in your Edit this slide salvation for Peterson is improvement in your individual life and for the world overall once Individuals engage in their meaning they make the world a better place And I think this is true and this is part of Peterson's point and you can see the tensions with conservative Christianity and the axial age formation a lot of this stuff runs in in parallel, but the Peterson is in some ways With for Vicky and saying well, can we really? reenergize reenergize the actual axial age imagination Are we justified in doing so those are the questions that tend to linger? My question is what will be the church's response the church is currently divided and typically so weak and Is currently is is currently and typically weak and divided I did better when I wrote my slide The main line is playing me too with critical theory as I call it progressive liberation ism Fundamentalists tend to hunker down Evangelicals try to work the middle Will there be a place for Jordan Peterson? Place for the Jordan Peterson followers should change that Will there be a place for the Jordan Peterson followers who are God curious Bible curious and church curious That's my missi illogical question So I'm gonna give a little bit of advice this lecture looks a little short So I'm gonna work on this once more But I'm gonna post this anyway because I need content and I have an internet connection and I have a computer. So why not? Be quick to listen and slow to express judgment. I Think this is one of the key missteps Christians have made so far and listen and engaging Jordan Peterson and his followers If you already have your theological background, can you find differences between yourself and Jordan Peterson? Absolutely, of course, of course you would are you going to lead with that or are you in fact? Just going to listen take the time to learn think it through because finally If you're a Christian people matter because people matter to God Invite them into your spaces to process. I started a Jordan Peterson meetup in my church and Whereas before any of this happened Churches try how many silly things to to just get People who aren't part of their church to darken the door in This case I've got people coming in and what do they want to talk about? I want to talk about God they want to talk about morality. They want to talk about what we can know They want to talk about philosophy. I would have given my right arm for this two years ago And here it is and who can I thank for this? Jordan B Peterson and the movement around him I can't for the life of me figure out why churches can't see the missiological Opportunity here. Well, like when I listen to them I can hear oh They don't want this kind of people or this kind of man or this kind of message to be associated with them And I find that instinct Terrible because while we were yet sinners Jesus died for us so Core of Christianity is laying down our lives For our friends all the way up to and including our enemies when swords were drawn in the Garden of Gethsemane and Peter struck the ear of the priest servant Servant Jesus healed his enemy and basically said if anybody's blood will be shed here. It will be mine This is our Lord if you're a Christian So learn from their insights We don't know enough the harvest will teach the harvesters So that's it. I think all of these are I might throw them all out and start all over I don't know. Well, we'll say I never throw everything completely out It's it's always a matter of editing and again as I'll probably go in where with 10 or 15 talks in my In my pack and as I get to learn the context and see what's happening. I'll Mix and match and get the right ones. So again, if you're in Melbourne Come by Love to meet you listen to the talks But but again that the key thing is Find some people to talk to Find it create a space where people can process That's that's key in this because in in my experience real change happens when people have the opportunity to do their own work and If they invite you into the process Well, this is this is what in my opinion evangelism is all about so thanks for watching. This one's fairly short Interesting see that's why I talked through them because you don't really know and still you tar still you start until you start gabbing So see you next time
