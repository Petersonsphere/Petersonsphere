 Transition from a vague leadership team to elders and deacons. So it really just any questions maybe in this last Section and sometimes I've found this with Maybe you have to like maybe do we just purge a bunch of questions and see what the questions are before we enter in? Because or do we just answer one at a time or what? But I feel like throwing them to you But if you have an idea if you've got a set of questions Because sometimes if you put the questions out you can see oh, here's a clump and then you have to deal with those Or we can take them one at a time either way. It's fine Has this been helpful? That's my question. Oh, yeah, it's great. Okay And she's already signed the thing Yeah, you have I think you signed it in classes do you want to classes no I did oh you're gonna sign it soon then I don't know. Yeah Because here's the thing when you go to classes the first thing they say is you can't participate here unless you sign oh Well why Because it gives us a platform upon which we can at least begin the conversation Right right good correction so questions Yes Use mine too. Well this stuff is all online now You can go to the website of the Christian Forum Church and look at what we believe and you'll find The Humbert catechism the Belgian confession the canons of door and our world belongs to God and now with the internet you can Google conversations on all this stuff because on a number of the I Mean almost everyone today if they read some things in here, they're gonna read something say what's with that well Google it You'll find people talking about this stuff And I emailed you guys What it's worth reading it's worth reading It's not super long, but it's good good stuff. It's about the history of race and the Christian Church So Are these Is this considered like the The Christian Reformed Church says that these documents are not to be considered on the level of scripture and In fact these documents are subject to revision on the basis of Scripture So I'm wondering if there's more because I you mentioned the Belhar confession What are these like? Any church and They'll sign Yes Yes, because you can be a member this is All these things are debated now I have Joe Ho's witnesses come to my door sometime and if I have time and desire I'll start to ask him questions because sometimes I know more about what Jehovah's Witnesses believe than the person who comes to my door You're gonna find that in the Christian Church, too That people believe what they believe Even if they've signed this they might not have ever read this but basically what they'll say is I hear my pastor preach Every week and I think I agree with what most of what he says so I've been in the Christian Reformed Church I believe what it believes I've heard people who are died in the world born in the Christian Reformed Church educated in the catechism say things that I think That's that's directly contradicted in the creeds and confessions, but they just said it at a classist meeting and nobody bad at an eye Happens all the time It's just kind of real life Now someone could stand up and say What you just said is direct in direct contradiction to Heidelberg catechism question and answer 74 They're not gonna do that in a class this meeting now. Maybe their pastor might want to take a plot say let's talk about this thing That you said I Mean, that's how we work on things in our culture Classes pastors one of the questions they asked us at the end was do you believe in all the Confessions all the things What And at that time I said The position of the Christian Church on women in leadership But then we changed But that's not a confessional issue because that issue isn't in the confessions And so and so again part of the way this works in the Christian Reformed Church is and why we have it is so that When there's when someone is a leader in the Christian Reformed Church, there's ideally a standard Against the which that person can be judged and that's a little different from what often happens in North America Which is well, I'm pastor of a church What does that mean? Do you have an education? What do you believe if I meet someone who's a Christian reform minister? I at least have some assumptions. I can make some assumptions about what they believe within a certain realm And we can start our conversation there I think it's interesting to have this in context of Billy Graham passing away a couple days ago and being America's pastor and got really short what that my mom was so sad about that and You know, there's reasons why she's sad, but like what does that mean for him to be America's pastor? He's not Hope or a leader, you know, and so it's interesting to have to think about This the scripture that we have it's written in its own context the creeds and confessions that are written in its own context and it gives us The ability to have conversation use similar language to enter into conflict there are That's really cool that there if there are disagreements that seem to be foundational or you know deciding how a building should be Redesigned that there are specific things that we can have to discuss like these are foundational ties It's it's super helpful so that you don't always have to start at zero That takes a long time Okay, so I have a question the place so I the only place where I've ever run into issue people go When I say a part of reform church somebody that is Calvin you didn't mention Calvin at all. Yeah, so where's he going? That's the only place I run other people who are either involved in some other denominations in some way that they know Their denomination believes in contrast to others or or if they may be into a Bible college or something like that The only place they go I'm not reformed, you know, they like quick like that's it It's a big and I don't know how often you run into that day-to-day life But I went to a Christian University like two years ago So I still run into that with people and I have other friends who are worship pastors at other churches and things like that There's a Richard Euler taught at Calvin Seminary for a number of years one of the foremost scholars of Calvinism One of the most read papers he ever wrote was entitled was Calvin a Calvinist So John Calvin was a French refugee in the city of Geneva and He wrote Calvin's Institute's Calvin's Institute's Kevin was a second-generation reformer Calvin's Institute's became a tremendously popular book during Calvin's time in Europe and It's a huge book Calvin kept Calvin's Institute is almost like a blog He just kept adding to the thing and there's so much in there and in a sense Just like Guido de Bre was arguing with the Emperor Calvin was arguing with the Pope and saying these are all the ways I agree These are all the ways I disagree He wrote a lot He had a tremendous influence in his generation and a lot of people followed him and Took what his ideas he had and expanded and developed them the Belgian Confession and the Heideberg Catechism express the same General area There were a lot of scholars like Calvin who believed similar things in that period those two documents express in broad terms a lot of that belief the canons of Dor is a later document and it expresses a lot of later developments what happened with Calvinism and and so That when Americans talk about Calvinism That's usually what they're talking about and so fights amongst Presbyterians who are English cousins of the Dutch That's these are the things that they're usually fighting about and most of the time out in public When I hear people talk about Calvinism, this is what they're talking about When I talk about Calvinism, I prefer to try to camp in this layer Because this layer gets pretty far into the weeds and a whole bunch of different areas And this is in contrast. I just actually read a thing from CS Lewis CS Lewis was really peeved at the was he was a medievalist. He was really peeved at the Protestant Reformation His take on the Protestant Reformation was it would have been better if Martin Luther and the Pope and Erasmus Is that all set that sat down behind closed doors and had a good conversation together And maybe slowly we could have made some of those changes in the church and kept on the same page kept the church together But instead we have this massive bloody public fight that did a tremendous amount of damage to the church to European history And to Christendom and the whole thing is lamentable Unfortunately, some of that happens at this layer of Calvinism and if you read Calvin and his institutes, you'll find that we hold a tremendous Calvin loved church fathers and So I prefer to stay at this level of Calvinism rather than fight about these levels But this gets gets popular to fight over this But I think we're getting kind of passed that down a lot of ways which is probably good Which P word Perseverance of the Saints that's P and Tula Are you mean predestination and election of course election election the doctrine of election? I? Just recently heard Tim Keller asked about this and I thought Tim colors answer for this was great He said when I talked about election I would prefer to talk about it in the context of the Bible rather than Calvin Because in Tim Keller colors presbyterian context when you say Calvin and the doctrine of election You jump all the way into this level The Roman Catholic Church embraced the doctrine of election Martin Luther embraced the doctrine of election John Calvin embraced the doctrine of election and So it's best to go to the Bible and talk with Paul about election And that's difficult as it is, but that's a better place to start the conversation And so that's kind of where I stand a lot of Calvinists today want to fight about it They want to make it a fight. They want to make it an enlightenment period fight. I think we're I Think we're reaching a post enlightenment period now Where maybe we can have a better conversation about understanding how the Bible talks about election and in terms of our documents themselves What do we say about our documents they're subject to the Bible so if you start with the Bible? Any friction that you have in here should be manageable because it's at that level that we're talking So when you talk about P in terms of Calvinism I'd rather talk about perseverance of the Saints because that's actually more pastoral than election Election is pastoral and that's how Calvin embraced it because he said he said this we all have doubts Well when you have doubts, what should you do? You should believe in God's sufficiency to hold you More than your sufficiency to hold on to him. I think Hold you more than your sufficiency to hold on to him. I find that very powerful pastorally We do not hold on to God. God has us in his hand. He's a lot stronger than we are And that goes to that that's right I read I read on this issue. I read I was reading the Kansas door again, which is the thing I was least familiar with in here in terms of My upbringing and stuff and I I couldn't believe how pastoral this reply was and it just gives us window into What the middle you was of people wrestling with election at the time so it's article 16 of like the first big section and It says responses to the teaching of reprobation Those who do not yet actively experience within themselves a living faith in Christ Or an assured confidence of heart Peace of conscience a zeal for childlike obedience and a glorying in God through Christ And so in a sense, you know, I've met a lot of people who come to church who come to church and worry I don't have I Still tons of doubt. I don't really have assurance. I don't really so am I Condemned like do I have to worry? I'm going to church. We do it for so that I'm thinking how it just labels this person But who nevertheless use the means by which God has promised to work these things in us The means what are the means the means of grace preaching the word sacraments? Such people ought not to be alarmed at the mention of reprobation Nor to count themselves among the reprobate. That's right rather. They ought to continually or continued diligently to use the means To desire fervently a time of more abundant grace and to wait for it in reverence and humility And I could go on because it labeled it lists another position you might be in But I just thought wow, what a pastoral answer and really practical for Yeah Is the other position that you might be in Really practical Yeah Yeah on the other hand those who seriously desire to turn to God to be pleasing to him alone And to be delivered from the body of death But are not yet able to make such progress along the way of godliness and faith as they would like such people ought much less To stand in fear of the teaching concerning reprobation since our merciful God has promised that he will not snuff out a smoldering wick And that he will not break a bruised wreath. I mean even that like However those who have forgotten God and their Savior Jesus Christ and have abandoned themselves Holy to the cares of the world and the pleasure of the flesh such people have every reason to stand in fear of this teaching as long As they do not seriously turn to God Oh A bandana As and then yeah, it's interesting because then yet I've served your kids I Don't know if this gets to you but I guess So I could find anything and I was actively looking for it So oh, but I think what we can find anything about Inherency or infallibility scripture. I don't know if that's too new of a conversation for it to be in the Contentions back. Well in the hyper catechism, it'll talk about You know part of the fruit of faith as you begin to realize that everything in God's Word is true now this this Parseling out of inerrancy is a far later conversation and and this this battle about Bible comes as a result of The the feuding the reformational feuding between churches and then the desire later to find a new Foundation apart from the Bible by which Europe can find truth and unity And that then gets us into the modern a more modern philosophical conversation. But yeah, the the the These documents come out of a world in which You know the truth of the Bible was simply assumed Broadly and so that's so yeah, so that you know some some a few items in the Belgian confession a few statements in the in the hyper catechism, but for the most part assumed The Bible is the Word of God. This is how the Belgian confession two books God reveals himself through nature and God reveals himself through his word all this Fighting comes a lot later after the enlightenment And our world belongs to God will have some more statements about that because that again is an issue That is more in our time, but it's not going to wait into inerrancy versus infallibility And they really are good documents just to read them It's amazing Well part of it part of what we deal with with these documents is we live in an era culturally when we are trained Teachers hand out a book in school and what do the teachers want from the students with respect to the book? Well read it but critique it That's how we read today We read with critique and so we go along and we kind of pass over things we agree with and then we find something We disagree with that we bring that out. That's our teaching method these documents come from the year when it was you know This is what you believe you want to learn physics read Aristotle. That's how you learn physics The world has changed so there's no reason we have these kinds of Experiences with these documents this way we just approach texts differently It brings up like what you know brings up kind of just like case you just stop and you look at it We have these today We are a church. We're on the church leadership team with elders and deacons and what are these us now and Your you know your background gives us a great context and it also helps to say well They're not in a lot of ways. They're not what they were then that's right And so what are they and I can my mind starts to try to categorize that I think of There they kind of teach us what the faith is So they're in one sense it introduces new Christians to what we believe and they're very well summarized They're very well ordered in Scripture. They help us just grow through our personal faith So that's another thing and then they They they function then within the classes level for in terms of a leadership bar or a boundary of some sort to say that we're This and then I also picked up from from I had some copies of a seminary publication where the professors Comment on the things in here and just give some reason I realize that it also kind of gets used these get used To be able to talk about issues of the day like like you brought up already so they become ways of saying well Okay, this new issue that comes along How do we engage that from our beliefs and so we try to anchor it in things that have been summarized from scripture? Those things just kind of come to mind is like wait. How are we as a church? How are we gonna? How do leaders expect to be using this to be thinking about this because it seems like there's two extremes one is This is us Out everyone who doesn't believe or can't sign on and then the other extreme is you know, that's just a formality, but really it's just about us and Jesus and and You know feeding the homeless Needs this so there's like these extremes, right? That's right. Yeah, I Find it comforting coming from a non-denominational Church background Early it always just the the comfort of knowing I'm not the first generation Ties to their heritage you know the Christian Church has two thousand years of heritage if there's no no mention of that No utilization of the tools from that feels like doing everything over again kind of like parents try to tell children Don't make the same mistakes. I made Something and they're all like I make my own mistakes It sort of feels like that being it being in non-denominational terms that choose not to know I mean either way that choose not to really access the ancient faith in any serious way though And so I feel strengthened by that by having some you know No temptation is overtaking it is a common demand when we look at this history We see that that our doubts that our fears that our arguments everything all of its been deal with in some sense before it's not New and we don't have to figure it out ourselves And you know every generation has stuff That the other Generations haven't figured out and so we have work to do too Well this can help us Because it might not be identical to what we're dealing with But they might have been enough commonality that we can just like you said I mean I want to make my own mistakes Well, we've been making mistakes for thousands of years how much time you got Yeah, how much time of your life do you want to spend making mistakes? That's right, so maybe you can learn from someone else's mistakes and stand on their shoulders It's really difficult for people like course stubborn like I was Way back when to to say learn from my mistakes. I said you know I'm not Teenagers I'm not gonna make those mistakes I'm not gonna learn from your mistakes. No I made my own Twice as bad and learned But not until I was well into adulthood You know and then it was really eye-opening It's it's really at what point in life you're at Did you learn this? Yeah And any other questions about anything you read I mean there's it's it's Jarring to go through them. I know if you've never been But but what's helpful is that you begin to realize you know like someone like myself or or Mark or mark or you know who grew up? That's probably just the three of us here who grew up in the Christian Form Church When you read these later on in life you begin to say oh Well, that's kind of why we're like we are Because they've shaped us and That's kind of the goal of this too that this shapes us so you have a frame of reference But it's hard when you brought up in a Christian Church And I I was brought up in a congregational church, which is a reformed church But the history was never brought to us Bible study was never brought to us and That's such an important part of learning about your religion and what you believe in is the Bible I Mean it's it's a pretty incredible thing when you stop and you say via this religion I Am in a sense Starting a conversation that goes all the way back to the beginning of human consciousness And I have a document I have documents that connect me with kind of the foundation of human civilization That's really helpful Yeah, at least have a place to start rather than someone who thinks well I was born in 1963 Then you just don't know what you don't know So this is all been very helpful and I I like hearing your approach to reading these But if we could talk a little bit about classes Expected there Well what what in particular What are you anxious about The rest of like chemistry Mystery No, no, it'll be way more boring than Well, actually the pastors often find it boring the laypeople who come off and find it interesting It's it's a lot of it is just a business meeting Where we're going to examine some candidates for different things And they're going to be examined kind of on some of this stuff in very broad strokes We don't open it up. It's like Article 7 the sufficiency of scripture in the Belgian confession We don't do that we ask them to tell their story and we just ask them broad strokes And so then they get examined classes this meeting we're going to make some decisions Just about a bunch of things that might seem random and so when you get the the agenda you can kind of read through it and It's just basically keeping the church going it's a bigger section of probably what your local leadership team meeting does You know this is our March meeting so we don't pass a budget this meeting we're going to decide on delegates that go to Senate We're going to approve some candidates. There's a minister There's a minister in a church that Feels burned out and wants to step away from the ministry right now and Part of how that works is that I'm a minister, but I'm accountable to these groups and so I can't just say I'm done No his council has to communicate with classes, and then there are Synodical deputies who come and so we're going to talk about that and we're going to hear He's you know he's he's just kind of feeling burned out. He needs to take a step away How can we figure out what the next what does he want to do next and how can we all agree on that together? And so most of us in the room don't know what's going on, but we listen to those who are close And we say okay that sounds right good, so it's the way we as a community Maintain our bonds together So what happens is we come in? Get food and coffee. There's about 60 50 or 60 people there 80 now 80 We do a town worship where we do songs Where are we doing it? We're doing it first ribbon There's so be in the sanctuary. Yeah, we'll do songs And then we'll file into another room Where there will be long tables like this or round tables About six or eight people around and you'll be sitting with city life people and another church like two or three people from another church or two And they'll go through the agenda The first thing you do is walk up to the front and sign the form of the church And you won't have to because you're not a church yet The next meeting six months later six months later you have to sign or whoever we send yeah but one of the things on the agenda is does classes agree that your church will go from being emerging to established and Classes will say You think you're ready. What does Livingstone say Livingstone says yeah? We think they're ready and do you like have a budget and you're covering things you got enough people you say yeah We're ready But you know what's nice is it this March in a month I know we can have two weeks March 6, and you you're the two that I think you guys become her coming along It's it's the one where you get to just see how it goes without nobody's gonna be like Hilda Katie you guys are just Yeah, so just sit there and smile and you get a watch the thing Earlier that if you don't sign on you can't participate yes, that's when you're a delegate yeah for both And yeah, this meeting they're gonna say yeah We say it's okay for this church to become organized and so then we've got our installation of elders and deacons deacon service plan So that then a lot of elders and deacons that can get sent to the next class so Right oh yes the basic and everyone who signs there Has normally already signed at their local level That there's also a thing that we didn't talk about which is called gravamen which basically is if you read through this And there's a point in here. That's a real a real bone of contention and often a Common one today is infant baptism Because there's a lot of Christians who will come so let's say from a Baptist tradition, and they'll say I just
