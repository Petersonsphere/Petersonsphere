 Just a quick note that here in Sacramento we have our sixth Jordan Peterson meetup. This is a picture taken at a couple, one a couple times ago. We've got, oh, Bucco the lobster fell down. Bucco is our mascot and we get together, well last month we got together twice. We'll talk, I'll talk to the June tonight, the meeting tonight and maybe we'll get together. Bucco needs a little bit of air. We'll get together and our meetups are just freewheeling conversations. We talk for two hours straight and then I close the time and then people can stay longer and talk some more, usually in small groups. And we just talk, talk, talk. We have a great time. It's a great meetup. So if you're in Sacramento, join us. Sacramento Jordan Peterson meetup, meeting six at Livingstone's Church. It's on the website and right now it says 13 people going. I never know how many are actually going to show up, but that's going on tonight. So if you can make it, love to see you.
