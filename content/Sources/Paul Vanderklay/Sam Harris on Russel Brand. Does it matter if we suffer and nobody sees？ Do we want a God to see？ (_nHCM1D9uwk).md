 Hi, this is Paul didn't have time for a long video today. Just had other things I have to do for my day job So another little short I've been a Twitter friend pointed me to the Russell Brand Sam Harris interview Which I thought was incredibly Helpful Dave Rubin tends to be a very Accommodating interviewer. He doesn't he doesn't tend to push real hard He's very gentle and there's there's something there's something to be said for that kind of interview Russell Brand is Russell Brand and he does he does his own thing and he gets in there and he and he and he says what He wants and he's he's fun to listen to and he pushed Sam Harris quite a bit more in terms of a number of things And so I I think that episode between them was was really quite terrific and I've listened to it twice now I'm gonna listen to it a third time. I'll probably be taking elements from that and elements from the from the Dave Rubin Interview of Sam Harris to when I when I finally am able to construct the longer video One of the things that I was pondering on last night to was was the relationship between Sam Harris and Epicurus Sam Harris is always looking for Some non Christian roots and a commenter made the point that you know, why stop at Christianity? Why go before and how can we how can we connect some of these individuals to Christianity? And is that fair? That's a fair that's a fair question and I think a valid conversation and so if you're looking for a a pagan Philosopher long before Christianity you could look at Epicurus and there's a fun little video on school of life about Epicurus that you can watch It's only about it's only about five minutes and it's worth watching and it'll probably give you some real things to think about in terms of Sam Harris and what he stands for now one of the things that's that comes up quite a bit in the in both Sam Harris's interviews is that he often says that that consciousness is the only thing that matters and That makes sense. And so one of the things I'm looking at in the video the longer video making often when I make a video I sit down for maybe an hour or two and I hammer out the I Hammer out the PowerPoint which kind of gives me the structure of the argument and then I sit down and I record the video That's what I usually do I'm about my fourth draft of my PowerPoint on this longer Sam Harris Jordan Peterson religion piece each time I get a little ways into it and then I don't have time to actually record the video because of other things just in my life So then I think about it more and then I rework it I don't have the final draft of that PowerPoint yet. I might be able to do it tomorrow It looks like I'll have a little bit of time probably tomorrow. So I'm still working on that but but Sam Harris So if you look at the Jordan Peterson Susan Blackmore Unbelievable interview Blackmore keeps saying Sam Harris is all about consciousness and taking consciousness seriously and and seeing this I can very much see the point that she was making Sam Harris is all about consciousness But I think his approach to consciousness and the way he approaches consciousness as a materialist is very interesting I'm talking fast because I want to keep this video short It's very interesting because for example when he appeals to let's say Buddhism and certain forms of Hinduism and And says well, that's that's kind of like this I think no that's not at all like this because when you approach this as a materialist you approach this in a very different way Than let's say an ancient Buddhist or an ancient Hindu or even a contemporary Buddhist and a contemporary Hindu for whom the universe is Well, we'll have to get into that because this gets into all of these ways in which multiple layers of the universe are or not Connected and the hierarchies in a sense we have them in which are foundational and which are expressions of them So on and so forth again, I got to be careful. This is gonna get long I'm just gonna play this little portion of their conversation because I think it's illuminating in terms of Whether Sam Harris can actually pull this off. So let's jump into a little bit of this of this interview But if you look at the history of Christianity and Judaism and Islam you find people who I mean these are explicitly dualistic traditions You have a soul you have a soul that exists in relationship to the divine and and that division Is maintained I would say Sam Harris that the reason that bifurcation occurred is precisely because Were man's relationship with the divine Prioritized in the manner that you've just been describing that seems a neurologically Apposite were that to become our priority a materialistic let's call it lifestyle a Mechanistic social social systems such as the ones that we inhabit would be less Fertile because if people believed that the ultimate reality was not being experienced by the self that there was no self The that unbinds us that makes oneness a real possibility that starts to suggest that your consciousness and my consciousness Ultimately are the same or at least there's nothing to suggest that they're any different and that the things that we believe to be different a superficial Accents acquired through culture Now that's very much That's very much Russell Brand's idea And this is obviously a place that Russell Brand and Sam Harris are going to disagree on pretty dramatically But it's it's right here in these questions of materiality consciousness so on and so forth Russell Brand seems to be Seems to be promoting much more of a new age type of thing. I Think I would love to sit down with these two and every time someone said spirituality just stop them and say, okay What do you mean by that word? Really? Let's talk about that because you Even in my own Christian ministry when I hear people say spiritual I want to stop them and say we have to talk about that word before we can go any further because this word is basically acting like that thin layer of water on ice that lets the skate go above it and We're not all on the same page about what that word means anyway now same Harris's argument response, which is very interesting Okay, but that's also true materially and we shouldn't give the material short shrift because the material progress is the thing that frees attention to I mean, so I mean just you roll back the clock long enough you find people living in just Perpetual states of trying not to die, right? I mean like you're fending off You're exposed to the elements your your your suffering the consequences of disease and you have no concept of what disease is, right? You don't know about the germ theory of disease and your child dies and you think it's because they your neighbor Shine the evil eye on the child, right? I mean, so it's like it's you have magical beliefs accounting for changes in the world and They're they're completely fallacious, right? So the progress we've made in understanding the the material world is all to the good Except we have all of these misaligned incentive problems and externalized damages to to very good things I mean like you want an iPhone, right? But you don't want people jumping off the roof of Foxconn because life is such as so painful there been to make an iPhone, right? So is it possible to make an iPhone without Creating just unendurable misery for some number of people undoubtedly it must be true, right? We haven't we haven't figured it out yet So as to make that the default and We need to do that but we you know, there's not There is no there is no distance between the material and the spiritual here I mean so because if consciousness is What do you mean by spiritual? just a matter of information processing in in The right complex systems and if consciousness could one day be born in our computers, right? Well, then we'll have an ethical obligation to to not make our computers suffer, right if Siri could suffer, right? Well, then it matters how you talk to her, you know, and it would matter every used it for stupid Questions I was a bloke actually. Oh, yeah And We're obviously not there yet or it certainly seems obvious that we're not there yet. But at a certain point We will very likely Either be in the presence of conscious machines or think we are right will lose sight of though. They'll they'll emulate conscious systems Competing a compelling enough way that our default will be I'm in relationship to this thing now and and to withdraw a sense of consciousness in that case would seem Just unprincipled and unethical and we'll have we could well build machines that Seem to have emotional lives and even have more richer emotional lives than we do because they're gonna have access to all of human knowledge all of human all of the aesthetic products of Human ingenuity for all of history and they'll be able to talk about them and appreciate them and remind you of how much you love certain things and and react to your emotion Faster and more accurately than your best friends or your or your spouse, right? We could build ultimately we will very likely build these machines and if we haven't understood how consciousness arises in physical systems we'll think they're conscious and we will maybe right or wrong about that and and Whether we're right or wrong about that will be a huge consequence because huge moral consequence, you know, it would be it would be It would be an absolutely abhorrent act to build Conscious systems that can suffer in ways we don't even understand. Yes, and just just a cavalierly You know spawn this off in simulations and you know on you know The Amazon cloud and not know what the hell we're doing for me though, of course We've already created like that. This is not just a hypothesis because already all around us as we've already fleetingly discussed lie scattered They're damaged and broken and presumably conscious entities that our fellow human beings are human beings farm animals dogs and we're gonna get into Sam Harris doesn't like the word religion and so I'm gonna use philosophy of life in my big video because okay We won't talk about religion talk philosophy of life Is that a is that are those words you can object to are those words that we can take the? ideas of the Christian and the ideas of the Muslim and the ideas of the Jew and the ideas of the Buddhist and the ideas of The Hindu and the ideas of the atheist and the ideas of of the New Age people and all of those can we all say? They have a philosophy of life if we if we're gonna segregate religion over to the side Okay, is that one way we're gonna get we're gonna get beyond the The the problem of the of the religious talk But now what happens in in Sam Harris is that this consciousness and the happiness or or suffering that happens in this consciousness now becomes the criteria by which the entire moral system is evaluated now I would argue that Sam Harris is basically Explaining and articulating the philosophy of life of what Robert Bella called expressive individualism Sheila ism if you will I've got Habits of the heart right up there on the on the bookshelf habits of the heart a book that was quite popular in the 80s Well, my whole show is bringing back books that I read and in college in the 80s Where is amusing ourselves to death? Anyway, I got to keep this short. I don't want to ramble too much I don't even have that much time. So Here's a question if a child suffers in the forest and nobody sees her did she suffer Can you answer that question? because Harris begins by saying well, you know this this whole business about having a relationship with this man in the sky or something like this You know, that's that's all just that shall just woo or or that's that's nothing That's nothing but what's really matters is consciousness and now he's talking about consciousness and machines and and that leads me to ask the question Okay. Well, let's say I do this Here is despair Is my computer suffering is? The is the jiffy Oh jiffy-jiffy. Oh, I said it. Oh my goodness Where's that gonna go in the comment section is the computer suffering? Are these people suffering are the actors suffering? Are we suffering and not knowing it a lot of people have been bringing up Kierkegaard and the existentialists in this What what does it what does it mean for a computer to suffer? What does what about despair? reread Kierkegaard sickness unto death, which is which is all about despair, so Am I making the computer suffer and by closing this page well actually they're all gifs so Okay, so maybe the server isn't suffering anymore, but maybe the Maybe the the code that is running in my browser is suffering look at the suffering that I'm doing well That's I'm gonna do more Am I am I committing the moral injustice here we go crying crying There she is Too sad to work too sad to walk Is my computer suffering how would I know what is suffering now this gets How do I know if it's suffering in a sense we're kind of back to if you look at Peterson and Delahunty and his relationship with his lawnmower and Peterson jokes at him like You know we should we could really talk about this more and Peterson was not Unserious when he made that comment to Delahunty in their conversations and and so then now in many ways We're back to Sheldrake watch Rupert Sheldrake and Russell Brand's Conversation and I know a lot of people like well Sheldrake he's just but the questions he's raising does the Sun suffer the Sun has more Biochemical connections than your brain does well, how would we know if the Sun is suffering? Well, how do we know how if we talk about plants suffering and many of us would say well plants do seem to suffer because they do Seem to thrive well well what about gems and what about I mean this gets woo-woo very very quickly And in a sense we're back to the monarchy the materialist perspective requires an imagination of the monarchical vision this this objective order that we can imagine usually by taking out the fourth dimension which is time and But then viewing it through eyes that no individual has because all of us are viewing it subjectively So in a sense we do so in our imagination and our imagination creates this this objective this this Objective order and so if I imagine this tree falling in the forest Well, I imagine a tree falling in the forest without sound I Can picture it in my mind in a sense easier than I can hear it in my mind. So Where does all of this go and and does then the universe of potentially of potentially happy or suffering? consciousnesses require a monarchical vision of pathos This there is there is there not only what you can see very quickly is this gets relational fast Now So Sam Harris is a materialist and he's reducing all of this to matter and energy and so Consciousness is a product of matter and energy. So so do atoms feel and actually earlier in this thing He said, you know, we don't know if cells feel we don't know if cells suffer We might very well make an argument that they suffer or are we projecting upon them? But given a naturalist materialist perspective does concern for conscious suffering really make any more sense Than a romantic projection of suffering on a felled tree a picked apple a cut stone Isn't it all just rearrangement of matter and energy In other words does my chair suffer when I push it across the room is the air suffering as this fan is blowing on Me in the hot Sacramento summer Who cares? Does it matter? Well suddenly? If there is in fact a monarchical observer well who can who can actually have the wisdom and perspective to adjudicate suffering because very quickly the You know the the limousine liberal comes and says to the to the to the city who wants to build a homeless camp in their Ritzy neighborhood or demand that there be affordable housing there It pains me to see those poor people. I would rather have them shielded off in a different neighborhood Okay, you're pained by seeing them they're pained by who knows what well Let's give them computer games and dust them up with Cheetos and and give them cocaine until they die it in a sense makes More sense to to give them cocaine until they die rather than making them live through this whole thing So we're going to have to ask about well suffering and and how does how does suffering relate to normal life and accomplishment? You know maybe we should stop the Olympics and and call the marathon a Terrible suffering ordeal because all those marathoners look at the look on their face They're suffering or maybe we should ban childbirth without Medicines that kill the pain this after this whole movement of natural childbirth This thing doesn't end in a sense if you enter into this perspective of making suffering and Peterson does this to a certain degree Making suffering the central coin of the drama of the universe That has to be thought through as much as all of the other Competitors for central coinage of the universe So there's a short video We're looking at 18 minutes And again, I do a short video because I don't have time for a long one today and my long one isn't ready And I know some of you like short videos. So here it is
