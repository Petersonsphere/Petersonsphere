 Hi, this is Paul. I want to begin this video with a little something that I wrote that some of you aren't going to like very much. You have to listen to it within the context of everything I'm about to say over how many hours of video. I think what marriage equality means in the context of the United States, in the legal, moral, imaginary context of the United States, marriage equality is essential because it is a societal statement of affirmation of the value of same-sex attracted individuals. They are no longer second-class citizens. This is a powerful argument and I think it's probably legally true and I think it's at the heart of the Supreme Court decision now in 2013. Now, I have a lot of reservations about whether the Supreme Court should have done such because, as I mentioned in previous videos, when the Supreme Court does something like this, sort of like Roe vs Wade, it has both a way of resolving a fight and also perpetuating a fight. And so in these videos where I'm talking about the Bible and same-sex marriage, I think this dynamic needs to be kept in mind and I think this statement is legally true and it's a powerful argument and it's something that doesn't answer the question about the church and same-sex marriage. That's a little different question. Now, this reality complicates the church and same-sex marriage considerably, but as you're going to find throughout these videos, I have a lot of ideas about this and they're fairly nuanced and a good number of them make neither side happy. So, as you watch me work through my own thoughts on this subject, there are going to be times when I upset one side and make the other side cheer and vice versa and I expect that to happen. But I wanted to start this video with this idea that marriage equality is essential because it is a societal statement of affirmation of the value of same-sex attracted individuals. They are no longer second class citizens. That's a powerful argument. Now, it's an argument because we live in a legal, moral, imaginary that is very pervasive and very strong and through the course of this video, I'm going to talk about this with respect to the Mosaic Code and how we got here. In Portal, I think it was 35 where Eric Weinstein talked with Ross Douthat, he made a statement. Douthat was talking about the fact that the posture on baby making has changed in the last number of years. That people who were quite dismissive about procreation are a little less so and Eric used some language and this is part of, I know some of you are not Eric fans and you certainly tell me on Twitter and in the comments section and sometimes in emails, but part of Eric's gift and I think contribution is that he has a way of words sometimes where he says something and I think, yeah, I was trying to get at that idea and he just put it into some words and now it's clear and he did that in minute 45 of that conversation but not about what he was talking about but rather about the subject of same-sex marriage. The dynamism about these extreme viewpoints is dimming. They're still uninhabited but none of these things still work. Now this isn't true of both sides of this conversation but it is true of the conservative position that the dynamism about it is dimming and all positions are inhabited but there's a sense that none of these things still work and in my opinion there's a sense in which the gay rights movement has triumphed in a way that even those who do not think same-sex marriage should be legal in the United States or any place for that matter do not think that the church that affirms same-sex marriage but there's a sense in which the conservatives and you hear this when you listen to Ben Shapiro argue and of course Ben Shapiro loves to argue and he argues very sharply but you know even Ben Shapiro has a nuanced view of this subject and of course Ben Shapiro's a pretty conservative guy and and I really saw this when Peter Thiel was at Socrates in the city with Eric Metaxas. Now Eric Metaxas his credentials in terms of a culture warrior not a social justice culture warrior but the conservative culture warrior his credentials are pretty solid and what was interesting to me about that entire debate was you have gay married Peter Thiel chatting with Eric Metaxas and it doesn't even come up and and Eric wants Peter to claim his Christianity more boldly as a same-sex married man. I think that's a demonstration of the dimming dynamism of the conservative position on this. Now I don't necessarily celebrate that and that will tell you just how conflicted I am about this topic because while I am happy that Peter Thiel doesn't need to be in the closet to engage in a conversation with Eric Metaxas in public I'm not sure about the deep implications over multiple generations that this change will bring to the culture and I think we're already seeing signs of it and the signs are deeply troubling and so again I am going to say a lot of stuff in these videos that are going to annoy and sometimes anger both sides but I'm prepared for that because I've done some thinking about this and a lot of the nuance that I possess is founded in a lot of struggling over this issue and how I think about it. As a culture we need to figure out how to use a closet and this is part of my point about Peter Thiel being able to be just a normal person in an interview as a gay man. I think it's better that way than necessarily playing a lot of games. I feel the same I feel the same way about racists. Because of when and where and how I grew up I've got really strong feelings about racism. Also because I'm white I've had the experience of white people saying very racist things about black folks in front of me thinking there'd be no problem because of my white skin. What has generally happened is a lot of those racists have gone in the closet and if you read Warmth of Other Suns which is a wonderful book about the migration of African-Americans up from the Jim Crow South into California and New Jersey and Grand Rapids and many places that I've lived, you know one of the comments about California was you know they left Jim Crow but they met his brother James and part of what you begin to recognize in that places like California where everybody's just gonna be chill and cool and zen is that you know racism can kind of go underground and part of my New Jersey temperament I would rather if someone thinks I'm a jerk just tell me I think you're a jerk I can handle that I don't have a problem with that you think I'm a jerk fine but but it's kind of some of the duplicity I find more problematic. Now having said that I don't think that necessarily closeted identities or issues or ideas are necessarily always bad things not everything deserves to be out in public there is a role for privacy so it needs to be a lot of nuance here but but again the main point of this slide that I have up right now if you're watching the YouTube is there's some dimming dynamism on the conservative side and I think partly because of the way that the transgender issues have just fractured the imagined LGBTQIA coalition that there might be some dimming dynamism on the other side as well. Now as the series is about it's about a confessional conversation and in many ways you know you might say boy there's a long time between the last video and this one well it's not unusual for my channel but I'm very conflicted about making these videos because I'm very conflicted about this issue because I'm not that high in disagreeableness and I don't necessarily like randomly picking fights with people and I don't like necessarily being at odds with people but this is a classic wedge issue and increasingly so to the point now where you know unless you're unless you're an affirming church you're a bigoted church and and that came through with the first same-sex marriage and the sex lives of the patriarchs I was right off the bat some of those comments started and you know you're just you're just hiding your bigotry with the Bible okay you know my mind that much how many how many hours of video are you willing to listen to but it's something that I think needs to be looked at and talked about for myself I use these videos as in a weird way sort of uncloseted therapy to talk through things and you know who knew that YouTube could be such a really such a helpful thing with that because I put things out there and I get feedback in the comments section and the discord and conversations that's been one of the most amazing things to learn about the power of social media that when done well can be especially if you don't get too much status so you can still have time to read the comment section there aren't too many of them but but I've gained and benefited tremendously from the feedback from from so many of you so you know thank you but it's something so I have to work through it for myself for my church for my friends every generation has questions and conflicts that that they must not avoid but sometimes desperately want to and in most cases not were in most cases the working out of these conflicts are not unmitigated triumphs or successes in anyway I was listening to Adam and sitch the beginning of them talk a little bit about their quine Stein and the the Veritas guy forget his name and and and sitch had an idea of a you know a superposition is something that it's it's neither side of the position but it's kind of a hegelian antithesis of it and and you know perhaps I want to develop a super a superposition about this subject because I'm not really happy with the items on the menu this of course started when I was participating in the nuance forum which is exactly what this kind of thing is for a new lunch form conversation where someone who watches my videos had a question for me and this person said that he was raised Catholic and his sister came out as gay to his parents and it didn't go well and then there was a vote on same-sex marriage in their state was obviously before 2013 and the mother was torn their social pressure in the church to vote no against same-sex marriage but she loves her daughter and she thought maybe you know if her daughter could maybe be better if her daughter were married than just having a series of partners and so she was conflicted she didn't know what to do I could completely understand that I can respect that respect that conflict and I respect someone being honest about being conflicted in something like that and so and so the the person processed a little bit with me you know the Bible had it's a lot of rules in it that we don't believe in and a lot of these are in the Mosaic Code which we'll get into we no longer think that there's anything wrong with being gay or other areas of sexual ethics it's not really an argument it's more an observation a church should catch up with the times and support gay people okay there's so much packed into that idea Paul what do you think I kind of said how many hours do you want to listen to me well if you listen to all the videos then you'll kind of know so I began with the patriarchs and I did that on purpose I didn't begin with creation at some point the creation stories will have to be dealt with because in some ways those are the most powerful and significant of any of the text of the Bible a lot of you'll see as we go through I began with the patriarchs the patriarchs lived in a culture where the moral imaginary was did not have an imperial or a monarchical legal enforcement what on earth do I mean by those fancy words Abram is told to leave the Mesopotamia these places where these city-states grow and become dynamic large powerful sophisticated first world empires and he's told to go to Canaan what is Canaan so you have Mesopotamia up here you have Egypt down here and Canaan is the land in the middle and Canaan is perpetually the place that when empires can get their act together they dominate Canaan is by definition if you if you listen to Jonathan Peugeot is by definition a fringe place it's not full-blown wilderness we'll get to talk about that when we get into Exodus but it's a fringe place and what there is in Canaan to the best that we can find is that there are you know sort of city-states and tribal peoples who are who are there and these are small these little city-state things these little cities are small and they're called cities in the Old Testament and by virtue of the Sunday school books we have we have these monstrous things that I think often look something more like medieval feudal Europe but the populations of these cities archaeologically speaking are really quite tiny and they're probably they're probably sort of little tribal groups family kin a little bit larger you know really the size of a small church in some ways and and some hangers-on and slaves and servants and that's what you're finding and this is the place where Abraham goes now somebody made in the discord conversation last week a point about me and the Dunbar number the Dunbar number is the number of people with whom an individual can actually have a face-to-face relationship and that numbers between 1 and 200 and they made the observation that that's a big deal for me and it is because in many ways that defines the the majority church now majority church is not necessarily the church that a majority people go to but the majority of churches in North America are are are so are our Dunbar shaped numbers and there's a reason for that because churches become family groupings as such especially in a country where in certain places like California where where people move and migrate to from other places of the country and so the church sort of becomes a substitute family so Abraham leaves these first world dominant civilizations in Mesopotamia and goes out to this fringe area of Canaan and that's where he's going to live and God's going to live give him land and make him a great nation but none of those things come true anywhere even close to Abrams lifetime now why do I mention this in this conversation about same-sex marriage in the Bible in the sex lives of the patriarchs because in Genesis the cultural norms are enforced communally and culturally but not legally and by the sword and that's very important and probably the best illustration of that is this case study in Genesis 34 about the rape of Dinah so Dinah the daughter of Leah had born to Jacob went out to visit the women of the land when they were living near Shechem when Shechem son of Hamor even noticed the way these towns are named they're named after individuals these are these are small little you know villages really some of them have walls for protection because it's Canaan is sort of the Wild West so when Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite and again these are clan names the ruler of that area and so you kind of have a strong man a local tribal strong man saw her he took her and raped her now I hear a lot of carping from celebrity or would-be celebrity atheists that the Mosaic Code basically says if you rape a girl you get to marry her it's not entirely true and again we're what we're doing in this video is we're working up towards what I call the Mosaic moral imaginary so here you have this case in the book of Genesis where Dinah Jacob and his extended family group is living in an area near another family group and Dinah goes and is you know relating to the women of the land which meant the women of the community going to the well or doing whatnot probably has some friends she's a young woman not married probably just a teenager and Shechem the son of the strong man sees her likes her wants her takes her son of mine just started watching Game of Thrones something that I haven't watched before and I saw a couple of episodes I was struck in Game of Thrones at and these are in some of these episodes about the brutality and thinking that's probably you know the kind of brutality you would see in the ancient world as described here you have a strong man and the son of the strong man and he sees a woman that he wants or a young girl that he wants and he takes her and he rapes her his heart was drawn to Dinah the daughter of Jacob he loved the young woman and spoke tenderly to her and Shechem said to his father Hamor get me this girl is my wife and again this is this is how things were done he noticed Dinah hasn't not a word about what she's thought about anything here and again that's part of the era here but look at how now get you get a sense of everybody knows that wrong has been done but but there's not a legal framework that's governing here okay and and so what you have are two rather powerful clans and now there's a disagreement between them and we're going to see how the clan of Jacob remember who Jacob is deals with the clan of Shechem and Hamor when Jacob heard that his daughter Dinah had been defiled his sons were in the field with his livestock so he did nothing about it until they came home because he understood you know if you're going to make a claim there's no justice there's no judge there's there's no king in the land necessarily this is going to be a negotiation where the amount of power that you have raw power in terms of men with swords and capable of fighting is probably going to determine the outcome so so Jacob not a you know very shrewd man here's about this and gonna sit on it a little bit because the boys and the servants are all out with the livestock and he's gonna make a claim he's gonna need to back it up when Shechem's father Hamor went out to talk to Jacob meanwhile Jacob sons had come in from the fields as soon as they heard what happened they were shocked and furious because Shechem had done an outrageous thing in Israel pay attention to that by sleeping with Jacob's daughter a thing that should not have been done in other words everybody understood what is right and wrong it's there culturally but it's illegal and it legal and illegal is not really the question they're not living under this legal imaginary that most of us for generations and generations have simply assumed now not every place in the world and not every time in the world of obviously but now but people have to be careful here because well bloods gonna be shed Hamar said to them my son Shechem has his heart set on your daughter please give her to him as a wife intermarry with us ah join clans intermarry with us give us your daughters and take our daughters for yourself you can settle among us the land is open to you live in it trade in it and acquire property in it now we should get a sense of how wealthy and powerful Jacob is and what it means to be that if you watch Westerns for example you know a common trope in Westerns is that you know all the way to remember Patrick Swayze's Roadhouse you know the same kind of situation if the law isn't real stable wealthy and powerful men who have men's with shotguns and pickup trucks can sort of get their way if the law is too underpowered and and it's important to remember earlier in the book of Genesis where there's a raid by a king and again now when we think kings we think huge kingdoms well kings are probably sort of like tribal chieftains when when someone raided Sodom and carried off law and his family and Abram hears about it he calls his servants in and a whole bunch of other kings got raided on Abram goes and cleans their clock him and his you know doesn't have a lot of sons but it's got a whole lot of slaves and servants and basically you know Abram's kind of his own little tribal chieftain and he's got enough to take on these kings and to win and so you know Jacob has to mind his P's and Q's but so does Hamar and Hamar says well let's turn this kind of potentially difficult situation into a win-win and let's join clans there's plenty of land and together we can be stronger but you know in a Game of Thrones type way well okay who's really how's this gonna work I mean just just read history then Shechem said to Dinah's father and brothers notice notice the brothers father and brothers notice the circumlocution now we're gonna kind of get around Jacob now the emphasis is gonna be somewhere else let me find favor in your eyes and I will give whatever you ask make the price of the bride and the gift I am to bring you as great as you like and I'll pay whatever you ask only give me the young woman as my wife Shechem is smitten whatever you want I'll give it careful what you ask for because their sister Dinah had been defiled they Jacob's sons replied deceitfully as they spoke to Shechem and his father Hamor they said we can't do such a thing we can't give you we can't give our sister to a man who's not circumcised yet let's use this what today we might look at as a religious thing as an excuse a manipulative excuse to as we'll see get away with something that would be a disgrace to us we will enter into an agreement with you on one condition only that you become like us by circumcising all your males then they will give then we will give you our daughters and take our daughters for ourselves we will settle among you and become one people with you but if you will not agree to be circumcised we'll take our sister and go driving a hard bargain no anesthesia you got some flint knives and a very sensitive part of the body and Shechem and Hamar are gonna have to do some of their own politicking here their proposal seems good to Hamar and his son Shechem the young man who was most honored of all his father's family lost no time in doing what they said because he was delighted with Jacob's daughter he's smitten in love now pay attention in the back of the mind here you have Jacob falling in love with Rachel and Laban and his trickery remember Dinah is the daughter of Leah there's stuff going on in the background here multi-generational it's very common for the Bible so Hamar and his son Shechem went to the gate of their city to speak to the men of their city these men are friendly towards us they said let them live in our land and trade in it the land is plenty of room for them we will marry their daughters and they will marry ours but the men will agree to live with us as one people only on the condition that our males be circumcised as they themselves are won't their livestock their property and all of their animals become ours a little bit of motivation here Jacob and his family are powerful and wealthy together they could perhaps dominate the land become wealthy life would be good for everything yeah a little pain in the moment but good over the long run all the men who went and who went out of the city gate agreed with Hamar and his son Shechem and every male in the city was circumcised now against city we have these visions of huge amounts but you know this could be you know a grouping of 50 a hundred hundred fifty two hundred all face-to-face relationships all of the people the people so all the men said okay well we'll do this three days later while all of them were still in pain two of Jacob's sons Simeon and Levi Dina's brothers remember now okay now we're highlighting not only the rift between Jacob and Shechem or Hamor but we're highlighting the rift between Leah and Rachel so the full brothers of Dina so blood counts Dina's brothers took their swords and attacked the unsuspecting city killing every male this might look like Game of Thrones now they put Hamor and his sons and his son Shechem to the sword and took Dina from Shechem's house and left he had kept her okay he wasn't gonna wait again does that remind you of Jacob and in Laban's house although of course Jacob didn't rape Rachel or Leah different circumstance but the Bible these hyperlinks as Jordan Peterson calls them these these shadows and these memories just lurk in these stories the sons of Jacob came the sons of Jacob came upon the dead bodies and looted the city so so Simeon and Levi go in there and kill everybody while they're still sore and not able to fight real well and then the rest of the brothers get there and well they kind of size up the situation but hey let's go in and you know take what we want so the sons of Jacob came upon the dead bodies and looted the city where their sister had been defiled and they seized their flocks and herds and donkeys and everything else of theirs in the city and out in the fields and they carried off all their wealth and all their women and children taking as plunder everything in the houses and again you know very Game of Thrones ish you know you win the war did the victor go the spoils kill the men take the women and children and all the stuff and that's that's how life worked in that time for most of human history then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi you have brought trouble on me by making me obnoxious to the Canaanites and the Parasites the people living in this land we are few in number and if they join forces against me and attack me I and my household will be destroyed okay again why am I telling this story in this context before we get to the Mosaic law there's sort of morality out there and there's a there's a code about how life should be lived but there's no Emperor or King that perhaps distant relatives of Hamor and Shechem can say hey wait a minute so in other words if you're gonna kill someone off kill them off completely you know do genocide don't leave any family around who can one day come up and seek revenge a name is a nego Montoya you killed my father prepared to die you don't want to leave any loose ends you kill them all and everybody understood that that's sort of what you do but Jacob says hey wait a minute you know if if we go camping someplace else and other people hear about this they might all get together what does that say well the Canaanites and the Parasites and these people all by themselves probably can't take us on but if they gang up they can and that's sort of again it's it's the Wild West here and there really isn't a law there's just sort of moral customs about but they replied should we have treated our should he has to have treated our our sister like a prostitute in other words again there was there was no sheriff to report the rape to it was the community you know it's up to brothers to defend their sister's honor then God said to Jacob go up to Bethel and settle there and build an altar there to God who appeared to you when you were fleeing from your brother Esau so Jacob said to his household and all who were with him get rid of the foreign gods you probably took some from the city and purify yourselves and change your clothing because of all of the evil that you've done then come let us go up to Bethel where I will build an altar to God who answered me in the day of my distress and who has been with me wherever I've gone so they gave us so they gave Jacob all the foreign gods they had and the rings in their ears and Jacob buried them under the oak at Shechem now there's a lot of steep stuff going there in terms of they're putting all this behind them and and there's something of a there's something of a repentance offering going on right here in this little part of the story then they set out and the terror of God fell on the towns around them so that no one pursued them so in other words they who do you deal with well today we use words like what goes around comes around and karma and all of this stuff and those ideas aren't aren't aren't necessarily so alien there but of course it's God it's not the meta it's not the meta divine realm or the fates or anything like that it's God that God okay they they're repenting of what they did to Shechem and Hamor and they basically made the guilt offering and left all those foreign gods and the gold there and so everyone else was afraid of them now again those of you who are a little allergic to supernaturality might say yeah they're afraid of them look what they did to that other town yeah that's a part of it too but the point here again is that Canaan is this Wild West and Abram leaves these large cities in Mesopotamia where there would be a king and where people might go to the king and present to the king their complaints Jacob could have gone to the king and said hey my daughter Dinah was with the women and Shechem son of Hazor raped her I want restitution and a third party would do justice in the land according to a set of laws okay but we're not there with the patriarchs we're in the Wild West and so this story sort of illustrates that you don't you have sort of moral custom but you don't really have law in the land so Abram leaves the Fertile Crescent where powerful imperial nation states govern to into a liminal space where empires extend only when they achieve self dominance Joseph now at the end of the book of Genesis as sort of a proto Christ figure goes from slave to near imperial monarch in one of the biggest most perennial empires that was in their world which was Egypt I mean you had Babylon and Nineveh and these other you know states up up there in the north but Egypt is always Egypt and this is part of the reason that Egypt is so emblematic of Empire throughout the Bible even when you read the book of Revelation where you've got Babylon well Babylon sort of a stand-in for Rome Babylon of course who destroyed the temple Rome destroyed the temple Egypt there's a lot of echoes of Exodus and Egypt in the book of Revelation too and it was so Egypt kind of becomes the name of Empire and and Joseph is sold into slavery by his brothers and of course here's this Rembrandt issue of Potiphar's wife it's it's interesting that the Sunday School materials always make Potiphar's wife look a good bit more attractive than Rembrandt made her but anyway Joseph goes from slave all the way up he sees the future and and all the way up and becomes second only to Pharaoh in terms of the Empire of Egypt and so there's a very big shift in the story and this helps us see what Genesis is Genesis is covenant prologue now you'll see covenants emerge in the book of Genesis where where Abram cuts a covenant with the Lord and it's that's usually the language of language is cut you have this this scene and in the book of Genesis where the animals are cut in half and and usually two parties would walk through the halves of the animal in a sense saying if I fail to keep my end of the deal may I be like these animals that are cut in half but only the smoking fire pot goes through the middle and so the Lord in a sense takes on the covenant and says no I will I will make this covenant and this this happens with with Jacob of course because the Lord makes all these promises to Jacob at Bethel in a dream it's before chapter 35 here when I read and Jacob way Jacob turns yes into a negotiation says if you give me what you said you're going to give me I'll give you 10% and Jacob it wasn't conditional when he gave it you just can't trust him and that's the whole point of the Abraham stories and the Jacob stories that they can't trust God they don't trust God and and Jacob is someone who is is going to want to always negotiate his way and and so this question of trust is again part of something that's lurking under the story in chapter 34 and 35 of Genesis but Genesis is a covenant prologue chapters 1 through 11 sort of map the world and chapters 12 through 50 set the stage for Israel as God's people and Abraham we first meet him at the end of chapter 11 and he goes then into chapter 12 Abraham is this key transitional figure between the old and the new and we're going from Empire to Dunbar number communities and in a semi wilderness that's where Abraham goes and with Joseph we go back from the wilderness back into Empire okay that's what's happening in Genesis now you get into Exodus and you get the birth of a people you get a tyrannical and genocidal Empire you go from a tyrannical genocidal powerful Empire into the wilderness towards a promised land but remember Canaan is only promised land in potential it's a land flowing with milk and honey but it's not Egypt and it's not the northern kingdoms Babylon Nineveh Assyria it's not those it's only potential of course we're not going to reach that potential until we get to to David and Solomon and it's gonna sort of remain this it's not really full wilderness it's sort of potential wilderness it's potential land but still with some wilderness aspects and that's what Canaan will be for a while and that comes out true in the book of in the book of Joshua now now key to this will be an attempted transition of moral imaginary because Egypt has a firm moral man that imaginary the the the the large cities of Mesopotamia have firm moral imaginaries you have Hammurabi's law and you have obviously Egypt and their and their temples and their and their priests and you're gonna transition out of Empire Egypt into the kingdom of the Lord through Moses and then finally culminated in David and Solomon but we're not at that part of the story yet so Exodus is the beginning of this process and and in some ways yeah the story starts in Genesis but in some ways the story of Israel really starts in Exodus and that's part of why that's so key now Israel is sort of tribal plus you know the obvious tribal quality of Israel is there they're the 12 tribes of Jacob but there's this rabble that joins them when they come up out of Egypt and you find them referred to in Exodus 12 38 and numbers 11 4 and Joshua 8 35 and and so these are these are other opportunists as it were that say hey slaves are getting out let's go and and off they go and now remember what this errand is into the wilderness initially this is we're going to worship our God who we didn't know until Moses met him by the burning bush and came us and and told us his name and now we're gonna go and worship this God and others are like yeah we'll go too we're with them but we're not family but we're with them and off they go and the group that comes out of Egypt are equally defined and really become defined by the deliverance and and the identity is crafted not just by blood and and this isn't important but often not again a lot of celebrity atheists just pay attention to the the family tribal connection but a lot of these subtleties are lost in their low-resolution carping that Israel is always a mixed group of people and if you read if you read the Bible carefully you'll see all these little you know other people who are always around who have these little they're not really last names what they are tribal identifiers and you know biblical scholars go through and say they're not of Israel they're not of Israel and and so you see then these are the sojourners okay and that's sort of what they're referred to in Joshua 8 they're the sojourners who kind of come along with Israel and of course Israel is told to you know this moral imaginary that Moses is about to give is is not just for the people there are usually kind of two rules but these are the sojourners okay we're coming along and you ought to you ought to treat them well too why because you were a sojourner so because you were a sojourner you know treat the sojourners with hospitality and respect they have some obligations if they're sojourning among the kingdom of the Lord here but even though they're not necessarily part of us they're they're with us so identity is crafted not just by blood but by history and the within history God who rescues them and and you can see this one of the most important parts of the book of Exodus of course is that Decalogue and for those of you who really like the word logos well Decalogos that's Decalogue it's a Deca is is Greek for ten and these are the ten words and look how they begin God comes down on Sinai speak speaks to Israel with God's own voice and what does he say introduces himself and God spoke all these words saying I am I am I am the Lord your God again Lord is the name God is the title who brought you out of the land of Egypt the house of bondage that's how it begins and you'll find this refrain again and again and again and again and why because that identifies who they are they are now identified not simply by blood but increasingly by history and of course Jesus will take this and it'll get expanded in the church so that now it's not the blood of Abraham but it's the blood of Christ that defines the community all right and that gets rolled into baptism and the sacraments so God spoke all these words saying I am the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt out of the house of bondage you shall have no other gods besides me I took this from Tanakh which is the the Jewish translation of the Old Testament into into English just to be fair you know that it's Christian isn't playing with the translation and the whole question of these desert wanderings and the tabernacle is can a holy God live in the midst of an unrighteous people that's really the narrative tension that goes on throughout these these narrative wanderings but now to to think about it in terms of a moral imaginary so you're going from you know they were sort of in a wild west Canaan and then they go into Egypt now they're going to go into wilderness which is full wilderness where you know and and there's always this this commonality between desert and sea so the desert is kind of dry chaos where the sea is kind of watery chaos and and there are all these parallels and Exodus between watery Egypt and dry wilderness but for the Israelites none of this is sort of natural terrain for them but God is going to feed them with manna and care for them and love them and woo them and of course prophets will will go into this and and God is going to remake them and get them ready to go into the habitable land flowing with milk and honey and to become a new empire there in the promised land with their own imaginary all right their own moral imaginary so that it's not going to be sort of the wild west in which we find Jacob and Dinah and and Simeon and Levi it's there's going to be order here because there's going to be a king over it and the king over it is the Lord that's how this works and the sub king will be you know the Kings once they arise but the kind of the prophets you know Samuel become the judges earlier on before you have Kings and of course for warnings about the Kings which of course come true but you're constructing an entirely new imaginary not only with rules and boundaries but but processes of remediation and so when you have a situation like Shechem and Dinah well there's gonna have to be a judge that's what they're first called judges are kind of chieftains and then later a king who's going to be able to give justice and the land but but notice it's very interesting that in the Mosaic law it just kind of hangs there because well Moses is doing it as judge and later there will be judges but but but but it's it's almost like well the Lord is the one who's going to be enforcing this but enforcing it through whom now for much of Christian history there wasn't a lot of knowledge about the context of this book apart from the kind of information you could glean as I sort of done from this book Moses book sort of falls out of the sky as it were it doesn't really of course for much of history you've only got one book Moses book and it's sort of floating there ex nihilo and of course over the last 200 years there's been a lot of archaeology and scholarship and so here's a guy John Walton who was a professor over at Wheaton not a school anybody's going to charge with rabid liberalism who writes a bunch of books about ancient near eastern thought in the Old Testament and so for the last 200 years we've sort of been reading fragments and hints of the surrounding cultures and what we begin to see is that the context is important and now people usually jump too much on both sides of it politically tribally now is um oh it's just the same as all the rest of it or it's totally unique and what you'll see is that it's kind of both and it's it's it's situated in context but there's also a unique quality to it as well and I've brought that out use this book in some of my previous videos now why am I using these words moral imaginary in this because I get the word I'm using the word imaginary from Charles Taylor a secular age when I first read that book and I'm starting reading through what's this imaginary what's this imaginary and the longer I lived with that word the more I liked it and so Charles Taylor uses the word to get sort of to get out sort of a non-physical cultural intersubjective world each of us lives within that governs our aspirations dreams norms and practices now someone just recently sent me a link to a video of oh gosh I should probably find channel I didn't know anything about pretty major channel you know 800,000 views dark matter 2525 has all these little videos all these little videos about the Bible look at that it's sort of an atheist Bible project that he's running and here he has this talk with Andrew Seidel is Christian nationalism un-American and they spend a lot of this video basically saying American roots are anti-Christian and anti-biblical and there's a big stark division between these and I'm thinking no part of me thinks oh you should talk to Tom Holland but now that probably wouldn't go well but they're just trying to make the point that you know here there's these these two sides well I don't think you can really understand American culture outside the moral imaginary of Christianity and I think Tom Holland makes some incredibly important points now I say moral imaginary because we all have deep assumptions embraced pre-consciously about how the world should be as as Brett Weinstein says you know we were these two track creatures we have the DNA track and we have this culture track and and Christianity and the Greeks and some others are deeply woven into our assumptions about good bad right and wrong but another thing that's been so deeply woven into it has been this imperial practice of law and and not just law but but the imaginary upon which law relies so when you get John Locke talking about the consent of the governed well how did all the governed to get on the same page a lot of it was religion laws downstream from religion and it's also downstream from this sort of tradition moral culture tradition that was inhabiting Canaan when Abraham and Jacob and Dinah were there but suddenly you get now an enforceability and and and law gets things specific and and so law really sort of becomes this administrative moral code whereby well the people are always sort of participating in the moral imaginary and you know here here after a well coordinated well-funded concerted cultural effort to remake our thinking with respect to same-sex attraction and behavior reaches critical mass and boom that 2013 now suddenly it's law now it's it's law via the Supreme Court that's tricky way to get things in there and you know now as we're seeing with with Roe v. Wade well there's this constant tension between you know law from the Supreme Court case law versus the law created by by legislatures but but that's the moral imaginary is all in there but in within an imperial context like the United States now what I mean by Empire we'll go look at sapiens by Yuval Harari you know an Empire is a way by which many many many many language and family groups come and live under one umbrella now when this happens over a large period of time well in the United States we sort of have credo nationalism not ethno nationalism with credo nationalism and so we have these founding documents like the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution but yet the story of the people and this is something obviously that is over the last 50 years been under a lot of revision the story of the people kind of creates the moral imaginary that is here so American moral imaginary stories start with things like the pilgrims and the frontier and all of these themes kind of go into the moral imaginary and that that gets expressed there into laws and courts and all that stuff is is always working in our midst now as the last number of videos that I've made have been talking about there's there's been a lot of changes in this over the last 75 years and and you know we're not we're not sure if this last period is of unprecedented change or decay filled decadence we can't seem to make up our minds it's both of course because it depends what we're what we're looking at and fewer issues are as emblematic as the revolution over same-sex behavior see see in antiquity sexual behavior didn't define identity and I was thinking the other day how you know well so let's say you go to an office party and everybody's going to introduce themselves okay do you do you tell everybody in the office if you're gay well if you're Shechem do you tell everybody in the office if you're a racist not if you're a racist if you're rapist is rapist an identity well it's kind of becoming that isn't it I mean the me too movement now Joe Biden of course Donald Trump and Kavanaugh is is rapist an identity and well if it's an identity you know is it an immutable identity should rapists be a protected class or should rapists stay in the closet you see this business about identity is a pretty tricky thing and so when you look at the story about Jacob and Haymore and Dinah and Simeon and Levi and Shechem to what degree are their behaviors defining their identities now if you think about this long enough you'll say this is something that we probably have to think more about because in antiquity sexual behavior didn't define identity again Melinda Selmas's book sexual authenticity and the one that comes after it in the second book she's got this section that she put into a blog post called the gay Roman Emperor gene so if Nero rapes a sexual or if Nero rapes a political rival does that mean he's gay if Tiberius likes to go off to his seaside resort and have you know toddlers and juveniles swimming naked with him for his own sexual pleasure does that make him a pedo where exactly is the relationship between history and identity see in the ancient world just because well and recently in a video I brought up the case of a an Afghan politician here's a here's a story that was in the New York Times a couple of years ago no shame Afghan generals victory lap stuns a victim of rape instead of being taken away in handcuffs those accused of heinous heinous crimes in this country have been seen strolling the red carpet in the winter of 2016 meets mr. E. Chi went on national television to accuse general Abdul Rashid Dostrom the vice president of a government bank rolled by the United States of abducting him then punching him and kicking him until a pool of blood formed under his feet general Dostrom he said next dropped his pants and tried and failed to rape him before asking his guards to sexually assault him with their guns okay what identity does that make this Afghan general is he gay because this is what he wanted to do with his political adversary you can begin to see the complexity of the question of identity and history so in antiquity sexual behavior didn't define identity no such thing as a gay or homosexual person in the ancient world people did stuff now we sort of see this well I don't eat meat I'm a vegan okay that's your identity well your identity can be pretty fluid and so when we look at sort of what's been happening so of course you know born that way that was really instrumental in getting same-sex marriage because well they it wouldn't be appropriate for them to choose someone of the opposite sex but then okay but now let's say you're bi or let's say you're fluid well in the ancient world they just didn't see people in the same way as they see people now Christianity's eventual victory in the West sent same-sex behavior into the closet that's true and that took a process and again you can read Kyle I can't read his last name don't remember right now from shame to writes about that process you know it's same-sex behavior has not been affirmed by any major religion for 1,500 years or more that's an interesting thing and then whoosh it sweeps the world well it's swept part of the world and you know now we're gonna try and have the United Nations enforce it and this is where we get into the covenant of Moses because in a sense what what the covenant of Moses brings is a mosaic moral imaginary into existence the mosaic law now now in some ways you know we bring that word into this and and that's a more complex word than we think the mosaic law attempts to establish a moral imaginary for a new people of Israel to inhabit and so all of the rules about eating and not eating and clean and unclean and where you can be and where you can't be and inside the gate and outside the gate all of this is training in a moral imaginary for a nation and the practices are deep deeply integrated as part of the training about who they are and what they should do but before we get into a book like Leviticus or Exodus or Deuteronomy where you have these prescriptions about behavior it's important to pause and think about this step because that's you you shouldn't read the mosaic code without understanding what's going on in this in terms of the historical narrative in terms of the biblical flow of history and and that's why you know this young man says hey wait a minute you're not allowed to eat shellfish well we eat shellfish and then and then people will you know I'll hear Christians quickly jump in and say well we've laid aside the dietary laws because of what Jesus said yeah but you're gonna have to pay some closer attention to this whole process we've laid a lot across we've laid aside the ceremonial law yeah we've not laid aside the moral law well part of the point of the Covenant was that what you ate was a moral decision as it increasingly is today among certain people and the reason that food no longer had a moral component doesn't simply go back to Jesus in the Gospel of Mark it also has a great deal to do with the Protestant Reformation when reform people were known as sausage eaters and when the Roman Catholics were abstaining from meat on Friday and the Protestants went around munching on sausages in front of them saying aha so there we can eat whatever we want we're Protestant you're Catholic you've got your feasting day and your fasting days and now of course in some ways some of this is coming back around where you have Protestants fasting for Lent and 75 years ago the church that my grandparents were pastoring and attending if you had Protestants talking about Lent and fasting for Lent and giving up things for Lent people would have might put you under discipline in the Christian Reformed Church for being papished, papish or Romanish so there's a lot of stuff that's been changing and it's really helpful to before we go getting to slap happy one way or the other about these changes to pause and think a little bit about what are we talking about here so the Mosaic Law attempts to establish a moral imaginary for the new people of Israel to inhabit it's important to pause to recognize the importance of this historical cultural anthropological development of development of this as such now again there are there are practices like this in Egypt there are practices like this in Mesopotamia, Canaan sort of the Wild West and so again God is giving these new practices and and so in that sense Canaan is this space where it's not wilderness where you really can't have a people except with divine assistance constantly it's it's this other space land flowing with milk and honey where you can have a people and and so Israel will perpetually be a people in between in a land in between in their world and this law would become the foundation eventually because of what happens in history and you know the laws of Egypt are forgotten and the laws of the Medes and Persians are mostly forgotten but the Mosaic Code is there and so this will become sort of the first draft of moral imaginaries of people who want to stay in identity continuation with the God of Moses but but they're not it's the first draft and one of the things you're going to see is that this first draft keeps getting tinkered with one of the things that I did in seminary that was a real eye-opener was I did a study of how specific laws changed from Exodus to Deuteronomy why would they change between Exodus and Deuteronomy might want to look into a question like that there's a lot of answers that have been given but the fact that there's change there is important and and the fact that on one hand a Christian might say well same-sex behavior is an abomination because of Leviticus 18 well you're seeing the continuation and then another person says hey wait a minute you happily munched on that shrimp yesterday shrimp are you know shrimp are not clean foods and so throw away the law well it's not really one or the other and when you read the New Testament it's not really either or there's a lot more nuance and so you know all the way to the Protestant Reformation I mean usury doesn't get a set aside until John Calvin figures up a theological justification for lending money at interest now what happened was the division that John Calvin had with respect to that question gets forgotten and now we just lend money at interest without thinking a thing of it Old Testament prophet I had had this little saying he said you know if you only have as a pastor if you only have time to read one book about a text you have to preach in read the book that it's in oh what do you mean by that well that the primary context for understanding a passage in the book of Leviticus is the book of Leviticus read the whole book reading the whole book of Leviticus might be more helpful to you in understanding what a particular verse in Leviticus means than necessarily grabbing a commentary off my shelf and reading what one scholar says about that one verse if you read the whole book you begin to get a sense of what's going on in this book and and especially if you read a book like Leviticus you begin to say well this is a strange book there's a lot of strange things in this book some of the stuff I'm not sure I how I feel about it now again a lot 2000 years of Christian history there's ready-made answers to either take things on the shelf or put things off the shelf you should take things off the shelf or put things on the shelf a little dyslexic use of the English language there so read the whole book and all of its strangeness before you necessarily want to either take Leviticus 18 and say oh that's a lot that's over there with not eating shrimp or take Leviticus 18 and say that's an abomination find out what other things are abominations and figure out why you think some things are and some things are do your homework so people want to jump into Leviticus 18 on this subject but before you get there you have to wrestle with what is the Bible itself what are these books of Moses what is the law and you're going to have to as a Christian deal with Jesus and the law here in the gospel of Matthew verse you know verse 17 do not think I have come to abolish the law of the prophets I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them well pretty quickly you're going to be saying it's not what goes into your mouth that makes you that defiles you it's what comes out of your mouth and well we don't have to wait too many verses well truly I tell you until heaven and earth disappear not the smallest letter not the least stroke of a pen will by any means disappear from the law and iv added a capital L no capitals in the original language that's a newer convention that we use until everything is accomplished what do you mean by accomplished therefore anyone who sets aside the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven oh but you say they're still in but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven for I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law you will not enter into the kingdom of heaven oh now we're now now it's an in and out thing you have heard it said to the people long ago you shall not murder yeah yeah what you heard it heard it said that's that's one of the ten words from Sinai Jesus you're gonna edit this this is what we're in for oh maybe Jesus gonna water down murder and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment I tell you anyone who is angry with your brother or sister will be subject to judgment no Jesus you're supposed to water it down now you're now you're saying even if I get angry again anyone who says to his brother or sister Rocka is answerable to the court anyone who says you fool and will be in danger of the fire of hell Jesus you're supposed to Jesus is supposed to what exactly so yeah let's let's not be fast and loose this is youtube we've got time compare parallel laws and exodus and deuteronomy understand interpretation and application see what Jesus does with Moses see how the new testament handles the old testament now thanks to Moses and the previously post Dunbar world the moral imaginary significant in terms of the development of the self which by the way is the non-physical instantiation of every individual participating up into principalities if you go to where I started this the first thing that I read marriage equality is essential because it is a societal statement of affirmation of the value of same-sex attracted individuals they are no longer second class citizens that's dependent upon the establishment of a moral imaginary where the individual participates in a principality now you say well when I read the second slide Paul that the first slide reads different yeah it does the first slide doesn't go away and so and so well on one hand you can understand why people say I'm treated as a second class citizen and America is all about equality that's why you've got all these equal signs on cars in California and I feel like I feel like a second class person okay so on one hand good point on the other hand you're also basing your identity on this moral imaginary are you sure you want to do that what other historical things in you are you tempted to base your identity on remember in the Lord of the Rings when one golem is talking to the other and the big one is really good episode really good interview with Douglas Murray in with rebel wisdom and David Fuller just out lately on coronavirus Douglas Murray tells a story of I was a doctor someone who worked in a prison and how you know you could find lots of people that blamed society for the evils that they did you couldn't find anyone who said that they were the society so on one hand we have the very real situation that once you have a moral imaginary which is very much kind of the we believe in the consent of the governed laws are established by the consent of the governed okay they're bottom up well in Jacob and Dinah well there's no real laws it's just sort of the consent of the people around there okay and then they get instantiated into law but laws change do you really want to put people in the closet who are against the laws today that laws were different 50 years ago this moral imaginary this mosaic moral imaginary is actually a really important thing Dawkins and the Ten Commandments when he was an unbelievable if you haven't listened to that it's a great episode I've listened to it a number of times love to decry the movie promotion mind monuments same thing with this other video that um you know dark matter 2525 loves to decry the the movie promotion monuments but just try to get rid of commands against murder theft adultery perjury see how he goes apparently the author of this book shows how none of the use all the u.s. law are somehow in some clean room apart from the bible and I thought I might break down and buy this book because I'm really dubious about the quality of any argument that can actually get you there but even if the commands but even if the commandments we all agree upon we're so self-evident why do we have so much trouble in keeping them the video I put last year the numinous and the moral refer back to C.S. Lewis's problem of pain this passage from the problem of pain just sticks in my head and continues to twist on it he makes this observation about the law morality like numinous awe is a jump so Lewis says you know basically have five senses and then we have more senses too one of senses of the numinous that's you know when we kind of feel spooky like there's a ghost around another is morality where we have where we have a moral sense and so Jacob and Dana and she and Simeon and Levi Simeon and Levi had a moral sense that they're treating our daughter like a prostitute and you're treating your daughter our sister like a prostitute and they ought not to be doing that and so we're going to take up swords and we're going to even the score because something has been violated in the universe that that shekoms now appeals to love cannot satisfy so they take the law into their own hands as we say well that's after thousands of years of moral imaginary becoming law and empire and institutions and all of this stuff that thank the lord for it so you're saying there's nothing in the bible that gives us our inheritance of law really i'm dubious c.s lewis says morality like numinous awe is a jump in it man goes beyond anything that can be given in the facts of experience well sort of what we've been off arguing in the last number of years or that all of these experiences that we have of moral feelings are depending on which side of the line they are either created by bigotry or heto enormity or all of this stuff or somehow come from the secret sacred self and and bloom us up into us i just know that i am this identity and therefore i should not only have the right to express it but be affirmed by everyone in its expression it's not that simple man goes beyond anything that can be given by the facts of experience and it has one characteristic too remarkable to be ignored c.s lewis says the moralities accepted among men may differ but not at bottom so widely as often claimed but they all agree in prescribing a behavior which their adherents fail to practice why do you find so many good men in prison so many innocent men watch shawshank redemption again all men alike stand condemned not by alien codes of ethics but by their own and all men therefore are conscious of guilt if you'd interviewed sheckham about what he did to dina oh well but i love her that's why you raped her that's why you couldn't have waited a little bit and sent haymore to jacob and said sheckham's seen dina he's attracted to her and you know can we arrange a deal by which sheckham and dina can perhaps become man and wife and we can become two tribes and okay the circumcision thing kind of unusual a lot to ask but kind of unusual a lot to ask but you got a lot of flocks we got a few foreskins maybe we can cut a deal the moralities accepted among men may differ but they all agree in prescribing a behavior with which their adherents fail to practice all men alike stand condemned not by alien codes of ethics but by their own and all men therefore are conscious of guilt the second element in religion is the consciousness not merely of a moral law but of a moral law at once approved and disobeyed this consciousness is neither illogical nor an illogical inference from the facts of experience if we did not bring it to our experience we could not find it there it's coming from someplace else it is either inexplicable in an inexplicable illusion or else revelation it's revelation of something now c.s lewis will will go through this and say well there's these four strands and you have the numinous sense that we have in addition to our five sentences you have the the moral sense that we have in addition to our five senses and then the jews come along and these things are bound together that the awe and the moral in other words what i do with the numinous is not just instrumental to managing the numinous but also is conditional upon this moral and then there's this fourth strand or element is a historical event there was a man born among the jews who claimed to be or to be the son of or to be one with the something which is at once the awful hunter of nature and the giver of the moral law which we may easily be lulled into taking too lightly that only two views of this man are possible now he'll expand it to three and some will go to four this is the lewis's trilemma either he is a raving lunatic of an unusual abominable type or else he was and is precisely what he said there's no middle way if the ref if the records make the first i'm jesus smuggling here just so you know what i'm doing if the records make the first hypothesis unacceptable you must submit to the second and if you do that all else that is claimed by christians seems credit becomes credible that this man having been killed was yet alive and that his death in some manner incomprehensible to human thought has affected a real change in our relationship with the awful and the righteous lord and a change in our favor ever could a man be that one of my favorite cultural artifacts about the change in the moral imaginary is the sitcom my name is earl in the episode white lie christmas where earl's ex-wife's mother has a gambling problem and her gambling problem is taking stuff away from the whole family now this is while earl is trying to practice his karma and she goes through the whole show don't judge me don't judge me don't judge me we like to imagine the game is winning the moral imaginary getting the moral high ground morality creates its own status hierarchy and in the 90s don't judge me or seinfeld not that there's anything wrong with that suddenly in the 2010s affirm or be on the margin now again listen to jonathan peugeot when he talks about the center and the margin that's really important stuff he's talking about but the questions remain how does that work in the church because really the series is about same-sex marriage and the church i'm not a political scientist i get to vote i'm a citizen got ideas but the series is about same-sex marriage and the church and the bible and so this video i'm not diving into the book of leviticus yet but we got to get there and we have to understand that moral imaginaries are consequential things moral imaginaries create moral failures and as c.s lewis noted well these laws we write these laws that we know will fail and we try to hold others to standards we can't hold ourselves to we demand a morality we cannot live up to we desire a hero who can not only do so on behalf of ourselves but afford something that invites us to live up to him and we're gonna have to get into leviticus and we're gonna have to talk about that strange book because it's a strange book but it's a real i mean if there's a book in the bible that so often people will say i don't know what's going on here it's in leviticus and when i decided i was going to preach through the bible and i got to leviticus boy there was some real temptations to jump but i thought not we should go into it and i was really glad i did i learned a ton going into the book of leviticus it's a strange book but first before we go there we have to understand the moral imaginary and we have to understand how the moral imaginary is at work in our culture and how people live into it marriage equality is essential because it is a societal statement of affirmation of the value of same-sex attracted individuals they are no longer second-class citizens this is a powerful argument it is probably legally true within a moral imaginary within a moral imaginary within our a moral imaginary the church has to bear witness to christ within this moral imaginary i began this video saying i'm going to say a lot of things some of you aren't going to like and probably some of you on both sides of this highly polarized debate in my denomination a lot of people haven't liked my continued plea for a confessional conversation many people good friends of mine say we're done talking it's time to vote and split i can't stop you i'm only one vote if i get sent to senate but i'm not done talking and if there's anything you know about my channel i like to talk and i talk plenty so before we get into the mosaic moral imaginary we should understand what a moral imaginary is the impact that it has on individuals in terms of how they see themselves within principalities we should understand the context of the book of leviticus it's going to cut both ways and at some point we have to figure out what we have to do now for some of you that's a daily thing because of how you have been formed for others of us it's a more theoretical hypothetical thing we can live in the in the liminal spaces for longer but i want us to do what we can in this space in the best way we can so i keep talking
