 Hi, this is Paul. Monday, of course, I put out a three-hour video. I do lurk on the Discord sometimes and Shelley was saying, I can't get through three hours and I completely understand. So a little too long didn't read it or too long didn't watch it for the three-hour video. The major change in the culture since the 1970s is that religiosity, as Robert Putnam has put it in his book Amazing Grace, now becomes the cultural dividing line. And one way to understand this is that you lose status in highly secular places for exhibiting usually Christian religiosity or some forms of religiosity in folk religion. Now, maybe in some places if you're wearing a hijab or you're wearing a saffron Buddhist robe, you might gain status in some places. But this has sort of become the dividing line in American culture. And I've just noticed lately that we're awash in secular, often atheist longing for wisdom. And that seems not completely unpredictable. Peter Boghossian just on Twitter tweeting out Charlie Munger's Top 10 Rules for Success. Now, whenever I see this, I always pause because can you really, and this is in some ways the question of value with respect to atheism, how do you determine value apart from really a religious foundation? And I sort of chuckle when I see these things because I'm old enough to remember the Christian Seeker Movement in the 80s and 90s that birthed a lot of politics and churches that really drive the atheist nuts and some of whom fled from this movement. Where you had Bill Hybels and Rick Warren using biblical wisdom to lure people in to the credibility of the Bible. And so in seeker churches in the 80s and 90s and early aughts and still some places in middle America today because the changes often happen at the coasts first, the sermons are, you know, five ways the Bible can help you improve your marriage. Five ways, five lessons from the Bible and how to raise your children. This wisdom approach to the Bible, you know, the plan was that you would really have a sharp sermon and these, and the, you know, this is also the time, kind of the heyday of Larry Krabs, and some of you won't know who Larry Krabs is, he was a Christian, he was a Christian psychologist and where sort of Christianity and Christian psychology merged together to give people successful tips and rules to help them have the family they've always wanted or the marriage they've always wanted and actually in many ways this really set up the conversation in Christian circles for purity culture and sort of this evangelical counterculture. But it was all about success. Now many of the skeptics looked at this Christian mode of success and said, some looked at it and said it's really desirable. Usually people who were coming out of very chaotic households, others looked at it and said, boy that looks tyrannical and stifling and like a straitjacket and in some ways what was happening in there was the working out of what Robert Putnam lays out in terms of the World War II, the 50s, which is 45 to 65, the 60s, which is really 65 to 75, and then the 80s, and then the aughts, and just this back and forth, back and forth, those who have their fill of chaos now seeking order and those who have their fill of order now seeking chaos and all of this to say that success is not a neutral term and its neutrality is, its lack of neutrality is exposed when, again if you look at the conversation John Vervecki and I had, when it gets instantiated in a living, breathing, human being or a family and so wisdom is a very tricky thing because on one hand there's a sense of wisdom that's seeking that image and another way an element of wisdom is understanding and a capacity to evaluate that image and to ask if that image really is finally and fully good and again the more you dive into the depths of these questions the more and more religious the whole operation becomes. So obviously Ryan Holliday's, I looked at his videos and it felt like seeker stoicism. I felt like in some ways I'm back in suburban America in the 80s and 90s and watching what Rick Warren and Bill Hybels had done in Christianity and watching this now applied to other ancient religions. I mean 30 years ago if you had told me I would be seeing, we didn't have YouTube 30 years ago, but I would be seeing people become popular, something akin to a mega church pastor but just online and I should talk being online myself, but something akin to a mega church pastor, a lifestyle guru who was selling stoicism because I pretty much, I mean I was familiar, when you'd read N.T. Wright's book, he would say things like really for a certain class in the Roman Empire the two dominant competing philosophies that Christianity had to engage with were stoicism and the Epicureans and in some ways, boy here we are right there again and at peak new atheism the mantra might have been whatever you do don't be a Christian, whatever you do don't be religious, but the difficulty is once you take in these these secular wisdom nuggets washed of metaphysical accumulations even from the ancient world don't think that they aren't going to attract new forms of religiosity and and of course we've seen this in the New Age movement, but just because someone imagines that well they've been through the baptism of Sam Harris that they'll be able to avoid religiosity, well you know look at my conversation with John Vervecky about inevitable religio, I mean it just keeps accumulating Andrew Roots, I mean the narrative in Andrew Roots the pastor in the secular age is easily worth the price of the book because he so nicely lays out really from the time of Darwin until now the how lost how pastors themselves have become lost sheep and I think so he leads it off by saying he's talking about a pastor that he met at a conference of course if there's anything quintessential to the seeker movements it was conferences at a conference and the pastor can confessing to to Andrew Root that he was lost he didn't know what he was doing and this pastor he was standing in the line of an old vocational tradition of course but he nevertheless felt like he was on new ground pastors like Augustine of Hipple and Thomas Becket and Jonathan Edwards never dealt with the fragility of meaning the flatness of our moments of passage the emptiness of the ordinary it would be as hard for them to understand the feeling of malaise as it would be as it would a smartphone now I kind of like to see Andrew Root and and James K.A. Smith have a conversation because of course the premise of Smith's new book is that no actually Augustine would very much understand that and Augustine sort of led the way out of it and I think they're both making very fair points obviously part of the difficulty is is to what degree can we really even imagine pouring ourselves into Augustine's world you know you see in the transubstantiation book with with Brett Sockel how just from Aquinas to Luther so much understanding was lost so that you know Luther would have put up a dartboard and threw darts at the post picture of of of Saint Aquinas but Brett Sockel's and I think rather compelling argument is that Luther was in a sense without knowing it trying to recapture what what Aquinas had did I say Aquinas a dartboard what Aquinas had achieved and and Luther you know maybe you know he was trying to approximate it with his consubstantiation and Calvin was trying to approximate it with his real presence but the the ground beneath their feet had shifted so of course James K. Smith argues that well that same thing sand was what Augustine was dealing with and here Andrew Root says no Augustine didn't have a meaning crisis and and James K. Smith says Augustine was quintessentially in the midst of a meaning crisis and well are we are we that sure we can travel back there with our imaginations or are our retelling and recasting of these ancient heroes just as in some ways appropriations as was done to Augustine by Calvin and Luther when they they really couldn't even hear Aquinas fairly so so Andrew Root goes on and says it's not the meaning rights of passage and the significance of the ordinary that have been annihilated it was just that they have been hollowed out repurposed for ends other than experiencing the defined now first of all let's not forget iconoclasm that that in fact the rights of passage weren't simply hollowed out maybe they continued in the Anglican and Episcopal and Lutheran and the high church traditions but in fact they were set aside in the low church traditions completely and even in Christian Reformed land where I have been which is always sort of this middle space in some places they were cast aside and and and everyone grabbed at the seeker ethos while while others have lingered and now they're being brought back in but this comes at an interesting time when again it's religiosity that is the it's Christian religiosity that is the stuff that will lose you status and and this is this is chasing experiencing the divine and I'm increasingly skeptical about our capacity to use even a phrase like that because in a in a world where the most ontological we can get about values are feelings where we've got moral feelings and even in even in the land of critical theory where where feeling is good enough to mount a prosecutor prosecutorial campaign against the injustices of history the seekers would have very much said well we have the smoke machine and the big band and the big sound and the the worship leader in skinny jeans so that you can feel the divine so that you can experience the divine and and we're very quickly at of course Andrew Root is writing downstream from Charles Taylor that you know the the experiencing the divine is exactly what has what has supernovad that well I'll experience the divine this way I'll experience the divine this way and and pretty soon they're they're back to the old saw of trying to feel the feel the elephant and and everybody's got a different piece of the elephant that they call god except of course the one who tells the story that says no it's an elephant and you all know what that means religiosity has everything to do with performative rights which is which is where Esther Meeks and I forget the other the the the prophet of New York that's been barking up this tree I should really have a conversation with him he basically said yes but I want to know his work a little bit better but where they're getting at that no it's and really where where Peterson was getting at because it's it's it's in the performance that the well the body keeps the score as we've learned from trauma and so in some ways we've gone from a dystopian zombies in the meaning crisis to looping virtual empty pleasures you know a decade ago the walking dead was the the hot tv commodity and in an hour or two hour long shows of of loss and agony we were trying to maybe experience the divine or at least grieve the loss of the divine from from the bottom and and now what we're seeing in shows like like upload and and the good place is that okay now that we fully cast ourselves in the role of God since since God is no longer believable now we're stuck with us being God and I'm sort of waiting I haven't checked if the the good place is fully on Netflix yet because the every season they have twists and turns and I don't want to give too many spoilers away but you can watch just the one season of you can watch just the one season of upload and in in a sense and and I know I saw some chatter between that you know the upload guy made sure he didn't watch the the the the good place shows because there's some they have some sitcom thing in the past we've gone from any dramas of zombies to to sitcom-y beautiful people living in the midst of their angst because you know what they've got all this power to achieve the good but they realize that their visions of the good are insufficient to actually deliver upon the longing in the middle of their hearts and and in that sense not only have we grown skeptical about the ontology of the divine but we've but we've lost our capacity we've lost our confidence in imagining what divinity would look like and so in a sense the pastoral illness that Andrew Root has been noting is further down the line now coming to the pastors and the priests who are filling the screens with the religious with the religious footing that that everyone is that that everyone is is really absorbing on Netflix and Amazon and even old school network TV now in all fairness to Sam Harris I actually made this video yesterday and only made half of it and threw it away kind of a long speech in it about my every Friday on the Discord server the bridges of meaning Discord server I'm doing a couple hours of chat with with the folks in the server and Sam Harris came up and I had to confess you know like some of the comments in some of my videos with Sam Harris when when I was looking at his some of his free will arguments and and not only do I see Calvinism in the in the woke culture but there's a lot of Calvinism in Sam Harris too and and perhaps someone asked me why why I read miracles so often because I've talked about that quite a bit CS Lewis's book miracles and and I had to confess that in many ways for many years before I had the video series where where you're all acting as my confessors so often in these videos you know I I had to deal with the part of my head that that that Sam Harris occupies and not Sam Harris himself because I never lived lived listened to much of his stuff but the the the the stuff from which sprint Sam Harris has sprung is in all of us and and I would feel myself slipping into into materialistic nihilism and and CS Lewis and miracles um would would reliably exercise that from me because if all there is is the is the whole show then I will slip into nihilism and and CS Lewis argued persuasively for me every time I'd read the book and I'd need to come back to it religiously would convict continue to be able to convince me that no this powerful story that that is suggested to you even when people don't know they're doing it isn't quite as airtight as everyone would imagine that that in fact virus the viral load has a fair amount of um a fair amount of dependence upon the amount of viral characters that you surround yourself with and the amount of coughing and sneezing and talking and singing that is done at you we're susceptible to all sorts of viruses so but but at the same time I understand Sam's confusion and outrage at religiosity those who practice religiosity work um beneath a relational assumption that is easily confused with magic I completely understand the the critique because oh you believe that that saying a prayer will will somehow mean you won't get COVID or or saying a prayer will somehow mean that that cancer will avoid you yeah a lot of Christians talk that way I don't think it's warranted given the fact that their savior is up on a cross or maybe that's why you go to a church where there isn't one on a cross and but the thing is the cross is empty not because he avoided it but because he went through it yeah you know the the the the facile cheap assumption that attending a a place or performing a right or reciting a special powerful or holy words can can somehow um um conjure a power that physics does not see that would never be the way I would assert that Christianity is it relates to a power that holds physics in its hand but that God as a friend of mine who was raised in a church that didn't believe in modern medical science and so his childhood diabetes went untreated you know well into his youth meaning that he had lifelong medical complications and died in his 40s um blind nearly deaf heart problems all the way around you know Brandon spent some time in church here with me you know he said well my God kills grandmas and puppies every day he said that with a lot of credibility and when he actually was home alone and felt was home alone and felt himself dying took a marker and wrote do not resuscitate on his chest just so nobody could shock him back into this world he wasn't looking for an upload at least not from the horizon corporation with all of their in-app purchases and I completely understand the need of ringing the Jesus smuggling out in order to get your science right and I think Jordan Peterson said it well I mean you sort of say okay I'm not going to look through this eye when I try to do science and it's perfectly legitimate to cover one eye when you're taking an eye exam or you're trying to figure something out and you're applying your pro you're you're attempting to apply the spirit of geometry to something that that perhaps will yield itself to that and and in fact of course the the originators of modern science were deeply Christian men who who believed that God would not fool them but that God would reveal himself to those who asked and to those who sought and and that's probably the best one of the best parts of of that conversation between Eric Weinstein and Ross Douthat there's no gap for your God sir and and Eric in all honesty noting that when it comes to applying this when it comes to applying this the scientists just as readily hide their gaps as the as the as the carnival preacher make sure that only those who can be healed make it up to the stage and pay no attention to all of those who who have prayed the prayer but continue to walk on crutches back to a home filled with pain only after we exercise the rights can we get down to the business using physics to get what we want but right in there is the key that science doesn't tell us anything people who are looking at science are telling us something and the manifest image itself is never exercised from the application of any science you might find and then of course along comes Jordan Peterson and his his five-part video on the death and resurrection of Christ from 2018 is back up on his YouTube channel which is a good thing because you know when I listen to him because Jordan of course takes these two worlds and and is trying to put them back together again that's a really hard thing and and in many ways Jordan's biblical series was was was a sign of trying to put those two worlds back together again and and one of the observations that Jordan made in this video was that well sacrifices work and and of course that's what makes Sam Harris terribly nervous and then Sam says yeah but understand something that science is wielded by people and and when you bargain with the future you're bargaining with people that that that the two eyes are not separated by a blinder but they're both right here and the same neck and the same head are moving the the vision of science and the manifest of image both at the same time and and the more power we take with with covering one eye the more power human beings have and so you're not going to pull these things the pulling these things apart was already it was always just a a tactical move but any application of it puts it together and so that's why Jordan comes together and and and crosses the streams and makes and makes believers that we actually can drive this way into skeptics with that have to pay very high auto insurance rates and and i've noticed that that that you know Jordan was in a sense a harbinger even even Scott Adams who is you know i read Scott Adams book on success after the Trump campaign because i like many you know Scott called it right and and so i haven't been following Scott closely lately but he's a very intriguing figure and he's getting even more interesting and a viewer sent me this video where where you can read and you can i can you know i had plenty of clips in previous videos of of Scott sounding like a celebrity atheist increasingly he's sounding like Jordan Peterson and in other words oh you thought you can stop the Jordan Peterson contagion by by by exiling Jordan away or shouting him down or debunking him or something but it's spreading without Jordan and and part of it is the simulation theory and and Scott Adams points to a red pill podcast of sorts in this video about the simulation theory and and i could i could feel right away when i heard the simulation theory that yeah this is as somebody said this is um you know this is religion for atheists and i think it's really theism or even polytheism for atheists because of course how many how many people are up there creating these games that are simulating the consciousness in which we work and i even though i've heard various takes on the simulation theory the the podcast was a very well put together and compelling articulation that that Scott Adams in even though embedded in all of his skepticism puts out there and says well you know if you look at this by all odds we're in a simulation and i think simulation is a is a horrible word for it we're someone else's computer game and and who knows what what life looked like for them and that's why i think the word simulation is a terrible name for it because why would they why would they simulate us but but simulation is sort of what makes the argument work in sort of a a a subconscious level that suddenly people begin to imagine yeah and and the red pill and this is again sort of the continual confusion with with Jordan Peterson and conservatism that he's sort of a conservative but it's not exactly conservatism and it's it's it's it's a new thing and it's an old thing and and maybe there's some decadence involved in terms of a return but does this make your well yeah it it it leads people down the path to looking for not only an imaginary that is capable of affording hope but rights and rituals and religiosity that can make it believable and just today i talked to Cassidy and i'll be probably sharing her video in a day or two and you know how many people exploring orthodoxy and roman catholicism deeply sacramental and and even in my reformed camp and and this this movement started before i noticed Jordan Peterson that the church plants in the 90s that were using seeker methodology now here on the coasts have all switched to smells and bells and sacraments and liturgy and and even the christian reform churches and it's it's fascinating watching this migration migration and of course they're not reading charleston they're not listening to Jordan Peterson they're just following what they're following in a sense the progression it was walking dead and now it's good place and upload now it was angsty dystopian zombie apocalypse and now it's angsty human simulations now now scott adams is so so postmodern and i know some of you will say how is how is how is both the woke world and scott adams postmodern well i'd say in some ways scott adams is more postmodern than woke world why because scott adams even though he came into this debunking religiosity he's learned from donald trump who and i agree with what eric weinstein said in his video he's he's a genius of performity and and and how is it donald trump donald trump's base is the are the deplorable religiosity camp exactly the kind of person that j.d vance is writing about and so you know the fact that some of these critters in the in the in the idw are scary smart like the weinstein brothers and jordan peterson well i'm not always i'm not always sure they fully consciously know the track they're following but the track isn't that hard to discern for me because i know religion and religiosity now now now scott adams says once you realize that you have the power of filters which is basically the frames that we've been talking with our fancy vervekey in words um you can design the future to your tastes but that's exactly where that's exactly where these the good place and and upload step in because well what are your tastes and if if there's anything that the good place i mean the good place starts talking philosophy but ends in skepticism at least a a skepticism in the confidence of the human imagination to deliver finally what our hearts long for and in that sense james ka smith is dead on right that yeah we've wound up back with augustin and basically upload is saying okay you can have your fantasies if you have the money to pay for it if you're if you're as if you're as fat as elon musk or or or peter teal but but look at elon musk and peter teal elon musk every time you get him on joe rogan we're talking simulation and peter teal he goes to a lutheran church so you know you know scott adams should be really nervous about stopping and asking himself where do your tastes and desires come from because you're going to wind up either with a nihilistic meaning crisis or in the arms of some kind of religion which will lead to religiosity in some ways scott adams video reminded me a lot of of michael of michael and karen when when i talked to them not too long ago michael said to luke on the discord server rewatch personality 12 of 2017 it's sort of an abridged jordan peterson you've got the cognitive side the world is too big the a priori structure that he tried to deliver to sam harris but sam harris didn't want to have a conversation as much as his usual debunking tour you can press the world down into cartoons and stories in order to engage them religion is the jpeg of being but but and the future is full of potential but if all we have left are human beings in order to even imagine the potential maybe something that we can pull off virtually maybe we'll escape the zombie utopia by going into a bunker with a nuclear reactor and and and servers that will keep dishing up to us the the best utopian dreams we have you go to upload and you realize either they're going to be commercial with in-app purchases or we're going to get to a point where our in that a religious imagination hits the limits of our skulls or even of our capacity to collaborate and it's all just boring and so we need to make a perpetual line of computer game after computer computer game and maybe it's going to be a little island on on nintendo oh shoot nintendo the new lettuce thing the new little thing the little island where you have the little people i'm watching my kids play it or or it's it's going to be civ 16 so that i can continue to try to hope that the ai gets better because when i play against my sons and when i play against the ai it's a completely different game maybe we're we're purgatory is becoming increasingly believable because if you look at the good place and if you look at if you look at upload they look very much like purgatory because not even can the divine no longer be imagined but but neither can some future ideal state for us and so the celebrity at the atheist say ah you're better off with the big sleep it's divine it's it's it's a catological suicide not merely annihilationism for those who don't make the cut and and we very quickly realize which is why all the all the good advice giving that controlling your future means controlling yourself and yeah read the stoics it isn't easy to control oneself when biological survival no longer forcing you into meaningful endeavors there needs to be something outside of yourself to push you to be what you can become but as we as we close off one eye and we gain so much power and we become the victims of our own success and we become decadent you choose your own sacrifice jordan peterson's going to say well the sacrifice is so full of people the usual acting out gets you nowhere and you'll notice this if you pay attention which if you look at those who are are looking for a religion that isn't a religion or the or the stoicism or or going back to church they're smart they paid attention they've realized something and they've realized that if they're their own god they've got a lousy god so so the good advice people while there is life there is potential for a future so don't waste your now but but it kind of falls into the okay here you go scott user interface on the reality now you can get what you want but what do i want what should i want what happens when i keep getting what i want when i win the super bowl and i've already been to disneyland three times and they don't deliver happiness the happiest place on earth right they don't deliver happiness as well as possible so it's it's it's disney forever that i get uploaded in or is it horizon if i've got it if i've got an unlimited data package and i'm not down in the two gig room meaning is found jordan will say in the pursuit the engagement they're reaching well in a sense right away if you think it through well will the city on the hill really finally fully satisfied how will i know what if you're in a tough spot what if the government is against you you know just because i don't like the the woke ish imagined solutions for sexism or racism or bigotry of every of every sense by no means is that a good thing but i think it's a good thing because it's a good thing because it's a good thing because it's a good thing because it's a good thing because it's a good thing because it's a good thing because it's a good thing because it's a good thing because it's a good thing because it's a good thing because it's a good thing because it's a good thing because it's a good thing because it's a good thing because it's a good thing because it's a good thing because it's a good thing because it's a good thing because it's a good thing because it's a good thing because it's a good thing because it's a good thing because it's a good thing because it's a good thing because it's a good thing because you're going to want to save you now just because they have a racist counselor i mean this stuff is just recycled versions of all sorts of other religions including conservative calvinism and and just because people say i'm totally depraved doesn't make them any less depraved doesn't make them any less a victim of of all kinds of their epithomias if you're listening to my first draft and the things inhabiting their soul what if you're in a tough spot what if you don't have enough money to get uploaded to horizon or one of the upscale future servers that that will give you all you can eat buffets and lovely sunsets to watch well now we're in a virus and do we dare end the decadence doubt that ass in the book well maybe where it's not going to be our choice maybe maybe all of the belief that we had in our capacity as harari names it to to overcome pandemic and war and famine maybe as eric weinstein said we just had a good 75 year run you know nobody expected the first world war either because and that they they made war illegal they tried doing that in the 20s and 30s too well let's have the league of nations and we'll make war illegal yeah good luck with that didn't work we have the second world war so dare to end decadence the pandemic comes unbidden a very predictable crisis crushes our confidence in our capacity to achieve our goals and as as we're seeing right now on the internet well maybe sweden and herd immunity has the right idea and then someone will say yeah but you don't really know that that herd immunity will come we're just all facing a huge degree of uncertainty so don't be surprised when religiosity makes a comeback then you you first just started thinking stoic thoughts but pretty quickly you're gonna really hope for a stoic shrine or a stoic ritual and you say no that's not stoicism ah yeah look at the buddhist shrines and the buddhist rituals too why do you think in places in the world where buddhism has been around for a very very long time you're sacrificing goats to hopefully get the airplane off the ground right i can show you the clip in putnam's book he has a chart let's see did it put the graph in there it is i'll go back and look at it again and again in my videos i've made the note that it's during the cold war that american religiosity as measured in religious service attendance peaks and there's the chart in the 1960s you know hovered around 40 percent and then boom in the 50s it takes a big step up and then in the 60s it starts to come down and sort of been wobbling around that 40 percent kind of up and down and up and down and a little lower and you might say well why why in the 50s with all of our science and with all of our things did did it spike well robert putnam has an idea let's listen to him since the flux is a constant and he goes through all the the ways that they try to measure this stuff because you get more religious when you get older and and and he runs through it all so you can read it if you want to since flux is a constant in american religion there is no normal period in our religious history and certainly not the 1950s the years after world war ii witnessed an unusual surge in public religiosity so much so that some observers classified it as another great awakening of evangelical fervor that had been punctuated american religious history helping to produce some epochal some epochal events as the american revolution the abolition movement and the progressive era that labeling of the 1950s was in retrospect misleading because unlike the ecstatic enthusiasms of earlier awakenings the post-war surge was channeled primarily through conventional and even establishment institutions unlike the 70s pretending no great revolution either civil or religious for our story the post-war period is important primarily as the backdrop for momentous religious changes of the ensuing half century the anxieties of world war ii seemed to have revived american interest in religion that had flagged in the 20s and 30s no atheists and foxholes so yeah if we're going to have another depression this one pandemically induced uh fellow pastors don't count that it'll necessarily mean a bump in your lifestyle no atheists and foxholes it was said though elsewhere wars had been had been associated with decline of religion world war ii certainly was in europe post-war affluence social mobility and the onset of the cold war and its attendant nuclear standoff encouraged a paradoxical mixture of optimism and anxiety and a renewed appreciation for traditional values including both patriotism and religion recruit thor to beat the godless communists most important the returning veterans and their wives began producing what would soon be called the baby boom then as now getting married settling down raising children were associated with more regular church going the resulting surge in religious involvement during the 1950s was truly massive even compared to the seismic events later in the century figure 3.5 outlines the ups and downs of religious attendance in america over the 70 years the level of religious attendance reported in the gallup surveys probably exaggerated the reality especially in recent decades when most other service so survey showed gradual decline virtually all experts agree however that the period from the late 1940s to the early 1960s was one of exceptional religious observance in america here's figure 5.3 if you're watching the video the upsurge was heavily concentrated among 20 somethings figure 5.6 pulls together evidence from scores of gallup surveys to illustrate that while all generations participated in this post-war upsurge it was especially marked among young adults in their 20s in the 1950s in that group weekly church attendance skyrocketed from 31 in february of 1950 to an all-time record for young adults of 51 in april of 1957 an astonishing rate of change in 11 in seven years implying millions of new church growers every year and as we've seen in america with this book was written in 2010 and the decline from 2010 to 2020 these ups and downs can come fast further analysis this time of the national election studies archives shows that the surge was somewhat greater among whites and among college educated men isn't this interesting of white men aged 21 to 34 this is the jordan peterson cohort of white men aged 21 to 34 weekly church going rose from 28 percent in 1952 to 44 percent in 1964 who were these unusually pious young men of all americans born in the 1920s 80 had served in the military during world war two and after the war many took advantage of the g.i bill to become the first college educated persons in their families it was the g.i generation who as young husbands and fathers together with their wives led the surge to church in the late 1940s and 1950s in 1950s we saw earlier that this cohort would remain unusually observant high religiosity for the rest of their lives throughout all the shocks and aftershocks of the ensuing half century and even into the next millennium the g.i's and their wives and widows would form the bedrock of an american religious of american religious institutions and the civil institutions as well the surge had no particular political cast republicans and democrats liberals and conservatives were equally represented among those thronging to the pews rather the distinguishing features of the young men now occupying their wives now accompanying their wives to church accompanying their wives to church were that they were mostly young fathers mostly veterans were that they were mostly young fathers mostly veterans and mostly college educated charles colson the post-war boom the church going was fueled above um was fueled above all by men who had survived the day the great depression as teenagers and world war two as grunts and were now ready at last to settle into normal life that normality they had never known but could only dream and that dream would become the 1950s normal life with a steady job the same dream that eric weinstein is saying why can't we reproduce this again read george marsden's twilight of the american of the american enlightenment because those 1950s were a lot more angsty which would yield the 1960s as as marsden who is is a very competent historian lays out so they were ready now to settle into a normal life with a steady job a growing family a new house and car and respectable middle class status church going was an important emblem of that respectability religiosity used to be an emblem by which you gained status if you were having the three martini lunch you bragged about the fact that you were on the board at the episcopal church and you were helping raise money for the new worships it wasn't called a worship center for the new cathedral look at the american cathedral in washington that's there it is right there singling out the sociological center of the surge should not obscure how widespread religious engagement was during this period visibly in nearly all segments of society dr martin luther king jr mobilized the black churches of the south but religiosity among at amongst african-americans was higher than as it is higher now that's more the constant it was the white college-educated men that were the variability in fact the returning gis were merely narrowing the gap in church attendance with women blacks and older americans who had always been and remained more observant than young white men so the gis deserve pride of place account only on um pride of place in our account only on the theological principle that the newly saved merit special praise in other words everybody had always been then and the white men coming back from the war were the ones joining them in church and their money and their influence and all of the chutzpah and organizational skills that they learned in the army were now devoted into the creation of the mainline and evangelical churches that surged in that period the most visible in the most visible and mainline protestant and catholic churches the surge was felt in all religious traditions stretching this period against the backdrop of more than three centuries of american religious history as this is summarized american religious communities of nearly every type protestant catholic and jewish churches sex and cults were favored through the post-war decade and a half by an increased commitment and remarkable popular desire for institutional participation these young white men took on the high status jobs and their money flowed into the respectable religious organizations which now you're anticipating where putnam is about to go next were exactly what was responded against by the counterculture and we'd have a tick tock tick tock of religiosity until we get to sort of the the polarized moment that we have now but here we have a roman catholic running against a prosperity gospel person which one is known for cheating on his wives and family and remarried into another one and you would imagine surely the republican is the roman catholic and the and the serial divorcee who's got a reputation for chasing playboy tail would be the democrat and you'd be wrong playboy tail would be the democrat and you'd be wrong what's happening now should it be any wonder that we're reaching an inflection moment when well gosh maybe i'll be stoic but but but but but my stoicism is very protestant it's all up here in my head and i have to somehow find a token remember inception when he's spinning the top you need something physical that you can connect between this world and the next i i recommended to to john vervecky in my conversation with him yesterday laura hildebrand's unbroken read it don't watch the movie read the book listen to the audiobook i remember listening i was when i was listening to this audiobook my kids were in high school and i'd often listen to audiobooks kind of as a parent driving them to school and i'd pick audiobooks that i thought that they would appreciate and boy it's rough the the guy goes from being stranded on a raft to to a japanese pow camp with the most sadistic with the most sadistic japanese warden in the war and survives it and comes back to america with all kinds of good fortune to to marry the woman of his dreams only to realize he can't beat the bottle and he finds salvation at a billy graham rally and it changes his life a world war two story of survival resilience and redemption well you've got to hold up unbroken and you've got to hold up mad men and you got to look at them both inevitable religio it comes to us you're you're you're you're going to start thinking first i've in a very protestant way first i've got to reform my brain and then very quickly you realize no that that the things that i want are conditioned by my body so not only do i have to free form my brain i need to reform my practice the substance of the movement will be compressed and expressed in ritual first you act it out jordan peterson says in biblical series number one and we watch ourselves acting it out do you think we left that stuff behind just because we have talking and fancy words and and images and and virtual realities that we can upload no why do you go to star wars a rocky horror picture show in outfit why is cosplay something that you read on twitter all the time religio is inevitable watch the seem to leave skin in the game talk at google fascinating talk he asked them the question if you want to write a book to survive what do you write takes a few answers you write about old technology the lindy effect old technology has a huge advantage over new technology why it's jordan peterson argument because it's endured but here we are which divine is it sort of the metaphysical afterlife where we're living in a simulation sort of in the good place or is it just the simulation you're uploaded into in an upload or do you have do you trust both in the capacity of another beyond your own and in the goodness of agents to do what we cannot do ourselves well baby you're knocking on the door religion and one of my rough drafts i i read one of my favorite c.s lewis books in the last battle where they discover that narnia the narnia that they've been living in that there's a true narnia further up and further in but it's not designed by some by some corporation horizon in competition with disney for for your upload daughter and your your upload dollar and your in-app purchases moments and instances of well-being point to a more enduring well-being lewis says the future well-being must be instantiated into the actual well-being at least in terms of glimpses and moments that see through to something more permanent than us now if you bite down in the simulation theory the irony of that it's is that it's sort of an inversion of lewis's platenism as such we're looking for portals where we're drawn to the glory we feel the despair and and and when we see the instances the instances and glimpses of of a shalom and a glory that we can't grasp ourselves we long to put it in a bottle but no bottle we find can contain it we lean into this trusting that the final consummation is is a gift secured by another something that is beyond what we can conceive of which is both moreness and suchness yeah if you're if you're scott adams you know you can play the deep skeptic now that you've got money you've got popularity you've got all of this but what happens when the doctor says you've got cancer and yeah we've got we've got morphine we can pump you full of morphine so you don't feel anything well how well is is that user interface going to work for you scott i don't hope that on you but i'm by plenty of by plenty of hospital beds with people on morphine drips i've been around i see what this world does
