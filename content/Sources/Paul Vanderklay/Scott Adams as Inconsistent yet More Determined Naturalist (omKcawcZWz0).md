 Hi, this is Paul and I wanted to make a video about Scott Adams because I want to bring Scott Adams into the longer CS Lewis miracles rationality conversation that we've been having I actually started reading Scott Avon Scott Adams before I Discovered Jordan Peterson and I read his not his win Bigley book Which is the most recent one but how to fail at almost everything and still win big and I started reading Scott Adams Because of the Trump election because after Trump was elected I Wanted to find out I Obviously I know I know people who voted for Trump and You know, some of those people are in my church some of some people in my church would never vote for Donald Trump I I Very much would I very much want to have a church that has both sides of the political aisle in it Because I don't want my church to be about politics but I I wanted to I wanted to listen to someone who had a rationale for voting for Trump beyond just that they were Republican or So so I found I found Scott Adams and I read his book and Right away. I found he was an interesting creature and he was interesting creature partly because of his epistemology because what I found With Adams was someone who was a naturalist and I thought someone who was trying to be a more thorough going consistent naturalist or materialist then Then let's say Sam Harris and so in an upcoming video. I'm Gonna put I'm gonna note the Sam Harris Scott Adams Podcast that Sam Harris made which I thought was a very interesting conversation and at some point I want to bring Jordan Peterson into this and also, you know As I said, we'll talk some CS Lewis in this but for some of you probably don't know Sam or Scott Adams that well And so a little bit of introduction and so I found some video clips that I where I think he Quite nicely summarizes his position This one from Stefan Molyneux, I thought was one of the clearest I thought was one of the clearest articulations So to speak is when you start talking about the human brain use the quote the human brain is not capable of comprehending truth at a deep Level now I need to bring this up. Obviously people are gonna read this and say Steph Why didn't you bring this up now? Of course some of you out there know who Stefan Molyneux is He's a controversial figure. He's a Canadian. He's he he He promotes himself as an Aristotelian as a rationalist and and so he's he's big as And again, I don't I haven't watched much Molyneux So I don't really know how to categorize him and categorizing him is little dicey as I know from a previous video that I've done But he so but he's really big into reason and so this is what kind of makes Scott Adams an interesting Person to talk to with respect to that because Adams has a different take up and it's a fair It's a fair point because of course, that's my you know philosophy thing is is trying to aim at that as significantly as possible, but make the case for For this approach to understanding the human mind and how it operates relative to reality Well, so I start with what I'd call the hypnotist view of the world So the normal view of the world is that we're rational creatures 90% of the time and we all recognize that Oh 10% of the time we get a little crazy But it's mostly other people doesn't happen to me so much the hypnotist reverses that completely and says we are an irrational species who Rationalizes after the fact and by the way science largely backs that up There are a number of studies showing that their reason and logic and facts don't really change people's minds the way we assume they should But people are really great at rationalizing why they did the irrational thing that they did So once you understand that's the normal way the world works And by the way, you can't even be a hypnotist unless you understand that because nothing else would make sense Then you then you ask yourself. Well, how could we be in this situation? How could we have built these great civilization Civilizations and you know gotten to this point where the where the ruling species if we're not rational. Well, here's the thing Evolution didn't care if you understood it only cared if you made more of yourself The the the bar for evolution is really low. Did you make more of yourself? success Did you not you failed and we were able to make more of ourselves? Even though you and I could have a complete disagreement on let's say this point, right? Or or you could have a different religion, which is like living in a different reality You could think that the president of the United States is a monster ready to destroy the world I could think he's a populist who's got some policies you don't like but he's basically harmless So we're living in completely different interpretations of reality and I would argue that that's the normal case Not the exception and once you understand it as normal it changes how you see everything and do everything and I go further and say that you can predict the future better by Assuming that people are irrational than you can if you believe they're rational and I set that as my test and it was the reason that I predicted so publicly and consistently at least until posse gate anyway that President Trump or candidate Trump would become president because I believe that this notion of people as irrational and Easily persuaded would be more predictive than any set of facts and fact-checking you could put together So let's talk about them. So Yeah, so there's a lot there's a lot in there and I I actually agree with Scott Adams on that point that people are are not very rational they're certainly not 90% rational and as As Adam says he goes on with Mala Neale and Mala Neale will make the point that when he was in high school he was debating and someone would make a joke and everyone liked the person who made the joke and so we're we're biased to agree with that person's point and Mala Neale was was annoyed and upset by that because he had reason on his Side and and and you see this perpetually on YouTube with with all the rationality channels here We have the reason this is this is this is how how we are so, you know This is how everyone's going to believe now. Now what's really important to understand when it comes to reason is that it is Reason attempts to transcend Subjectivity and individuality. It's it's an attempt to Be able to create communities around a common in a sense Objective criteria and this is where I get into my monarchical vision reason imagines that we can transcend our individuality our subjectivity and we can see the world clear-eyed and and if in fact We can do this if I have this capacity and you have this capacity Then you and I can be on the same page because we will see the world clearly math works the same for everyone even though people Have a hard time with math You know so on and so forth. This is the project of rationality This is the this is the dream of rationality and we might even say that behind it is the motivation of Rationality well what might by that motivation be well if we look at the story of the Tower of Babel I Think I think in some ways the story of the Tower of Babel could be understood as a story about rationality because the descendants of Noah Congregate on the plane and and in a sense Rationality is this tower that we build up into the sky in order to be able to see down on the world And now we can ask a question about motivation in order to control the world because he who can predict has a tremendous power to anticipate and therefore control Same same thing goes with with argumentation and reason the the idea behind Reason and argumentation is that if I can lay things out in a rational way for you I can convince you and this then gets into Scott Adams big point that he keeps making over and over again is the power of persuasion that emotion and motivation are far more potent persuaders of people than reason is reason is itself actually fairly weak when it comes to motivating people and Political campaigns know this this is this is part of the reason negative advertising nobody wants to be seen as doing negative advertising, but everyone does it because people are quite often Persuaded and motivated by fear More than altruism fear is a terribly strong motivator and again you get into Jordan Peterson stuff when he does his future authoring program He tries to harness both the desire for a preferred outcome by writing your preferred future but also writing your Your hellish future if you don't achieve your goals and so in that way Peterson tries to marshal both our Attractive nature and and also our repulsive nature that we motivate by desire and fear and and so Adams here his you know I find his I Find his anthropology in this sense You know not too far in disagreement with my own the in Romans 1 for example the Apostle Paul says We suppress the truth by our desires We are we have a hard time finding the truth. We have a hard time seeing the truth We have our hard time maintaining the truth and what I want you to hear behind Scott Adams, I think both in this video I think I've decided to turn this into two videos because there's a lot of material especially waiting when we get into set Sam Harris talking to Scott Adams because they have a political a pretty strong political Disagreement between the two of them even though both of them begin from the same premise Which is that we are an evolved creature who has a who has you know in terms of Darwin evolved towards this Certain outcome Peterson shares this they're all in that sense Darwinian in their narrative now Peterson will take on Harris and that's gonna be very interesting conversation this summer between the two of them, but So Scott Adams comes in here and it's in some ways Scott Adams acts like he's the greatest skeptic of them all because he is the one that most emphasizes our Susceptibility to all of the corruptions of reason that we find so common Now what's really interesting and this comes through in a recent video? Adams does a a Twitter a Twitter periscope daily or almost daily and then some YouTube channels pick this up So if you want to go through and see some old ones, but he has this theory of two movies and here he's He's jumping into the conversation between John Legend and Kanye West with respect to You know should Kanye warm up to Trump or should? Kanye Side with the other tribe that says Trump is a monster Trump is a devil Trump is a racist We should all with one voice denounce Trump and if you're not denouncing Trump with us Then you're part of the enemy. This is the basic tribalism that is at work within our political process and And I and a tweet recently I said, you know Trump is in a sense He's like a glue trap because I find people on the right and the left It's almost Trumpological possession because I Find people can't not talk about Trump and so with all my friends on the left I often encourage them to You know, you don't have anything you're gonna be able to do until the next election So see if you can stop reacting because he wants all this attention and he's he takes all the oxygen out of the room Don't don't give him so much attention but the the left just can't leave him alone and then this sets up this tribal dynamic of You know the left feels themselves the victims because of Trump the right feels themselves the victims because of the left and then each of them indulges their victim status and uses that as the justification for Whatever it is that they wish to Well, you did what was reprehensible first and so that then justifies the reprehensible things that I'll do Well, this is this is the way that we tear down our institutions because we say well you broke the rules So now I can break the rules too. And this is behavior from our childhood This is behavior from the playground and we'll see this food fight happening right now in the public space base because you hear it with respect to the I didn't watch the the White House Correspondents dinner, but apparently there was a comedian there who was pretty Was pretty rough on Trump and so then this was actually on the Sunday morning talk shows and Then and then the the right says see see how you are and the left says ah, but Trump started it And it's like well, this is isn't isn't this what you see when you take care of children Can't we good above that well Scott Adams would say well This is exactly consistent with what we would expect from human beings. All right So so he's working on Kanye and and John John legend Kanye tweeted some things at Trump and Trump Responded positively and John let John legend says hey. Hey, so, you know stay away from here and And this is this is how this is how Scott Adams looks at the situation Now The normal world as you know is it's quite Common. In fact, it's universal. It's not just common. It's the universal way the human human people look at things human people Now Adams has you can see on his screen He's got this this to me movie theories and this basically says that there's There's we see things out there and we interpret it in two separate narratives Now now within that you might notice. Well, okay, so we see a common set of facts Yeah, there's some there's obviously always some selection in the facts But for the sake of clarity for his demonstration of his two new movie theory, this is what he'll talk about human beings We have lots of confirmation bias and lots of cognitive dissonance and we imagine that we're rational creatures, but we're not Now if you said to both these people hey, hey John legend have you heard of these concepts? cognitive dissonance and confirmation bias I'll bet both of them would say yes and that they would know essentially what those mean and that they're common things. I think Kanye might be a step ahead in the sense that Even if you know what these things are there's a second trap And the trap is that you believe that these are the things that happen to other people and That's exactly right. It's a second trap and The difficulty is do we ever escape the second trap in other words if you can be the seer if you can be Paul VanderKlay or Scott Adams or Jordan Peterson or Sam Harris and you can stop and in a sense Transcend the conversation by saying well, let's pull out of the scrum right now and get above it and recognize What we're doing. Well, we've got some we've got some confirmation bias going here We've got some cognitive dissonance that I think Scott Adams is exactly right What happened when Trump was elected that through the American left was just whoosh and my favorite? My favorite treatment of that was Saturday Night Live's Little Brooklyn campaign party with I forget the comedian's name who was in it and He had all these white folks watching and then I can't I think of his name and then the comedian who's African-american You know what, you know, Chris Rock was in there and I can't I think of the other guy's name It'll show up in the comment section. Trust me You know, it's like oh, well, there's racism in America You know, I I thought that would I thought that sketch just just nailed it perfectly But but Adams is right, you know, just because you see this there's a second trap which says that Well, this is what other people do now. The funny thing is is that of course even if you see this trap, it doesn't mean you are immune to it because Actually if you if you take a look at a little bit later in the Mala new interview Scott Adams has to explain to Mala new why he switched sides so often during the election says of Trump to Hillary to Johnson to Trump to I don't know Marvin the Martian I think was thrown in the mix at some point So what was the process and I was really really struck by how dangerous it became for you I wasn't quite aware of of where you were in the Nazi pantheon for people Yeah So I started out writing about just the topic of persuasion But that was very heavily biased toward Trump because he had the good game So I was writing more about what he was doing right that made people say you're a Trump supporter and where I live in Northern, California That's physically dangerous. So I did lose, you know the majority of my friends and my Facebook feed is very very lonely right now and There were people not far from where I live who were literally being beaten leaving Trump rallies just just for being on that side and so There were times I would not be able to speak if I thought I was overheard, etc So it got so dangerous that people online and social media were calling me Joseph Goebbels or gobbles However, you pronounce it Hitler's, you know main PR person and if you're being called Hitler or Hitler's henchmen and people are believing it not in a in a Exaggerated way, but they believe this this candidate that you seem to be supporting is actually going to bring Hitler like Policies to the world you do have moral authority to physically kill that person Yeah, so Once people fought the thought they had moral authority to kill Hitler or his henchmen And I think that people were actually starting to think it was okay to punch a Nazi For example, you would see that on social media. I backed I publicly said I endorsed Clinton for my safety and even though that's not a real reason and even though people recognized it wasn't a political statement It was it was just the sort of thing that people say in public for for whatever purpose. It was good enough People said alright, we'll go bother other people and so the pressure almost immediately came off me and it wasn't until the pussy gay thing That or actually it was it wasn't until Clinton said that she wanted to You know increase the the death tax to what would have been effectively a 75% Tax on every new dollar I earned because most of that would have been taxed at 50% and then another 50% when I died And that was just it felt like confiscation that that was one topic. I could understand there was no complexity to it I was earning money just to give it away and that I couldn't live with that. So for for a few weeks I endorsed Candidate Trump before that reason alone and I also hated the bullying the amount of bullying I was getting online because the the the Trump the Trump haters was just through the roof It was just insane and I have sort of a trigger for bullies. I always have it It's just the one thing that sets me off like like nothing else and I tend to get aggressive in those situations Now now pay attention here to his motivations His motivations are as we would expect from a materialist completely constructed he Was you know first interested in Trump because of the persuasion element and he was talking about him But then he's getting group pressure Peer pressure from other people in Northern California where I live too I think he's probably closer to the closer to the coast probably in the Bay Area or maybe I don't know where he lives But you know, he's getting he's getting pressure he's probably had always been identified more with the left in some ways even though he was a You know, it was pretty pretty determined capitalist But so that so so that pressure then changed his mind he came out and said well support Hillary But then there's taxes and and Hillary and her plan would take away his money and then he's you know Now he's got a problem with that. So Okay. So what what is truth? Well, does truth have any does truth have any bearing on preference? is Is an election a contest of who do you think would be a better president for the country or? Or Who do you think would be a better? President for me. Well, maybe I'm gonna bring in Peterson here. We'll see how this goes so, you know right away you have this question of truth and this question of reality and Then you would have the question. Well Who would be a better president for me in the long run? How do I know what will happen if Hillary gets elected or how do I know what will happen? If donald trump gets elected and and I think we can pretty easily say we don't know But so, you know, he continues on this instead of defensive. So I just said well screw it I I don't want to have my money stolen on my deathbed and I don't like these bullies I'll support the president all of all of these reasons and and they're Are they rational? Are they emotional? Well, how can you separate that for the candidate trump for president? And it wasn't until pussygate that I said, okay, i'm gonna temporarily back johnson because As far as I know he only touches himself and that seemed like a a far safer endorsement So so here we have the ethical the ethical motivation and So well, how do how do ethics come into this? well now we're now things are getting really complicated and you know the The project for well, we'll get we'll get to we'll get to scott adams project a little bit and his filter idea But you know right away What was supposed to be such a clear thing about truth and bias and how people are well scott adams who's been telling us about this and I You know, I agree with a lot of what he's saying here in terms of people are full of biases people are full of All of these things. Well, well, how can we know truth? Well, this this gets difficult So then he was for comes out for hillary to get pressure off and then she's going to take his money So he comes out for trump, but then there's pussygate. So then he goes for johnson, but that didn't last once once the the pussygate story You know came down in priority a little bit and people so so again, it's peer pressure because you know when when he's reading the tribe and when when this this This video comes out and trump is, you know talking about when you're high status You can grab women and they'll let you get away with it. They'll let you do whatever because you're high status This is reprehensible. This is morally reprehensible scott adams says and so i'm off trump But then he looks around he gathers the signals from everyone and says Well, don't maybe it isn't so morally reprehensible and so Okay. Now now again, I think in some ways adams is more consistent even in this than I hear sometimes from let's say stephan mollinue or or sam harris that this is because when it comes to ethics often again, we like to Imagine we are transcending these motivations and in fact even in public this Flip-flopping that scott adams did we count as a strike against him morally? and in fact we um We respect if he takes a moral stand at the cost of his friends now this is a really interesting dynamic because So often on one hand we gauge morality by what everyone else thinks is moral And this is a powerful thing that happens on the other hand We gauge morality when everyone else is against them because then we say aha I don't see a natural implicitly corrupt motivation for this decision He must be making this because of reason Because of some higher good because of some higher value because of some higher knowledge and again pay attention to the language this is reason as sort of a tower of babel So so so this goes on and um, but now jump a little bit ahead to um To scott adams talking about a a podcast a sam harris podcast and now Trump has won um scott adams lost a lot of friends, but he's getting a lot of other attention. I'm sure he lost a lot of Speaking gigs financially. I don't know how this settled out for him But again, it's interesting the way we evaluate this If his if he lost a lot of money because his support for trump We score this in the positive moral category often because we say aha. He's standing up for his beliefs at great cost Because we simply assume that if if you are making money with an idea Well, that's a moral corruption now again. My focus here is on this this natural debate between nature and reason And and we have these implicit biases with respect to them That if there's money involved or other motivations involved that undermines reason Well, what are we saying about reason when we say that now now let's hear a little bit of scott adams filter ideas Anyway, so my my point in all of this, of course i'll reiterate is that Uh humans are not really good at understanding base reality We all have our own little filters and those filters We don't know if they're right or wrong We never will but some filters are better at predicting and some some are better at making you happy If you think that trump is a monster that doesn't make you happy and if you think he's incompetent. Well, that doesn't predict What has happened so far because he got the nomination got the election And so far at the end of 2017 he's got a strong economy. He's got jobs He's he's ended trade deals. He's got judges. He's beaten isis in the field Uh, he's got rid of regulations Now what's important here is that he again outlines in a different format But it's pretty consistent with what what he's been saying and this if you go into almost any scott adams video He will give a little shorthand into Into his he'll lay out his framework here but pay attention We're bad at looking at looking at base reality, but within his system He he also assumes we have the capacity to do this outcome evaluation And say that well, you know beforehand You know i scott adams was able to pick trump. Well, yeah you did you flip-flopped a little bit, but that's okay I'll forgive you that you're human. We're we're all like this that doesn't that doesn't undermine your anthropology. Okay? Um, and so what we do is we have these two filters. We have this happiness filter and we have this outcome filter and so These are two valid filters by which we can Make judgments now now it's important To to recognize here that in some ways the happiness filter and the outcome filter are slightly different because the happiness filter is in a sense a a Moral argument and and it says that that happiness is a moral good and so a good in and of itself and so If I pick a filter that makes me happy well You know, that's that's justifiable Because happiness is a good in and of itself and then his second filter, which is which is an outcome filter Where we can successfully predict so so The happiness filter is kind of a good in of itself filter we are made for happiness and the the The outcome filter the predictive filter is a filter that helps us retune our truth now there might be some some fairly binary filters that we pay attention to for example if Because of trump's actions or to whatever extent trump participated in a hopeful A hopeful Resolution of the conflict in korea and the fear of a nuclear exchange You know if if if in the short term north and south korea reconcile If in the short term north and south korea reconcile north korea gets rid of its nuclear missiles China doesn't get upset at the possibility of reconciliation between north and south korea You know trump gets credit for that. Maybe trump wins a A noble prize for that. Well to the degree that trump participated in that You know, therefore he's a genius But but again, it's important to pay attention to what we're doing here because in a sense what we're doing is we're saying Well, we can't know truth So there's a happiness filter that we can use to say hey if it makes me happy that's justifiable And then there's a predictive filter But now let's pay a little more attention to that predictive filter what in a sense says is that via this predictive filter We can find out a little bit of truth And if we find out that little bit of truth, then we can pay attention here. We can take this truth Abstract it to a degree. Let's say we abstract it by saying trump is a smart man trump is a Trump is a genius and not a fool because that's kind of been the debate all along is is trump a manipulative genius or is trump an idiot and you will find Um the left you'll find his critics playing both tunes and sometimes the right will come up and say hey, wait a minute Is he a fool or is he a genius? Um, is he evil or is he an idiot? Um, you know, you can't have both so so in a sense Scott adams wants to say well if we find You know trump has done a bunch of good things and then he basically says in earlier videos if at the start of 2018 Most people are gonna say wow everything is going great Yeah, but pay attention. We're having to put that we're we're making this judgment within time and These outcomes are by no means quite as discrete and obvious You know, for example in in the middle of the 19th century abraham lincoln Was was was not esteemed to any degree like ulysses s grant was If you look now back at both of them, of course abraham lincoln at least in the In mo in many parts of the united states and other parts of the world is considered this great genius and this great hero And ulysses s grant is a bit of a sad story, you know struggles with alcohol, you know Good in marriage a lot of corruption in his administration And so now if you say grant and lincoln as presidents, well, they look very different all of our views are within the stream and so which Leads us again exactly into the motivation for this privileged vision of reason a monarchical vision that is outside of time it is outside of subjectivity Objectivity where we can make claims where we can pass judgment That in fact will be eternal and as i've mentioned before with my other videos where I talk about this monarchical vision We're in a sense talking about a godlike thing and But this is where things get weird too because this monarchical vision is in itself Impersonal by design non-subjective the subjectivity has been taken out of it But we are persons and so when we attempt to strive for this monarchical vision when we attempt to strive for Objectivity we do so as personal beings who have will and desire and motivation And therefore we wish to take the fruit of this monarchical vision And in scott adams which would be this this little bit of truth that we could that we could pull out of the equation by virtue of having correctly predicted something and therefore we can employ it and and what and well Depends what the human heart wants to do and this gets back into we can employ it in terms of The power of my vision of the world Coming to pass having the power having the influence having the power of persuasion to persuade the world according to how I see it Well, so now we get back again to the basic question Is there really one world or is a world how I see it and can we know and and so in a sense? C.S. Lewis makes this point about seeing through you see through things in order to see something if you just keep seeing through All that you're left ironically with is the subjective Now again scott adams says most people just add post-hoc rationalization does this really have we really escaped that with this argument because Well evaluate trump's presidency here at the end of april beginning of may 2018 His You know his favorable ratings are in the 40s Who knows he might say well, you can't evaluate it until the end of his term and you wonder well When will the end of his term be will he will he make it all four years? Will the midterm swing I mean we don't we don't know these things. We can't answer these things and and scott scott adams says Well, you know, well I predicted it. Well, okay good for you and um And I forget, you know the the one website, you know a lot of other websites predicted The game of prediction is interesting now if we bring jordan peterson into this which i'll do in my next video when I get into Some of the q and a things about well, how can we how can we get past our perceptions? And it'll be interesting because peterson will bring subjectivity back in because Just as scott adams did naturally at the pussy gate thing scott adams pulls back because he's got this rational He's got this this ethical This ethical filter and he says well Maybe trump is unethical Okay, and this of course will be the big debate between he and sam harris is trump unethical and Round and round they'll go Both of them are unethical Um Both of these Now we get back into c.s. Lewis naturalism and knowledge and and lewis in his book miracles says There are really two perspectives here one says that the naturalist says that everything is the whole show the naturalist says that Along with scott adams that were 90% irrational and 10% rational, but even the rational is a function of the natural And and this is this is it's right at that moment that people have a hard time understanding lewis because That's exactly where lewis begins to poke and says Where does that finally leave us and If that is so Can there be a monarchical vision because lewis will actually say that the degree to which we use reason Reason is a degree to which we To which we touch to which we experience to which we inhabit to which we practice the supernatural And now to put on a jordan peterson pragmatic hat that's how we all act We act like Reason is privileged Uh stephen molyneux does it sam harris does it rationality rules dude does it scott adams does it jordan peterson does it paul vanderkley does it In fact if you if you run this idea down There's just a a piece of jona goldberg's Um newest book he's got a he's got a segment of it in the national review You know he he's arguing in a sense that since Descartes and loch since the enlightenment We have ramped up our capacity for rationality We have ramped up our capacity to have this monarchical vision. We have in a sense Built the tower of babel and it has worked now jordan peterson comes along and says but Worked for how long you see because at the beginning what you do when you deal with rationality in this way is you take out the subjective and by Taking out the subjective you want it to be trans subjective in other words to be true of every human being You also take out the temporal you take out time And and you say this therefore is eternal. Well again now we're kind of knocking on Greek notions of divinity now now Hebrew, you know athens and jerusalem hebrew ideas of god greek ideas of god in many ways christianity has has some of both as does as does Judaism as does islam There's a lot going on there and again, you can you can listen to philip carrey's Uh audio book great courses series on on philosophy and religion and he I think he walks through that quite nicely as he goes through the early stages of Of the development of christian theology, but you know pay attention to what we're doing. So then c.s. Lewis comes in here basically and says This is the game we're all playing And we should be honest about this game because naturalists all and and lewis says and you know This is why I pick this argument to engage the naturalists because they They cannot give they cannot give up reason they default to it scott adams himself who is fully aware of the second trap Falls into it Just like we all do And and so scott adams on one hand wants to say This is how we are and this is part of the reason I appreciate scott adams because he's he's being a very thorough going Naturalist but a lot of the other naturalists are getting very annoyed by him Because scott adams is just further on that spectrum down towards full-blown skepticism But it's really hard to live there because scott adams believes he has something to contribute So he does youtube videos As do I and so, you know Actually scott adams does periscopes, but there's you know Lewis says but we all recognize corruption by motivation. We all recognize corruption by physical or physiological Intervention if I get drunk, I don't reason so well if i'm tired. I don't reason so well if i'm angry I don't reason so well and then we talk about you know These reptilian part of our brains and these more developed part of our brains If you know corruption by individual limitations, maybe one is smarter than the other maybe one just Their their brain is work so that their emotions aren't integrated we'll get into that when we look at some of peterson's videos in the question and answer corruption by peer pressure we saw that with with With scott adams and he keeps flipping sides on on who who he's endorsing And well now you might say well he kept flipping sides, but he always felt trump would win But that's not exactly true because with with pussy gait he thought oh this is gonna this is gonna sink trump So i'm gonna pull back away from him. Well, what's what motivations going on in your mind there? Well, it's a very common motivation that you want to be on the winning side Well, why do you want to be on the winning side and I forgot to unplug the phone? Um, I forgot to unplug the phone because often I forget to plug back in the phone um, but this is this is what we're doing and so lewis says This is the game that we play and all of the naturalist. He knows play this game, too So again reason is used to transcend corruption and filters Lewis sees this as a witness to the supernatural it attempts to see truth by establishing an objective Subjectively eliminating with time and individuality Perspective the monarchical vision in a sense the tower reason as the tower of babel and the goal of this is in many ways human agreement Because as jonathan height Continues to stress Multiple brains are better than smart one brain. Well, how can multiple brains Think together. Well again now we're seeing how useful reason is because Multiple brains might be feeling um differently well This again gets into the question persuasion because well actually you can make a whole You it's easier to make a whole group of people feel the same way Then it is easy to make a whole group of people Think the same way But what you recognize is making everyone feel the same way has some utility, but what's it serving? it's usually serving either reason or emotion in whatever leader is doing the The Doing the persuading and then we get back into the question of well, what are the goals of that leader? what's a very rationalist question because and then you can see that the constant tension between These two parts of ourself and you know, let me get back into the peterson stuff Well, we're gonna have to talk about the two hemispheres of the brain and i've been doing a lot of thinking about his His conversation with mcgill quest and mcgill chris McGill something Talked about the hemispheres of the brain but basically in that video they get into some process theology and I think we're gonna have to talk about process and human beings at some point but you know, this is this is where I think scott adams is is helpful and and comes into the conversation and Because now we're adding different elements. So we have jordan all jordan peterson scott adams um sam harris These are all you know darwinian in the sense that we're coming from below in terms of human evolution but but adams is kind of the skeptical and he's also the outlier because You'll hear in the if you listen to and i'd recommend listening to it's a very interesting podcast a little long But the podcast with sam harris and scott adams And and the podcast devolves now i haven't heard a lot of sam harris, but the podcast kind of devolves into Trump possession where where trump just takes over the podcast like trump seems to take over um take over the news cycle he takes over the minds of the minds of especially the left right now Trump just takes over everything Um, it's all trump all the time Which is why sometimes I say he shall not be named because even just naming Naming him, you know Gets into the gets into the conversation. I suppose if I want to put trump in the title of this I'll get a lot of views, but whatever so I'm going to do another video because I want to take scott adams now that i've done this introduction About who he is and how he thinks and how he's kind of on the skeptical end of the materialistic Of the materialist naturalist and someone who I think is Is trying to embody that which I think makes him one of the best illustrations of why that can't be embodied because I think finally If you if you become a thoroughgoing naturalist You actually have to become Impersonal I I think you have to figure out how to embody the loss of your personhood And and so eventually as we go through lewis's book we're going to begin to see the connection between naturalism and pantheism Because what's the problem in this mix? Is the personal and and so then when lewis begins to sketch out the relationship between Humanity and nature you're going to have a relationship between the personal and the impersonal because The personal always governs the impersonal And that's why lewis says you know nature and nature and reason nature and humanity are always at war because we colonize nature but nature has ways of subverting us and killing us and Undermining us and so on and so forth. So there's a little introduction to scott adams I'll be talking about scott adams more and Using some of scott adams stuff in conjunction with sam harris and jordan peterson because I think again, this is where peterson gets very interesting because peterson owns some of these things I think better than adams or harris And again showing my biases I think actually cs lewis anticipated most of this now now lewis isn't a pragmatist like peterson is but lewis walked through so many of these arguments in the 40s and 50s and has them in his books and And these are actually the reasons that that lewis became a christian. So
