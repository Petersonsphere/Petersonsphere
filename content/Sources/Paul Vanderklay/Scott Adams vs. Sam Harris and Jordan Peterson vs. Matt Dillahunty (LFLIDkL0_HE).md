 Hi, this is Paul and I'm gonna continue talking about Scott Adams and Sam Harris and I'm gonna get some ditto Honte and Peterson in here too in his last Question and answer video. So yeah, I trim my beard I'm not wearing my own shirt but I did a video on Scott Adams and and I've this is continuing to roll around in my head I've had a bunch of other things going on as you can see I had did some conversations and some of my my previous videos It was fascinating listening to the Scott Adams Sam Harris Conversation because that conversation seemed to basically revolve around Donald Trump and I love how Sam Harris Entitled it triggered because I think Scott Adams triggered Sam Harris in that video and basically the whole video became a conversation about You know whether Trump is a con man or whether Trump is this master persuader who's leading America in a great direction and America's gonna start winning again and and In fact, you can find plenty of Scott Adams predictions that by the beginning of 2018 At some point, you know all of all of this masterful stuff that Donald Trump is doing is gonna come true and This this gets into Scott Adams to movie theory Which again if you watch his periscopes you can find all over the place Scott Adams basically makes a postmodern argument in In this and says, you know, we have all these facts and we try to figure out you know what they what they line up with and Because we can't know things very clearly because we're really terrible at connecting with reality you know two legitimate filters that that Scott Adams always says is that one is happiness whichever movie makes you happy and Whichever you'll know truth when you can predict when your predictions come true and we talked about that I talked about it that in my last video about Scott Adams and so we fit facts into a larger narrative to a larger narrative structure in order to derive meaning and And that's that's pretty basic stuff. So Harris says Trump is a con man. Adam says he's a super persuader now Now Adams wrestles with the the epistemologic The epistemic epistemic epistemological. Let's use epistemological dilemma of naturalism in this and and Adams one of the reasons I got interested in Adams is that in terms of naturalist he more than most would own up to the Difficulties of naturalism and he he owns up to them quite fully in many of his explanations I think he along with many other naturalists has a real hard time living them out But you know, he's he's owning up to them more than most which is you know, which I think are points in his favor And and so Adams has has two filters Because we live in a soup of our constructed selves can't fully escape from that's the filter of happiness Live in the movie that makes you happy and the filter of outcomes We we can know we are seeing at least to a degree the objective world when our predictions come true now One of the pushbacks I would give on that is that when we have to evaluate Predictions we're still in the same soup as we were before we made the prediction in other words if our capacity to Interpret reality is compromised by our naturalism it is compromised both when we are the in the moment we are trying to make a prediction and in the moment we are trying to evaluate if our prediction came true and we see this all the time in political games because every in every political moment the Politician is reinterpreting the past in favor of the argument they are putting forward towards the future. So both sides are seeing the other side through their tribal filters and what's very difficult and frustrating and a polarized political atmosphere is that People are seldom willing to Concede points to the other side now. We also know this is part of a game So this gets incorporated into the process and we say oh well, they're conceding So that gives them more points that gives them more credibility and the game goes on and on but are they conceding enough points? So and for example the racism debate Okay, so you're saying that racism exists good. So you're not a horrible racist But unless you agree that your your white privilege has so fully compromised you that you know on and on and that's how this That's how this this whole game gets played Well, how will the Trump debate be settled Adams again and again says well no in time because Trump will be vindicated by outcomes And again, if you go past if you go into how many of Adams past videos He will say again and again and it's been fun now that Trump's been in office a little while We're past some of these moments. And so of course Trump skeptics will say am I winning yet? I'm not tired of winning yet Trump believers will say you just have to wait He's working his process and and even in that when you listen to Scott Adams Talk about Talk about the present we're living in now Scott Adams interprets the present in other words the evaluation move of his predictive Strategy for knowing the truth the the interpretive move of that Criticizing the truth Critics will already say You know, you're seeing Trump through your rose-colored glasses. You had ego and Reputational stakes on getting the call, right? So now even if many people say well, you know the economy You know, we're not really at 4% We're not seeing this this great new change that we were promised I'm not tired of winning yet that the call always goes out Call always goes out will give it more time and in other words time will vindicate Trump and now this is Basic to to human existence and a little while later I think we're gonna talk about why this is basic for human existence when we get into a little bit of phenomenology Both Harris and Adams can agree that time will tell they will both say that but how much time and will it be within their lifetimes and you know, this is where This is why it's telling that whenever we have Conversations about reason and naturalism We get into arguments similar to the the woman who believes her husband is having an affair and so she kills herself Doesn't that doesn't you know evaporate the world. We're not solipsists here You always have the problem with time will tell if you're a naturalist you're not going to be around to have time tell you and Given the fact that we're still debating FDR or Abraham Lincoln or Thomas Jefferson None of us are going to have enough time to tell in other words we we despite this system of of reason and fact based observation despite this system We never really achieve what this entire system is intended to deliver And that is seldom talked about in naturalism Conversations that that this system about facts and reason is not only intended to deliver truth But it's intended to deliver truth within communities. And in fact, it's intended and hoped to deliver universal truth so that any Honest person. Well, there you have the problem right away. I right away you're saying well, they're being dishonest if they were being honest They would acknowledge my point. Oh, well, they're compromised. They're not smart enough to see my point Oh, and and you just just listen to the arguments based on facts and reason And all the usual ways it falls apart. They will quickly come up I was listening to the Sam Harris As recline debate and here again, so here you have what I assume to be two Rational individuals neither of them seems to be a Christian So they're not possessed by this this this superstition that possesses all of us Christians You have two rational people to civilized people two people who are both speaking English two people who have access to an unprecedented number of facts two people who in fact are Debating Conversations that they have had with each other so they were both within those Conversations and they still can't come to agreement even on facts Never mind, you know this ideal that within reason and facts two of us will be able to agree and agree Sufficiently so that we can live and act together now this move into action is an important one as we get into Deeper into some of the Jordan Peterson stuff So we have Adams and Harris both are materialist naturalist. They are shared system reason isn't yielding the agreement They are both imagined ethics is self-evident I'm gonna play a little clip from from from Adams on that and they both can't agree whether or not Trump's ethics are good. Now, this is important because You know, I haven't I haven't dabbled. I haven't gotten back into miracles yet But it's right at this point in CS Lewis's argument in terms of the development of this series of videos that that Lewis is asking the question can naturalism Yield ethics and this in fact is a huge debate and this is where Jonathan Heights work comes up with his Moral taste buds. This is where Jordan Peterson's work comes in with his with kind of his Jungian our Our ethics and our morality comes at us from below because you know, even rats learn to play fair This is where Sam Harris comes in with his attempt to say this is how we can have a system Without without God. This is how we can see that that morality is a natural is it is a development of natural process If we ask those questions and we ask well, why? Why would it be advantageous for us to realize that morality is a system a universal transcultural system derived from natural processes The hope is that all of us human beings sharing the same evolutionary path then can come up finally with a thorough going system of morality Where all of us will agree on the rules and what's more all of us will follow the rules if we're being rational none of this ever really gets at the question of Why aren't people reasonable and actually if again when we get back to CS Lewis CS Lewis makes the point that there is a great degree of commonality within laws and at the end of the abolition of man CS Lewis goes through that and He says everyone seems to be able to agree on the laws and no one seems to be able to follow them fully And that's in fact how he begins mere Christianity so and we see this being played out with Adams and Harris because even though Adams and Harris seem to Share fundamentally the same framework. We don't have Harris and Adams debating the existence of God We don't have Harris and Adams debating the the truth of Darwin We don't even have Harris and Adams debating whether or not reason works now Adams is more skeptical than Harris but Because Adams acts in the world and we're gonna get into this again Because this is where Peterson comes into the art that comes into the conversation Because Adams acts in the world He actually every time he needs to act to a certain degree He Sort of betrays the system, but what we see even with Harris and Adams is they can't come to agreement When I work from home I always have to plug in my ethernet because I got I got fiber at home, which is wonderful for uploading YouTube's but the AT&T Router they've given me is kind of crappy. I'm still trying to figure all that out. So let's play a little bit of Scott Adams on ethics here He has a point about your lack of ethical discussion this this is someone criticizing Scott Adams played a video where Sam Harris and another person are criticizing Scott Adams and his lack of ethics when it comes to Trump because Adam says You know, we're seeing at least two movies with respect to Trump now I think my movie is plausible if not, right Harris says no, he's a modernist in that sense there's only one movie and the facts line up that Trump is a con man and So there must be some deficiency with you Scott Adams for not seeing the truth and that's that's basically how now modernist Naturalism goes no, he doesn't Here's the thing You you all have a sense of ethics and they're probably no different than mine Because we have ethics are pretty pretty uniform across societies Right. Whatever you think of Trump's, you know honesty his ethics how he's treated women Probably very similar to how Trump supporters see him But Trump supporters apparently are just dealing with more variables And the the ethical considerations Are certainly on the table and we should each fully Appreciate them so that they can be weighed good and bad and it's just part of your decision now personally as I often say I would lie to a terrorist to save your child's life But lying is bad So sometimes the world gives you hard choices with lots of variables and If having a president Trump who's got some rough edges shall we say? Gets you a far better result for society in the world, you know gives you a better economy makes people happier I can put up with some of the fact-checking being problematic But that doesn't change the fact That if we could get all of those things without the fact-checking being wrong I'd be in favor of it. Just like you the there's a childlike View of the world that goes like this The the child view is the president does some things. I don't like Therefore he should not be our president He should not be our president You know, he says some things that we don't think are true He doesn't have priorities we like etc That's that's sort of a child's version of the world Because the thing is we don't have an option of the president Trump who can do all the good things. He's doing Without the rough edges that person didn't run There was no candidate like that. We only had a choice of Hillary Clinton things being similar to the way they've been or President Trump With lots of rough average rough edges who was going to break stuff and then maybe you know Ideally fix it better, which is largely what we're seeing So if you can't deal with more than one variable you probably shouldn't be talking about politics at all It's a it's a multi variable situation Now now this this was a little interesting talk on the part of Adams because when I think about modernists and postmodernists, I often I often think that in the in the final analysis postmodernist sheet they You can't you can't help when it comes time to taking action and speaking is a form of action when it comes time to taking action You got to choose and you got to figure out what to say and so even though Scott Adams is more Postmodern than Sam Harris Scott. I'm says wow, there's two there's two There's two movies being played and you can fit these in in the end Scott Adams when it comes down to his action Becomes a modernist and says finally, I think those who are saying that Trump is a leader He's got some rough edges. He's got some flaws But finally if you look at all the variables those who are looking at more of the variables variables will see the world like I do and and now this This business about multiple valid variables or Trump cards or or other things when it comes to political conversations is always an ongoing conversation and One of the things that we love to do when political gaming is expose the other side of the world Expose the others expose the hypocrisy of the other side. So for example with with evangelicals during the Clinton administration Bill Clinton with the Monica Lewinsky business He in a sense defiled and of course, Jonathan Haidt would jump all over that that sacred language he defiled the White House with with what he did with Monica Lewinsky and Now we love to expose the evangelicals when now a whole bunch of them are are continuing to back Trump and now This is this is this is not a religious debate at all between Scott Adams and Sam Harris because you know, neither of them are religious individuals. Neither of them have this supposed liability of believing in a superstition and they can't agree on Trump and so here in a sense got Adams Implicitly says of Sam Harris Sam Harris isn't seeing enough variables and that's kind of a sidewise way of Saying well, I see better I see clearer I can see the truth better than you when I look at all of the facts Sam Harris isn't looking at enough facts the movie that I finally believe is that's the true movie and now maybe I'm gonna put all kinds of conditions on that because I also want to maintain my reputation as a Naturalist with a high value of skepticism that we as human beings have do a terrible job of seeing reality So on and so forth. That's that's pretty much where that thing lands now this is where Jordan Peterson comes into the conversation and It gets very interesting because and let's use Trump as the test yesterday on Facebook I made a comment that I'm in my I'm in my third stage of Figuring out how to deal with Donald Trump To to a certain degree. I I was as Scott Adams said it with With cognitive dissonance when he was elected. I was I was quite surprised and then I went to my glue trap phase where I really tried to avoid saying the man's name because all of my friends on Facebook and in other places boy once you mention the guy's name the conversation just the capacity for conversation just evaporates People get polarized right away right away If you if you don't love Trump you don't love your country and you're you're a victim of ideological possession if you do love Trump you're a bigot and The reason that the world is evil and you know, I'm not ready to put up camps But but given this I'm considering it, you know concentration camps for everyone who loves to you know back and forth and black and forth and then of course Which is part of the reason why I appreciated Jordan Peterson's question in the Bill Maher thing You know, what are you gonna do with the other side? Please think about that. These are people and Hey, I'm in my 50s now and I remember plenty of I Remember plenty of polarized situations. I remember debating Ronald Reagan debating Bill Clinton debating George W Bush Debating the Iraq war, you know on and on and on and on this is a dynamic that happens So so Peterson comes in and says well, okay, let's well, let's use Trump as the test. Well, what can we know? well, what can we agree on and Really it comes down to how do you act? Do you speak in favor of Donald J? Trump do you denounce Donald J Trump? Will you vote? How will you vote? Will you protest? Will you donate to Donald J Tom 2020 campaign because you know right after the inauguration he started campaigning right away Now I want to bring in Dilla Honte because I should have put up I should have put up Let me see if I can find it. Okay, and The author of this piece. Oh shoot. I forgot his name You know Tyler yeah Tyler with an O Tyler lovin's He there's another really good piece two good pieces about Jordan Peterson on this website reason revolution I think they're both written by Tyler my disappointment with the Matt Dilla Honte Jordan Peterson discussion and I thought this was a this was a this was a this this guy this guy obviously is a good handle on on philosophy and and and I've and I've appreciated both of the both of the things that I read too and and my We just we actually discussed this at our last meetup Yeah, I was disappointed with this conversation too, and I haven't Dilla Honte now has a video out where he talks about his disappointment with this conversation I haven't listened to that one yet. I look forward to it, but In a sense when I when I saw this this conversation between these two I Wasn't surprised for the same reason I wasn't surprised that there was a lot of anticipation about Jordan Peterson talking to William Lane Craig and they talked past each other and and I think I think the reason we've seen Jordan Peterson talk past William Lane Craig and Sam Harris and Matt Dilla Honte is Basically because of Peterson's phenomenology because Peterson has in a sense already see I don't want to say walked past because that Implies a progressivist narrative, but but Peterson has in a sense In terms of his lifespan, so I'm not I'm not implying a progressive a progressivist narrative here but Peterson in his lifetime has has isn't a materialist and he critiques materialism and He critiques materialism Really on the basis of Husserl now as I was telling my son yesterday The coolest thing about this whole YouTube experiment for me have been you the listeners Sometimes you folks send me stuff that just blows me away And you you know you blow up my book list and you you send me out and you find all this really cool stuff for me You are you are better than Google you really are and I was I was reading the Washington Post piece on Peterson this morning and just looking at the quality of the comments which was which was horrible and And thinking about the fact that you know once once you get to a certain place on the hierarchy You can't have a comment section because it just goes to pot with too much Too much of the crap that gets going and and so you know, I'm The weirdest youtuber around because I enjoy being small and because I You know before when I was reading comments I used to love every comment that was written and I thought I can't do this because you know so but but I do try to read all the comments and and boy that the positive and negative ones and Boy, do I learn a lot in the comment section from from listening to you guys and listening to you guys debate each other So so I too was disappointed in this conversation, but but in some ways this The way this conversation fell apart was so predictable Here's another little lesson about hierarchies and benefits My little YouTube channel is small enough that and and I don't get so many Emails and messages and invitations from people that that I can actually listen to most of you so You're not getting filtered out now I'm thinking about starting a patreon and I'm really debating that and I'll probably do a video just on that because I want to hear your comments, but What once you get to a certain level on a hierarchy you have to start filtering? I only have so many hours in a day. I have a family. I have a day job and And and so Whereas it would be tremendously fun to make videos all the time and have cool Conversations with people and and do all that stuff I don't have time and I don't have time to read every book that's recommended to me or or everything like this And so what happens is is you kind of let your internal motivation? This union internal cloud of witnesses decide. Okay, what am I gonna do next and what interests me now? And and then right now I'm really struggling with the question of how organized do I make myself and and how much do I let? Intuition work and so I'm doing a lot of thinking lately about time management so so how much time has Dilla hunty had to study Jordan Peterson and Since Jordan Peterson is further up on the hierarchy. He hasn't had any time to study Dilla hunty but if you want to have a good conversation Conversation The the more each other the better two people know each other the better conversation they can have with one another one of one of the one of one of you all Contacted me and wanted to have a conversation with me and we Skyped about some decisions in his life and He immediately got on the on the Skype and said oh, I just realized I know all kinds of things about you You don't know me at all and that's very true and I had the same Feeling when I was talking to Jordan Peterson and so I think part of the problem with this conversation is that between Peterson and Dilla hunty is that at this point in their lives neither of them have enough time to actually study each other and To to actually have a more productive conversation and it sounded from the beginning of this conversation that it was relatively Impromptu Dilla hunty was coming to Toronto So they moved a bunch of things around so Peterson could jump on stage because wouldn't this be cool and it just didn't work And I think we saw the same thing with William Lane Craig and Jordan Peterson. Excuse me Jordan Peterson, you know, he doesn't have time to study William Lane Craig and William Lane Craig doesn't have time to study Jordan Peterson and here You know little Paul Vanderkley in Sacramento, California I've been spending a lot of time studying Jordan Peterson and I really enjoy it because it's been fruitful for me and then I'm talking with you all and You know the room is that and this is the thing about rooms and I'm starting to deal with this in terms of our Jordan Peterson meetups in Sacramento because I want to have the right size the right number of people in the room so we can Have a productive conversation so we can learn we get this balance between order and chaos, right? Anyway back to the PowerPoint One of one of you and I'm not gonna name you because you sent it privately you didn't put in the comment section turn me on to this guy who I had never heard of and he's got a course on phenomenology and so Partly because of the Jordan Peterson stuff and partly because of Dallas Willard whose biography I've been reading it kind of paused his biography because other stuff got more interesting and I'll pick it up and Dallas Willard Taught philosophy at USC in Southern, California and was for those of you are Christians you might recognize name tremendously influential Non-pastor leader at the end of the 20th century big influence on a celebrity pastor like John Ortberg I'm a fan of Dallas Willard But but I never knew what philosophy he was, you know He studied where professionally he was into and actually he was into Husserl and he was into Phenomenology and then when I got into the Jordan Peterson stuff and Jonathan Peugeot, it's like a phenomenology I got to learn more about phenomenology and so I'm learning about phenomenology and here in this section Phenomenology basically Phenomenology is a response to naturalism and so I'm gonna let this guy talk a little while and You can decide if you know what you want to invest your time in but I found this stuff helpful who's rules Specific exposition of that we'll take a look at it now It's considers all and I sort of already mentioned this all forms of reason occurs objects and consciousness and yeah It's a little matter. We're both in the corners But hey, right So when I make an argument that makes sense to you on the video The only reason it does that because you're reasoning and your reasoning means and you'll only reason because you're conscious So so so here again, we started out we talked about I talked about the relationship between reason and community And so he's talking to his listeners and he's saying if I make an argument and you start to understand it The reason it works is because we're reasoning and the hope of reason is that if we all run this long division Problem correctly if we all take these steps correctly we can get beyond all of the corruptions of Naturalism and this is the sense in which CS Lewis talks about reason as being Supernatural in that we are trying to Transcend nature now obviously for a naturalist all of this is within nature. Everything is the whole show But we are trying to transcend nature. We're trying to transcend my hungry stomach. We're trying to transcend my drunken mind we're trying to transcend my sleepy head my natural dullness and and we imagine that reason itself will achieve this monarchical vision and The The the problem that my son was playing a computer game he just yelled the the and so this is the process and and we're hoping by this that we can achieve this monarchical vision and I would also suggest that we're hoping by this that we can achieve control and And this is this is I think something that we've learned in the process of science and technology that once we have science our hearts holistic technology and once we can do something we do try to do something because and this is where my Augustinian background says Our hearts finally govern we we are what we love We are what we want. So let's let this guy continue because I think he's I think he's really helpful So that means that a critique of reason requires an elucidation of consciousness and its correlated structures So in other words as I've been saying so you've got Scott Adams and Sam Harris and they're working the the facts reason thing The phenomenologists come along and say now wait a minute All of this stuff you're doing as human beings You do have motivations and in fact all this seeing is you're seeing through your filter now again Sam Harris and Scott Adams both acknowledge all of that, but the phenomenologists basically say you're not taking that stuff seriously enough because Fundamentally your naturalism is going to devolve into Psychology now when he said that he hasn't said it yet. He will say it in a minute a Light went on for me because right away when I started this thing this whole thing with Peterson I was why is why is this a psychologist? Hmm. Well, let's keep going Phenomenology seeks to provide that grounding by uncovering the correlates with in consciousness Now here's the problem is that sounds a lot like psychology. What exactly is the difference between psychology and Phenomenology the answer is naturalism Naturalism here this coming from the Internet encyclopedia philosophy is the thesis that everything belongs to the world of nature and can be studied By the methods appropriate to studying that world that is the methods of the hard sciences So that so naturalism is the view that ultimately you can understand logic simply by understanding the naturalistic laws Which govern the development of consciousness and all this this is the province of psychology But we'll see that for who's real this is not phenomenology and this is certainly not philosophy. What's the big problem? Well, the big problem is that the naturalist begins by seeing everything as nature, right? Everything is primarily seen as physical nature that's CS Lewis's the whole show And you'll see here is that the philosopher? because my experience the question is the the psychologist brings to the equation a Set of assumptions that the philosopher doesn't I mean this becomes problematic namely that everything is natural Because the philosopher doesn't even yet know what it means for something to be natural Whereas this now now this now now when we talk about Sam Harris Scott Adams and Matt de la Honte They are all embedded in this system And so what happens with Peterson when Peterson gets into a room with these guys He wants to talk about the frame and so the reason their debates seem so unproductive is They just wind up debating the frame Psychologists presumes it as one of their doctrines So and you can see it's not that he's and of course he's against naturalism as a thesis He's not against psychology. It's very important He says even in this essay psychology philosophy from very close together and have a very intimate relationship if you will so the natural scientist the psychologist seeks to naturalize consciousness and The natural scientist and the psychologist seeks to naturalize consciousness as a feature of the natural physical determinants laws and to see consciousness as simply that sort of feature so at the end of the day of the psychologist always begins Whos rule whose rule indicates with a sort of reductionism So how for instance consider how exactly does the natural scientists work? Well one they bring the presupposition that nature is a unity a space you attempt world Again, that's CS Lewis is the whole show being that is the idea that nature is really out here, right? It has space and it's in time, right? And that's also rationality rules You know his objective world so it's real And then what is the natural science do they after making that presupposition about nature? Well, they observe and they collect the data Right from their observations of this nature and then they it's rigorously used this data is to identify distinct laws and regularities and so forth of nature This is all done through inductive procedure and we've had a little bit of discussion about natural laws and what laws are and I continue to say that it's a metaphor and If you if you lose the fact that it's a metaphor you forget the human element of finding these laws and And it's also easy to forget the natural tension in naturalism between these laws and and again if you can What I mean the naturalist has a hard time saying exactly what these laws are Just like you have a hard time if you're naturalist saying what math is is math something we do Do we identify math? Do we discover math or do we create math? Do we create these laws based on observation in other words if human beings go away do these laws go away and then you have the question of are these laws eternal and and so you know, I think Rupert Sheldrake makes a good point that in a sense what we do is we divinize these laws and so when you listen to Matt De La Hunte talk about the laws of physics You know at one point you want to pause them and say well tell me more about these laws Tell me please tell me exactly what these laws are Because are these laws eternal are these laws? necessary because again, De La Hunte wants to frame everything within these laws and then Peterson wants to pull the pull the The frame back and say well actually Peterson doesn't engage with these laws so much here He does a little bit but it would have been interesting for Peterson to say okay Mr. Naturalist tell me exactly what these laws are because are have you discovered these laws? Have you identified these laws and even this word here? Identify distinct laws that implies that the laws are in nature And so again now we've got this question of okay, what's above us? Well the laws of nature are above us Well exactly. What are these laws and again back to one of my other theses I think when it comes to our hearts We have a bias towards We have a bias towards professing that nature is impersonal Because if nature is impersonal we can colonize it and make it our slave which is exactly what we do with technology and and exactly why we Hunger more knowledge so that we can have more power so that we can enslave more now We're into the Lord of the Rings and Sauron Of experience now laws of nature are generalized forms of description That can account for the data. Okay, and so there he's looking much more as at a CS Lewis point of view that laws are ours that That we generalize the data and and create law So what is a natural law or a law? I shouldn't say natural law to not to confuse it with the specific Category of things and floss problems of philosophy But laws of nature essentially where we take these descriptions the natural scientists gets from these empirical data And we generalize them into principles and these principles are so Part and parcel to our observation that they can never in principle be Rejected and certainly not experienced right so the question is well all will this work for consciousness because remember the key for philosophy Is to understand what is the meaning process itself? But you can see since all of this since my experience of nature is an experience Right and my experience comes in the form of consciousness The philosopher can't begin with the assumption that there's anything such as nature the philosopher can only begin with the with by realizing that what they're experiencing is subjectively constituted Right it's within their own head as it were right your experience in the world inside you right never outside and because of that I can never know if my Assumptions about nature right can are verified in nature itself so you can see here that The the natural scientists can't begin to articulate consciousness in this way Unless it begins with an already half-baked claim that consciousness is is Spatio temporal being that is I eat nature and now we're getting into so if you go back and you watch the Debate between Peterson and Matt de la Honte and you listen to that description right there Why can't the naturalist and the phenomenologist? Why do they have trouble talking with each other because in a sense the phenomenologist says I've seen your tricks and You can't see them well This isn't a lot different from the debate between Scott Adams and Sam Harris except. They're both within the same camp Right so what is consciousness well? Here are some things right consciousness is the medium by which the scientist does natural science right? The the natural scientist is actually aware and conscious of what they're doing Right and I should be clear here that under some of whose role in some conceptions of science Science is something that exists socially not necessarily something that exists in consciousness, but we might even say so There's one way of thinking about science as one does science right the consciousness that's present then There's also another thing to think about science as an as a body and collection of work They get to expand it and developed over time But we can say that whether or not science is however science is developed to know any sort of science in a claim is Always to engage in consciousness through this medium of consciousness so and and this again if we live if we go back to all of these conversations that You know think about Brett Weinstein Jonathan Pichot and Jordan Peterson in that conversation in a sense You know Pichot and Peterson are take are taking the phenomenologist twist on this and saying hey You we can't talk about We can't talk about objects in space and time Until we first come to some agreements on consciousness and the others say no, I think we can't and no we can't Here we are Consider what who still calls the exemplary index of Ideality that is formal logic, right? So think here about formal logic now if you haven't taken formal logic check out my lot YouTube videos Or take a logic course and one of the things you'll see is that formal logic essentially assesses the Forms of patterns that we have in our reasoning right and their patterns That seem to be whose logical rigor seems to be independent of the content that they tend to represent Right so when I say all men are mortal Socrates is a man therefore Socrates is mortal right that argument makes sense But it has a distinct form to it right where you be like all M are T all S are M therefore all s are T right as a formal structure and guess what that formal structure maintains its validity under all conditions regardless of what one You know puts under the category of the S of the T, right? So that means that when we're engaged in logical reasoning we're engaging with something That's purely Exist in the ideal right, but I say ideal. I don't mean the way things should be though I kind of do I mean they'd only exist in terms of the essence of ideas That only have existence or being in the mind now Ideal See and now we're getting into some idealism here And I understand what he's saying and I understand what he goes down to the mind because that's the modern thing But if you look at that word throughout all of the history of philosophy obviously It's it's a big deal. I'm not quibbling. I am quibbling with him, but I understand why I took the turn He took right they don't seem to have existence outside of us and yet Everything also around the world seems to be dependent upon these same sorts of laws so the one hand logic is treated as as Like in logic, it's frequent the naturalist on the one hand tends to treat the laws of logic as laws of natural laws laws of nature For thought but the problem is this leads to an absurdity because Natural laws assume something about consciousness that is not directly Inferable from consciousness so in analyzing consciousness what we do is we seek to understand what? Transcendentally comes before any conception of nature whatsoever because our conception of nature is Constituted always as an object right so before we can understand Naturalism as an object as a problem in philosophy we have to first understand what's even possible For consciousness and thereby restrict and organize and schematize our evaluation of these things So in analyzing colleges with two must first begin by understand the ideal laws of thought But since the naturalist presumes from the get-go that all these things are natural then we have what looks like an incoherence at work Where the naturalist sets up an ideal conclusion that will automatically reject all ideal conclusions right? Whos drill writes here, and this is sort of an important passage right quote however an idealist Idealist who sets up and so he thinks justifies theories which deny precisely what he Presupposes in his idealistic war of acting whether it be on constructing theories or of justified and recommending values or practical norms As the most beautiful and best the absurdity is not in his case evident But it remains hidden from him because he naturalizes reason so what whos shows arguing here Is that what the naturalist does is they begin with this pre-subposition about nature they naturalize reason and because of that They net they they are they miss the fact that they're actually setting up ideal conditions right All theories about the mind and logic should look like X. They should look like certain sorts of theses about nature But that's an ideal condition that has a normative aspect to it, but they reject normativity right? So so it doesn't make any sense because ultimately this naturalism at least this sort of physicalism It would reject these ideal conditions, so it's incoherent as it were And this you know this business about naturalizing reason is exactly where CS Lewis comes in because Lewis comes in and says hey wait a minute You you've naturalized reason, but you still act as if Reason is in a sense supernatural as you can transcend Reason you can transcend nature with reason and and Lewis would say you can transcend nature with reason We do it all the time. We do it when we build a dam We do it when we build a dam we do it when we do math We we do it when we actually have a productive argument, and we come to agreement on the basis of reason We can transcend nature with reason so when every time you naturalize reason You're you're you're just lying You're just not telling the truth and and now I'm not going to say that they're being duplicitous Both Husserl and Lewis say you're not seeing What you're doing you're not seeing yourself, and so then we get Peterson and Delahunty talking That's exactly why it's so frustrating. They're not seeing each other, and we'll see when we get into ideas one He's gonna begin to sort of system more systematically develop these though. I think is his really great exegesis This is this logic one book or I'm sorry logical investigations volume one book So what exactly is the difference between philosophy and psychology how can we understand the difference well who's who argues that? Psychology models itself on a form of nationalism So so he's a quote and this from page 86 on the text that I posted even where psychology the empirical science Concerns itself with determination of bare events of consciousness Those events are thought of nevertheless as belonging to nature that is as Belonging to human or brute consciousness that for their part must have an unquestioned and co-apprehended connection with the human brute organism to eliminate the relation to nature would derive the psychic goal of its character as an objectively and temporally determinal determinable fact of nature and Here we are this is this is the project of This is the project of evolutionary psychology now and this is where Peterson gets wonky on the evolutionary psychologist because Yes, we are evolved, but Peterson keeps saying we gotta leave this door open because there's more going on here So his argument here is that the psychologist has good motor has strong motivation to maintain this sort of naturalism Because it maintains a character of objectivity But the problem is it's incoherent because it basically begs the question and begging the question is a is a formal No, I'm sorry. It's an informal fallacy in which your premises Lead to other premises or conclusions that require the premises in a circular sort of fashion Right that is in the case of the naturalist psychologist, right? Their assumptions about nature lead to what looks like inconsistencies in In terms of how they want to also maintain a normative framework for what the cycle what the psychology uncovers now phenomenology by contrast Who's really argues operates really quite differently, right? So number one is in phenomenal as you will analyze the experience in consciousness without pre-supposition whatsoever So we begin from entirely blank slate And he thinks this is going to make this is not this is going to help us uncover Now it's debatable whether they can actually pull this off, but this is this is what the project is like and This goes on I'll put the link to this this video in the in the section so But but but I thought that was helpful and and so finally Husserl will Will say that you know that the the problem with with the problem with naturalism is it finally has all the weaknesses of psychology and it's you've you've snuck it in you've snuck in your you've snuck in your assumptions and Now if you if you understand Husserl's critique of naturalism and you listen to You could say that's the debate they're having except they're not having it directly Why aren't they having it directly? Do neither of them know it? Well, I I doubt that But how long would it take to do this in front of a studio audience? So So so so so then we're we've sort of left down to our teams here where we've got Dilla hunty who I don't know him enough I'll put him in the modernist camp harris another modernist Adams another you know a little bit more postmodern but Kind of defaults to modernism at the end when he thinks he sees because you you need to think you see to act Materialist naturalist reason will yield agreement and cooperation and and this is kind of behind the you know We can get both of us on stage. We'll talk about that later Behind the you know, we can get both of us on stage will reason and then we'll win And so when you look at all the little downstream videos from Peterson Dilla, Honte, you know Peterson destroys Dilla, Honte or Dilla, Honte destroys Peterson or who wins and you know, you always see this at presidential debates do it's like Who wins but it's it's not that you know It's it's really hard to know unless someone really screws up But but notice now with the materialist and the naturalist the emphasis is on seeing and if you this is something i've been noticing if you listen to If you listen to Adams and harris talking, it's all visual and if you listen to Dilla, Honte talking It's all visual and and we see objects and we see nature and we were skeptical about the existence of the god because we can't see him and And and so it's it's a very visual thing and I don't know if Peterson would say well that's because it's the It's the repurposed visual portions of our brain that gave us that gave us the capacity to see so on and so forth But but modernism is all about seeing And and and again this monarchical vision is all about getting to a point and seeing everything Now contrast that with Peterson who's a pragmatist? And now is the phenomenology that he's obviously been studying and that he claims Being is an environment for action that which Peterson repeats again and again and seeing and telling Matter less are actually in the service of doing so in other words we see in order to do We see in order to act And and this I think is why Peterson coming on the stage in a context that assumes this kind of naturalist materialism Peterson starts to talk and and Peterson's points start to sink in with our internal watchers And and we start feeling like Okay, and this this I think in in some ways Helps understand why people are having the experience from Peterson that they have there's like, you know, I think I should go to church I don't know why I don't even believe in god yet, but I think I should go to church I think I should worship. I think I should act I think I should do that Now now I want to get into a meeting meeting someone. I'll hopefully have enough time Peterson time and action. So now what's interesting with with all of this seeing that materialists tend to do It's almost always in this eternalized objectified Frozen state the laws of nature are these things frozen in time? They have no beginning and they have no end after you really press them while they began at the big bang You're begging the question with this. Where do these laws come from? Are they eternal and then you get into the you know, the the The fine-tuning argument about the existence of god that certain variables if they were certain constants if they were if they were a little Bit different. We couldn't have reality the way that we have them So but but also, you know this materialist conception of the word is is very static and it's eternal and it's all about seeing And peterson comes along and says No, and even when he gets into piaget and his equilibrated state, you know actions need to work Actions need to work today and tomorrow and this is where you know homer, you know homer takes the vodka and puts it in the the mayo jar shakes it up and you know, You know too bad for tomorrow homer because you know today homer and piaget says piaget in a sense introduces Subjectivity and time back into the equation and says the equilibrated state has to work has to keep working And it has to work not just for me, but for you and I haven't really thought this through Okay, what's the relationship with reason here? This is this is also getting this is also getting very interesting And then in the question and answer in april video How do we know we're not just projecting and peterson says well because of pain Because of success that kind of sounds like scott adams and also because of other people and and so one of the things that I think that one of the ways peterson subtly Untermines the materialist and why a lot of materialists watching his videos have been moved further and further away from materialism is that he's subtly undermining it by pointing out how time and Subjectivity are once again in play and in fact always in play because Are we sitting in a movie theater looking at objects and fighting over which facts really make sense? or are we living in a world where we have to act and and so I think it's Indicative that even if you have someone who's really trying to be as thorough uh an Epistemological naturalist as scott adams every time he has to has to act he comes back into this common frame where Where where we act where we choose where we say, I don't know what donald trump is Um, but we'll know tomorrow This is why we keep getting pushed here so peterson contra harris adams and delahunty Peterson when it comes to action, which is ethics and morality. How should you act? You're more christian than you admit you sneak the values into a system That says, you know, you must account for everything but you can't account for your values And that's exactly where peterson goes with delahunty in this in this video that peterson says to delahunty That peterson says to delahunty you can't account for your values and that's exactly where they get stuck delahunty says No, my values are self-evident, which is exactly what harris and adams are saying about ethics Well ethics are self-evident. We we always know that no ethics you should read christian smith's work On american youth and their essay ethics. It's very american culturally to say ethics are self-evident And then you might go to the tau and say, you know, do not kill do not steal. These are all self-evident Well, how can we test them? Well, they're built in from below through through Evolution now you might push that back and say as delahunty it is he says no, it's the laws of physics Okay You so you can't yet Tell me where the laws of physics come from and if you're going to rely on those for these these Evolved ethics coming up from below. How are you going to count for them? There are long ways from physics so And and I think again what peterson is doing is subtly undermining this That's that's the effect and again Our brains are far more than conscious and so the watchers behind us are watching these two and and inside You know our little committees are working on and they're thinking. I don't know. I'm kind of in the tribe with delahunty but peterson, I don't know. I kind of like what he's doing and then all the naturalist critiques. Well, he's charismatic he's not being rational because Again in terms of our rationalism we would think peterson should you know what pure rationalism will be a math equation or a syllogism? Um, but then of course they disagree their values are self-evident but trump but harris and Adams cannot get on the same page with about trump. So All right. So there's your system that you keep selling us Oh, it ain't it ain't working for you in what many of you seem to imagine by your actions Is the most important thing you should be doing now? One of the things i've been working on prompted by all of this is to try to Answer the question What is being I mean peterson gosh he he peterson pilled me And and so what is being and well This is a rough diagram and i'm still working on every action decision thought creates the material relational past So every time I think you know, those neural pathways are being connected every time I act I'm creating a new relationship in the world with someone else or i'm building on that relationship every time I either have a fight with my wife or make up from a fight with my wife or Or we have a good evening together or we have a boring evening together, you know, we're we're At every moment we're creating the past And all of those paths are creating the me that acts in the moment. Okay, I think we're trying to Take process a process perspective Let's call it process philosophy Because i'm thinking more in terms of process theology i'm not going to talk a lot about that but that gets in here taking a process perspective That is fundamentally phenomenological phenomenological That says I am a I am all of these series of moments You know, what is a human being a human being is a process now if you listen to enough of peterson stuff You're going to hear he's he's talking more and more about this and this is kind of where the conversation is going and there's reasons For this so so what is paul vanderkley is paul vanderkley this being well paul vanderkley is this being now I have Less hair now than I had 30 years ago Lots of me is different than I was 30 years ago So so it's really different to talk about identity and we're feeling this right now in our social conversations It's really hard to talk about identity outside of time So if I decide that my sexual identity is shirley temple right now I don't know who i'm going to be two hours from now. Maybe my sexual identity will be a 54 year old male when I see my beautiful wife and um, i'm not going to feel sexually like shirley temple i'm going to feel like 54 year old male who loves his wife so so You can't even so so so here's a question for you that just popped into my head So what to what degree are our social justice wars a product of our? materialist assumptions in terms of the secular culture because and to what degree are these things a function of our our social justice wars now a function of moving forward in identity and realizing that I am in the now and If time continues as we all Imagine it does there'll be a future me that will be different from the me That's now and and and now part of the problem with this process perspective is it doesn't fully integrate the other layer which is the um the physical layer But you know, this is a side that the materialist and materialism has developed well to say, you know The materialist perspective has done a good job of focusing on the material causes that are in play But the problem again go back to peterson transliminal 2015 The problem is that in order to see that layer you have to exclude the other layers and so peterson says don't sneak them back in there now When it comes time to integrate what we learn from physical science We have to now figure out how that relates to the other layers and so when it comes to me as a human being I am a process being With a material trail behind me and i've got an image of this in my head that I can't draw And i'm not good with computer animation. Maybe i'll talk to marty leer But but I am moving forward in time one moment after another and all of these layers are happening So every action decision thought is happening The layers are happening so every action decision thought creates the material relational past the past creates the moment But the moment begets the future and the past and so we have this This process which is a bit cyclical that is always going on now It was very interesting because I haven't directly con commented on this video yet A number of you said you've got you comment on this video well, I haven't yet because i've been working this stuff out in my noodle and And when he talks to mcgillcrest they're talking about the hemispheres of the brain But then mcgillcrest gets into what is process theology, which has been around a while and again It's very interesting looking at husserl at the beginning of the 20th century looking at process theology at the middle of the 20th century And looking at we at where we are now at the beginning of the 21st century and saying Holy cow, you know, this is really interesting how this progression is moving in any case What process theology basically says is that god is a process and You know my tradition didn't basically go down that road I think it's probably better to say that we are much more like a process than god is and part of the reason that we want to think of god as a process is Because we are a process and we keep projecting up So let's you know, let's give freud as do we do a lot of projection on god, we return the favor and make god in our image, but Here's this process going and we are this process You know to what degree am I a material being now you talk to the new agers. They say i'm a spiritual being having a material Experience and I would I I don't agree with that I think This is part of what i'm trying to trying to put together with this and so actually I put the layers thing and and so What happens is this has to agree with all of the layers and so it's my relational layer and my physical layer and And my mental layer and all of these layers are at the same time Being created as we go now i'm going to try and talk about this in my sermon sunday boy I don't know if this is going to work, but um, you know, this is what we are and we're always living in this moment We're always living in the now now What's the point of this? now What's interesting is that both harris and adams are seeing two different movies points to adams Both both hope that time will reconcile Their differences. Oh again, we talked about that will it not within their lifetimes? um Because there will not be here's a little prediction for you There will not be consensus about donald trump within any of our lifetimes Why because there are people today who are died in the will trump fans who say he's a great president And there are people today who are died in the will trump skeptics that say he's an idiot So this is not going to be resolved during any of our lifetimes and it probably won't be resolved long after it Uh, maybe maybe not but we won't know it as individual material beings if we establish our identity in that way Right We are material beings in process in moment x We see and judge our brain pathways and act changing the world relationships environments And set up and we come being b. This is us in the moment in moment x plus one being b plus one repeats the cycle all of this is happening at once in the world with all of us and we're all deeply connected and Wow It's a big deal and and I think this is a pretty good way of of seeing what's going on now Okay, peterson dilhante wanted is there a god? Well, peterson always says it depends on what you mean by god, which again people knock him for that Be but peterson I think rightly says that's a really hard question And now i'm a christian minister. Do I believe in god? Yes Um I can't go into that because i've got to meet somebody at three o'clock and that's seven minutes from now So I want to finish this. I don't want to do two takes so A better question is Is this being processed system open or closed? And you might read charles taylor or alvin plantiga on this question because basically secularity or in c.s. Lewis's the whole show Says it's a closed system Planting a taylor c.s. Lewis would say you don't know that it's exactly what peterson says you don't know that Is there a supernatural Well, could a materialist see it and dilahunty I think rightly says well i'm agnostic I can't know that there's a god and this is exactly where peterson pounces and says Okay, i'll agree with you there, but you sure act like there is and dilahunty then is No, I don't and I Let's let's all assume we don't really know why we do what we do to a great degree. Let's let's give scott adams his due But you act as if there's a future and again this is where I think this is why peterson is changing hearts and minds because Underneath this I think our watchers are saying there's something to this guy There's something to that even if everyone's getting ticked at him see time begets eschatology Harrison adams wait for the truth about donald trump to be revealed Dilahunty waits for death or the second coming for the truth about a good many things to be revealed Jordan peterson then i'm not gonna have a chance to play this too bad. It's in the it's in the april question and answer Jordan peterson is this really interesting? question about egoism and And it begs for an a realized idealism of love and I I would play it but I don't have time But go ahead and watch it. It doesn't begin at 35 someone did a rundown, but it's in it's in peterson's 2018 but but his egoism what's really interesting about that is Peterson basically says via piaget egoism doesn't finally work. He and page a give us a vision now note again. This is a vision Of loving our enemy and this is a power effort powerful affirmation of a very difficult christian teaching And and again, this is another reason why I think Peterson is You know someone said breadpilling in terms of making peterson is breadpilling people. He's getting people want to take the eucharist um peters peterson is getting people to want to act as if they are a christian because And you look at peterson talking about egoism and in a sense egoism isn't real. Well, what do you mean egoism isn't real? Well harris and adams are debating if if um donald trump is an egoist uh, well Peterson basically says it isn't real ideally Where is this idealism? Where is this this realm where thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven We live in the now loving enemies is hard painful and sometimes leads to death and this is where peterson's pragmatism and his idealism start to conflict because He can see again see that Egoism ideally evaporates and and it finally cannot win Love wins. I'm not endorsing rob bell's book um Love wins, okay And love wins gets acted out how by jesus sacrifice on the cross leading to Correction and peterson's would could say that's an archetypal story Illustrating piaget and he's observation about egoism finally being self-defeating in other words The god of the universe finally wins Does sam harris Or scott adams win their debate about donald trump not in their lifetimes Maybe one will cave but there'll be another camp that won't Do jordan peterson and dilla honte win? Well, whose eye is beholding it? What game are we playing? What actions did watching result in? What tribe switching did the watching result in? We're nested in a divinized political process where changing hearts and minds is the key No one seems ready to give up on reason though. Notice that through this whole thing No one is ready to give up on reason c.s. Lewis's critique continues to hold We still play the game of asserting that naturalists corrupt Naturalist corruptions disqualify even adams who tries to take them into account more than the other materialist In the end becomes a modernist and has to act And again points to jordan peterson on there Every system is eschatological Is eschatology reasonable in a materialist system? well adams and adams and harris are Are eschatological with their ideas about trump will will the truth of donald trump finally be known be home by be known by whom? If you ask a christian, what would a christian say? Dear old saint in my sunday school class whose saintly mother was you know married to a sharecropper lived in jim crow south She had one word for everything. It was god knows it's jordan peterson god only knows Um, you know, it's eschatological And this is the point that you know Oh, we're gonna run around and we're not gonna believe in god and we're gonna think our own selves and we're gonna try and do this But in a sense what peterson is saying is now we're not escaping We're not escaping it Um, if you think this thing through this is where it goes Every system is eschatological if they have values and these values lead to ends um And and but the embrace of every ask s eschatology is that of faith materialists say well at some point We'll have enough science science. Well, but the problem with science is It's not the human heart. So then they say well at some point we will have Deconstructed a human being sufficient Sufficient to what end? That's the question So we're not escaping it Okay So, how should you live we're back to peterson's question, what are your values how will you know those values Someone you know was talking to me about james k smith who's a popular professor at at calvin college teaches philosophy And and I was telling them I think the jordan peterson community listening to james k smith would yawn Because oh, yeah, we're constructed all the materialists know that The question is what is the good? And in a sense christians over here talking about we're constructed and we're formed and we have these liturgies Everyone else would say yeah, we figured this out a while ago What we want to know is well, you know, we're we're on to phenomenology And and we're trying to figure out what is the good can we know the good? And and that's why folks are are coming into church the christians already say yeah, we already know the good Um, it's these other folks out here that are saying can we know it? What are the values where do they come from? How does time fit in with your moment and process? Back to adam's two filters Does it make you happy? Well now? Well, what about what about homer simpson drinking alcohol and mayonnaise? Jordan peterson and psj saying okay. Does it make you happy now? Will it make you happy tomorrow? Will it make you happy forever? Will it make everyone happy forever? It's a very idealized vision Did it predict adam's second filter? I think our post-hoc rationalizations in time and process continue to undermine freedom Art not freedom, but reason That's kind of the point. We're doing post-hoc stuff not only in terms of our evaluating trump right now We will keep doing that that's not going to stop until something else changes And again, we're not giving up on reason because we hope that maybe somehow reason can allow us to transcend this Is the jordan peterson egoism idealism, right? And what does the curve of history really look like? And I think it comes down to the eschatology of the man on the cross So I have to wrap this up now. I'm a minute late Hope my friend And you're out there and you'll probably watch this because i'm meeting with someone I met through my videos but There it is and i'll let it render while i'm gone and i'll post it later this afternoon This was this was very ramble-ish And you know, you're getting real rough drafts. I'm thinking this stuff through and this is my third attempt at this video And I don't know if it's going to be any good or not We'll see, you know, maybe your conscious minds will say banderclay makes no sense But maybe some of your watchers will pick up stuff and um, yeah, i'm eschatological One love
