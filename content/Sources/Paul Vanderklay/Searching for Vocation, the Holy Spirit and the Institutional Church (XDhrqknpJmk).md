 How are you Andrew? I'm good, I'm good. How are you? I'm doing fine. Congratulations on getting a slot. Yeah so, interesting story there. Don't tell it. Well tell me a little bit about yourself. So I'm going to be 25 next week. Okay, congratulations. Thank you. A quarter century. Yeah. Lord willing. So I grew up going to a church that said first Baptist on the outside. Wow, old enough not to duck the moniker, huh? Well I say it that way for a reason. Okay. Because I remember one of the two or three pastors that went through when I was going there growing up was being very adamant in saying that we were evangelical Christians or that we needed to be evangelical Christians and I've grown up in a town called Westbrook, Maine and I went to First Baptist Church in Portland, Maine. The original Portland. Shots fired. Yeah. And I went to everything. I went to Sunday school, I did you know children's ministry, youth group, you know high school small group, we called it powerhouse and I grew up in that church and even though it said first Baptist on the door, I never really got like a strong denominational pull or you know my dad would always make you know some comments about the Catholics you know half in jest but that was as deep as it went. And then so I did all the things right and I sang all the songs and this story will not be a surprise to you or anybody that has talked with a young adult about their faith journey that especially ones that grew up in the church where you do all the things and you go through the motions and you believe it to some degree and when you're four years old you know at you know some Bible camp you you ask Jesus into your heart and everybody's happy if you're and you're like why are you happy for me I don't get it and you know you just have this later right later in life for me I was I was 17 and I can point to a moment where everything changed and you know I would use the language I received the Holy Spirit that that's how I would explain it because I've never been able to look at the world the same way and so there was like a very sort of visceral embodied change for me and so what happened 17 was this happened the summer right before my senior year and so that first you know half of senior year is applying to colleges and basically deciding what you're going to do for the rest of your life. Yeah or they say that. I think that's that's kind of if that's not exactly how society has like pressured you know young people it's how young people feel yeah and I was definitely in that boat where it was like this is going to dictate my life this decision. No pressure. And I'm 17 I don't know anything and on top of that I just had this life-changing spiritual experience that very few people if any could understand and you know I love my parents but they they couldn't really handle it and they were they were really taken aback because I was talking to like people in the church and during small groups and things like oh I'm thinking about going to seminary or I'm thinking about just like I want to go all in on this like this is so real to me right now I need to I need to go all in like that's isn't that you know. Yeah supposed to do and so and I didn't know anything right and so that was like the natural thing and of course I was thinking institutionally I was thinking I'll become like a professional worship leader because I had my passion for music at the same time was really growing and it was actually at soul fest which is a Christian concert festival in New Hampshire. It's been in different places in New England over the years but that's like in that I was it was like in a time of worship that I believe that I you know professed with my mouth that Jesus is Lord and believed in my heart that God raised him from the day the way that I think it's Paul describes it. And so I go and I tell this to my parents like no actually this is the funny part they cornered me and they're like hey man you've been saying for five years that you want to be a mechanical engineer and go to the University of Maine and all this stuff and I was like they cornered me because they were hearing it they're like oh like we're so proud of Andrew that he's thinking about these things and they're like they're like what is this you know yeah and I like I bore my soul to them and we were all in tears and they weren't they were not you know exactly joyful tears because I feel like a part of a part of their world was kind of being shaken and they weren't ready for it and yeah you know the more I'm not sure that I've fully reconciled that. It's not that long ago. It was a long time to you but it was a long time to you but in terms of your parents years it's not that long ago. Yeah it was almost it was almost eight years ago so that to me that's a long time that's almost half my life so but if you're in your 50s your parents are probably in their 50s or early 60s and so yeah 50 less long for them. Yeah so I had this so this seminal moment happens in my life and there weren't people in my life that were sort of like feeding the spirit in a way and so I did end up going to the University of Maine for a degree in mechanical engineering and I fought it the whole way. Interesting. And people I had this love-hate relationship and after my sophomore year I was like I don't care about this like like I was at the university and I was like I was at the top of my class in high school and my parents are always like you could get straight A's if you wanted to I just hated doing homework you know and I would have like a pretty pretty bad homework grade and still get an A or a B in the class and so like capability was never my issue with engineering or anything that I wanted to do so I was like why can't I do the thing that I want and it was like it was a really it was a roller coaster for sure and I was I was seeking outlets and I even kind of started a church a little bit. We started like a gathering and we called it college church because I wasn't I didn't actually find a church at school yeah and I don't know why like because I struggled to find that community I haven't I've often struggled to to make like really solid friendships and I've always felt like I was in between you know to you have like the you know the normal kids and like I there was a there was a period in my life where I was friends with like the nerds that would you know have deep philosophical conversations or you know talk about math or you know sci-fi or I actually it's funny that you mentioned that you play civilization because those guys really loved it and I'm terrible at management games just it was a miserable experience for me but you know they were my best friends and you know they accepted me for who I was and so I played civiliz- you know sim five with them for a little bit and um yeah so I didn't really have that connection and so I kind of made it you know I was like hey I found like a little bible study it was only like six people and I knew I knew most of them and I was like why don't we why are there all these different ministry groups why don't we why don't we bring them together you know I don't I don't like this let's you know everybody's got their own culture and their own you know creeds and their own things like what if we had like a worship night because I you know I play guitar and I sing and I've been leading worship since I was 15 and um like why don't why don't we do that kind of thing and it actually it just turned into like a church service and you know I got up and led and the guy that was leading our you know bible study small group said a few words and but like most of the fruit was born in all these disparate people um just like meeting each other and having fellowship like I was like oh my gosh this like star tight end you know on the football team is talking with and he's like six four 250 pounds is talking to this little you know the little people or whatever and yeah you know really connecting and yeah um so like there was there there's been fruit that's been born in this time but these past couple of years I finally well hang on hang on you left me in the middle of you're in college you're getting your mechanical engineering degree yeah um you're kind of starting a church and you want to bring people together you clearly have some some leadership qualities and instincts and gifts if that's happening around you do you get your engineering degree or not so sophomore year I was like I'm done and I was talking with a friend of mine from high school that was also um going to the same school and he was like dude like why don't you just go do it why don't you go do like audio production like you want because I was I was recording and producing my own music that's where this this lovely mic comes from okay um and you know a few a couple of listens on soundcloud you know nothing nothing major really early kind of embarrassing stuff and he's like why don't you just like go do it and so I did I was like okay I'm gonna do this and so there's a school like right down the road in Bangor um called the New England School of Communication and I was and they've they have alumni that have gone on to do like work with fans like Aerosmith and you know every school has at least one guy that's done something you know yeah um my high school used to brag that somebody ended up was like an executive with Apple or something like that so everybody's got usually has like one person and so I was like okay it's right down the road I can still have this community I can still do college church and you know Bible study and these things and I prayed I really prayed I told my parents and my mom she's an accountant so she sent me a spreadsheet and she's like this is how much you're gonna have to pay and you're gonna have and this is how and I was like and my dad was like oh they have a quota over there so they're gonna they're gonna sell it to you you know you're gonna get like a used carsman you know sales pitch I got the exact opposite I got a down-to-earth guy I told him my story he's like I can't tell you to come here yeah it's like you're gonna graduate debt-free because I had you know a really good merit-based scholarship yeah um and he's like you're gonna graduate debt-free and you know the music industry needs mechanical engineers so why don't you try it and do something like that and I was praying for like like God tell me tell me if this is where I need to be and I got this feeling that I did not belong there and it was like it was real like it was real enough that I couldn't ignore it you know yeah um so that was sophomore year so I decide you know by by the end of junior year it's like I have to graduate at this point and I also started a 3d printing club uh towards the end of junior year and that was well this is the funny thing right because that same friend that encouraged me to go into audio engineering the next year he's like dude I've been looking I've been looking at 3d printers and I'm a student council we got all this money that we need to use um let's start a 3d printing club and so he's the type of guy that does everything because if he ever didn't do something he'd have to think you know he'd have to think about his life for a little bit and that might you know not be the most positive experience for him and so he was just like okay dude I can't run this club so here you go here's the paperwork I just made you president and you know I've been out of I've been graduated for three years now and it's still going and it keeps growing so um and I learned a lot there because I learned the the power of diversity of perspective and thought because when I was the one that was the leader and making the decisions and the only one having the ideas it was kind of a miserable experience and then when we had like a core of like six people out of the 10 or 20 uh total I was like I'm getting chills right now because like when you get people with different talents and perspectives and you're just like why didn't I think of that like I couldn't have thought of that and that's so good why don't we do that but leadership is the ability to be in there and help that group find you know find union and find a path forward so yeah keep going I'm loving the story um so where are we so yeah that was all happening senior year was like basically capstone so we we do uh you do a big project instead of like a thesis like other uh disciplines engineering you make something um which is like the first time in the whole yeah yeah the whole educational you know experience that we actually made something which kind of bothered it really bothered me yeah um but they would tell you that if you want to like make something that you go into engineering technology which is more of the the hands-on engineering whereas mechanical is more like design like how is this beam going to handle this load that's that's what I learned I went into so the reason in the first place that I wanted to do mechanical engineering was um I wanted to like invent things yeah and yeah um so actually I have behind me I don't know if you notice I just stacked some books because my bookshelf was over there and there actually aren't that many books on it so I've got my css collection but behind that's a 3d printer yeah I know and here's one of my projects that I've done oh okay I could recognize the 3d printer but I didn't know what the yeah the thing next to it was we're not there yet okay good good keep going um so it's senior year we're working on capstone and we're making um we're making what they call the land drone so you know about quadcopters right yeah yeah so imagine so imagine a an autonomous vehicle on the ground and so this would be like if you needed to go into like a dangerous wooded area and do some reconnaissance or like patrol I was watching lost gold of world war two last night they sent a little land drone into a little tunnel to scope it out so I'm following yeah so we had to like do programming with gps and um I was like one of the first people that made uh their own obstacle avoidance system on like a little mini you know rc car thing yeah and um I like I'm I can do it like I can be an engineer but I just don't uh we'll get to later why I just don't I can't do it keep going yeah yeah yeah yeah so what happens it's good to have those gifts and skills oh yeah no I it's all part of my story they'll get used they'll get used keep going yeah they end the story that you haven't heard yet they will so senior year we we work in this capstone and something happened and I kind of made this decision and I feel like I've been very recently I've been sort of suffering the consequences of this decision where I basically said I can't do anything else but school this is so like miserable and like tough and so like tedious work and drudgery that this is all I can do because I'm a huge procrastinator like tedious work and drudgery that this is all I can do because I'm a huge procrastinator I distract myself you know I'm I'm just you know a professional distractionist like yeah yeah that's what I do and so I think without whether consciously or not I basically decided to cut off my connection with the Holy Spirit I think that's I think that's what happened and excuse me on some level not to say that he wasn't still with me or even working in me because I think a lot of times God works in spite of us probably most of the time and he definitely was because I've toyed with the idea of kind of throwing a lot of this away and I can't I've you know I've come to the conclusion that I can't and it would I'd be losing a lot if I did but that that was really what happened senior year and the college church wasn't happening anymore the small everybody was swamped senior year so even our little small group nobody was willing to make the time because we were all seen most we were pretty much all seniors and just felt like we couldn't give that time which is like the exact opposite of the truth so that was senior year and I was at like a real low only like I basically entered like the the second depressive episode in my life and I skipped the first and I'm not sure why but that was in high school and the problem was I was looking for jobs but I didn't have the training that I wanted to sort of make that compromise right I liked sort of the programming and the inventing side of things and so I had two pretty terrible interviews with different you know a couple I only got like two interviews because I didn't feel like all through college I was like I need an internship if I'm going to get a job I need an internship but I can't look somebody in the eye and say I want to do this job and you should hire me like I felt this real whether it was like a moral you know tension or just like something where I cannot honestly look somebody in the eye and say that you you should hire me because I know what they're getting honest it's too honest yeah I think I've definitely learned that I think this may be aspirational but like openness and honesty is my ethic you know is my there might be a better word for it but that's I've really learned that and I think it's I think it's a gift I think it's part of my spiritual gifting we'll get to that but yeah so I couldn't so I tried but the only thing that would afford me financial independence which is like that's what you do you graduate college and you get a job so you can gain financial independence and move out of your parents' house that's what that's what it's for the problem with me was my goal wasn't to get the career and to get the financial independence it was just I need to suffer through this degree so it'll be over like and if that's your goal what happens when the degree is over yeah yeah yeah and so I I only know this in hindsight right um and so what happened was the only people offering me financial independence was the institution that I had the love-hate relationship with and so history repeated itself where I basically accepted this thing that I didn't want because of some obligation to the norm or to the you know some this is what you know people do and I've always I've always had this tension with the nine to five and the the American you know corporate culture and I've always kind of been hopefully we can get to the institutional you know tension in this conversation because I think it's it's really deep deeply rooted in me and so I spent the summer as a graduate research assistant under an advisor and it was it was like the worst because in that moment if I had like in that moment if I had tasks if you had given me a list of things to do I would have done them and I would have been at least stable or a form of you know stability yeah but it was it was utter ambiguity and they didn't have really have a place for me because it was a last-minute decision because I didn't you know all the everything else fell through and um I started the process really late and one of the projects that they wanted me on just lost funding you know within the first month and and I even went to Michigan and did training for this and then finally at the end of the summer they had a meeting and they're like okay Andrew you're finally going to do something and I had the first panic attack of my life and I wanted to run out of the building like I was sitting there and my heart was beating you know I was I was having a real anxiety attack panic attack whatever you want to call it I'd never experienced that in my life even though I had you know gone through depressive episodes it was never an anxiety thing I was like what is anxiety why do people talk about this and then it was right there and I was I wanted to run out of the building but my advisor caught me in the hallway he's like I need to talk to you so I was sitting there like you know heart racing like I need to run like you just get this like it was the fighter flight and I was like I was ready to fly man yeah and I was like this is yeah this is heavy and luckily luckily I had a friend and he's like you know there's this guy Tim Ferriss who talks about this kind of thing and he has this video called fear setting it's like what are you afraid of and it's like I was afraid of breaking the cycle right this cycle of sort of following this you know charted out course that you know the nine to five the kind of my parents vision in a lot of ways and he says and this this really helped me because this is what allowed me to break the cycle was this video and so I wrote out like my what if I drop out of grad school and you know start a YouTube channel or you know do 3D printing on like it was mostly 3D printing YouTube and so that's that's why that's back there and so I did and I had to talk to my advisor and say you spent you know thousands of dollars to send me to Michigan for two weeks and I'm gonna throw that away I didn't I didn't I avoided that but that's basically what I was telling him was like you've made an investment and it was a waste and yeah to his credit he was very gracious and I don't know he's it just worked out and I had the weirdest feeling leaving you'd think it would be this liberating you know singing in the rain moment but it was more I couldn't decide which you know if I had done the right thing the wrong it was just this weird I mean it was probably like the unknown you know it's like I'm moving home I had to eat the security deposit from my apartment and I hope she found somebody my landlord because she was great and I couldn't find anyone in time and it was just all these like but I did it and I came home and I was like I'm gonna start a 3D printing YouTube channel what's your what's your parents have to say about that well I sent them a letter um in sort of the last month of summer um and it was funny because I knew I needed to leave on the very first day that classes started it was so weird I felt so outside from everybody else I looked around and I was like these people want to be here I am not like I don't belong here yeah yeah you know it's like it's not fair to anyone for me to be here yeah um and so I sent I sent them a letter and they immediately like they immediately wanted to do a Skype conversation because I had been putting on a face so I wouldn't you know break their hearts and they were like we we didn't know you know it was like and I told them I was miserable I was depressed I was yeah like I can't do this anymore I need to come home yeah and so I they were like yeah come home man and my dad came came up that weekend and we tried to do some fishing just to you know do something and yeah um yeah so I started a 3D printing YouTube channel and and I laugh every time you say that you ride the coattails of Jordan Peterson because I rode the coattails of Fortnite and one of my videos might like my second my first video got 60,000 views and like my second video got like 400,000 views wow and good for you yeah um I couldn't make it into anything more than that oh wow hey but yeah it was cool it was fun like they actually Epic Games like hired me to make some props for them really and they yeah they made them um prizes in a social media contest cool I'm pretty sure all of them broke but hey I got paid like I mean the money's gone now but so really since um I eventually kind of lost you know I really felt like God was with me in that and it was weird because I would like I would pray I'd be like my dad made some offhand comedy he's like I don't know how you make money doing this and I was like you know what I can scoff at that but he's right because I was releasing you know the files for free because that's the culture that's the 3D printing culture like make it available make you know and I'm very much for that and all my files are free yeah um and he's like how do you make money and I was like I prayed that night I was like you know God can can you like lead somebody to to see what I'm doing and to value my talent and want to hire me yeah and the next day is when Epic Games contacted me and so there were like these moments where I can look back and be like coincidence you know was I just doing the right thing and it just happened like you know I don't believe it was you know because even coincidence is God right even if it is God number one you know um so yeah I eventually so once I had I think success led to decadence I think now this just popped in my head and maybe it's true because I was like oh now I need to go and I need to target Ninja who is like the top Fortnite streamer he probably like he's been on Forbes and like has become this mainstream gamer now like he's like the face of gaming um and I was like okay I'm gonna make something for him and he'll see it and I'll blow up and yeah I think that was like my first I think that's where I kind of was like okay I'm successful now it's you know it's up to me yeah and this is gonna work yeah and I just make it happen again yeah yeah I listened to your conversation with uh with Julian this morning and you said something like that you know we're gonna do it right this time yeah um and so I think that led to decadence and I really lost passion for it and I haven't I haven't done it in in a while and I haven't had nearly the success I did you know when Fortnite was was at its peak and so I think we're caught up to the last couple of years which I just wanted to skip to earlier um because I when I came back from college I started going to um a local church that had just rapidly expanded into an old uh discount furniture building okay so and they they went with the excuse me the community center model where they have like they actually have like a half-size soccer field you know turf in there and they've got a playscape and they've got a cafe kind of like urban abbey I'm not familiar with that they're in they're in Thunder Bay Ontario and they're the ones that um putting on a conference if it comes up in September where I'll be talking with John Verveke and Jonathan Peugeot um there's a there's a video on my channel with um uh Scotland Morrison who founded Urban Abbey you might really you might really like that conversation because he most of the video is him going through his story and then you might really connect with it so you might okay you might look it up okay when I go back and watch this video I'll try to take that note down or maybe you can include it for me yeah um so but anyway I had actually seen this this model when I visited my friend who was actually part of the small group in college in Pennsylvania me and a mutual friend of ours we drove down to Pennsylvania to visit him for a weekend just just for fun and went to his church um and it was this huge you know facility with I think they had a McDonald's in there I think it even like it even it had some McDonald's like rest you know some restaurant in there with a playscape where they hosted you know birthday parties and things and so this is pretty much like Maine's version like they didn't have 10,000 people going there but um this church I think they say they have 20 2,500 members so it's it's a mega church by Maine standards because you know I don't know if you've heard the classic line that you know New England and especially Maine is a is like a dark you know corner you know spiritually dark corner of the US um so like well part of my family's from from New England so and my family now lives in New England except for me out here in California so I'm pretty familiar with New England okay yeah so gathering 2,500 people it's a big deal in New England it really is and um so yeah they just they did this huge multi-million dollar expansion into this building and part of that was because they had to practically rebuild the building to make it you know secure enough and so it's it's got a warehouse vibe right it's not you know it's the modern sort of clean lines and wood against steel and you know gray walls and um you know the auditorium is like stadium seating and you know there's floor seating stadium seating all that um and I started going to this church and I was like I need to get plugged in I know that they have life groups and that's I really I'm more focused on the life group because again I have this institutional tension and um so I started getting plugged in and I eventually um so I did I did all those things I still like I'm still going to go to church you know I have this this tension with the institutional structure of it but I'm still going to go to church well talk yeah I mean that's what you wanted to talk about and I'm afraid I don't want to run out of time to not talk about that so why don't you you know veer towards that tell me more about that yeah well we are because I you know I've been having this I've since I was like 15 I've been on and off having this inner dialogue about the church and um and my problems with it um I don't like the way we talk in denomination I don't I don't like how we how we use that language um because I don't see that in scripture um at least you can see a little bit of denominational tension with like the circumcision non-circumcision like what you know different there are different opinions from different groups of people because of their you know you got the Greeks and you got the Jews and the other you know these things going on I'm reading Acts right now so you can you start to see a little bit like they write a letter saying that you know because the circumcision folks want them to follow all the laws of Moses and they're like no we're just going to come up with these principles and we're going to send out the apostles with this letter just saying hey this is what we expect of you guys this is what we think is good for the Holy Spirit um you know and I I met my best friend at this church and what's funny is he's a part of my earlier story because he went to the same church that I grew up in and we never connected and so our stories like were next to each other and it was only until we met at this church that we were both you know criticizing under our breath that um we bonded over Jordan Peterson um and so we started with Jordan Peterson and we're like we both kind of understand his shtick and you know not to be drogatory but like we once you watch enough videos you know what he's saying and you know what you agree with and what you nuance and and what you disagree with um and so we evolved from Jordan Peterson to then he was like man I wanted you know I wish the church was this way and I was like okay it's Marty Pants why don't you tell me what your church would look like because I was I also I kind of like had this paradoxical thing um in my own heart because a lot of people in my life were if they weren't becoming nuns they weren't going to church and I was like that's wrong I'm going to defend the church you know in the face of those people because we're all doing it wrong um that was always my that was my mantra it was like okay yes but we're all doing it wrong so go to church that was my thing and so now here's somebody saying wait a second you know I think this is how the church should be and so we evolved and we we we couldn't help but use um you know our new church as like a punching bag and we try it we're like oh let's do a podcast because we admire so much you know the intellectual podcast and Jordan Peterson and Joe Rogan and all these other thinkers and um and we're like and we listen back to it and we're like I I don't like this because we were like we were talking about the church that one you know church that we went to specifically while trying not to talk about it and it wasn't very fruitful and now our conversation has transformed into this into a broader sense of like wait a second it seems that the church the body right we made this distinction where if I asked you which is more the church the people or the institution what would you say yeah yeah um I think a lot of people be like oh it's the people obviously it's the people yeah yeah but what they say is like what people say now is like the church is not a building it's the people and I'm like you're missing it you're missing it because it's the institution you're missing it because it's the institution you're missing you know you know you can you can still be the body of Christ and meet in a building but um and you can still and you can still be the body of Christ and have an institution but when the body is is structured around the institution rather than the person of Jesus you get into a lot of trouble because you get because especially when that institution is also embedded in the American institution and this is the thing that I've been like this is why I was so eager to talk to you because I was like I was like strangling my monitor because it's not its fault it was all I had Paul Vanderklae wasn't here to strangle in the flesh so the monitor took it the sacrificial monitor yeah and so like so me and my friend Miles you know I'll give a shout out to him because we've been evolving which is like really cool like it's it's transformed from us like complaining about something to us like really growing spiritually and um so this past weekend really this this thing about the person of Jesus is what really came up because um we were I felt really bogged down on what I should do right because I'm I don't have a job I know I didn't say that but I I have this institutional tension it makes it really hard for me to look somebody in the eye and like you want me for this job yeah and jobs and institutions kind of go together right and you know you you immediately like you know saw some sort of like leadership and you know church building things in me and I've been like I've been blind to that for for a lot of the like for years now and this past weekend so over the past few months Miles and I have been trying to start a little gathering with our friends and I think at first we were trying to like start a home church movement but I think now it has become more of a more of just like a dedication of time to help encourage people spiritually for a guy who's a little allergic to institutions why why think about them so much why not just you know I I work with church planters all the time and why not just do instead of I mean the institution stuff if if anything gets going at some point you have to deal with the institution stuff but that's as you I think are pointing to that's not the life of it right when when the institution becomes the life of it something has died and that's when often institutions become problematic but if the organ and the institution are actually working together in the right way that's a you know that's a beautiful thing yeah I just struggle to see that happening well I mean and that's why it's important to do so you make the wine and worry about the wine skin as it grows around so I think the reason why this has become such an issue is because Miles and I were just both kind of individually miserable and we were looking for edification and so we go to the institutionally sanctioned times for edification yeah and do do we achieve it do we is it there to be had yes I believe it is but I think there's a I think there's a problem when you try to um so there's a um there's a sermon by Judah Smith I don't know if you're familiar there's a sermon by Judah Smith I don't know if you're familiar that really so let's we can bring this back um recently it's called what happened to my passion and that's not really what we held on to what we held on to is this idea that he brings up that the church it's very easy within the institution especially to get bogged down on what are the list of things that I should do for a successful life what are the list of things that I should do for a success even a successful spiritual life it becomes it every sermon is three points or you know the seven steps to success like it's it's that's a really that's a really evangelical thing okay that grew up in the 80s and 90s in the seeker movement I mean what happened see I'm old enough to remember before the seeker movement and you're not and yeah what happened was that Bill Hybels and Rick Warren said you know boy we've got to recapture the boomers because they're becoming nuns and the way to do that is to impress them with wisdom and so all over all over America sermons started becoming like that and everything was programized and right so you have in Bill Hybels you had um you basically have had seven steps to make a prevailing church and Rick Warren had his baseball diamond and it just it just went on and on and on like that which is then what birthed the emergent movement that said whoa and the emergent emergent movement split into two parts you know one side which was sort of the the right which was the young restless and reformed and then the other side which sort of was the left which has also splintered because that's the protestant way into you know the the urban abbey movements are in some ways a reflection of that and another way um so a guy in uh you know the grand village mall in Grand Rapids Michigan Rob Bell um you know turns a shopping mall into a mega church and then leaves it to to go the Rob well the Rob Bell way making videos and talking to Oprah so you know you're you're in that in that sense you're following you know sort of along the lines of the post seeker the post seeker wandering away you've had so much institution that it's like these these I can't be programatized because I'm far too complex as an individual as a human being so you're looking to make your own path well that's hard that's you know it is oh my gosh if you've ever and you live in Maine you got plenty of woods um you know walking a path through the woods is one thing walking through the woods without a path is a whole other thing you know the reason they call it bushwhacking because you're all you're doing is whacking bushes and it's hard work so yeah I um institutions so let's just go keep going well I was gonna say that it's it's just interesting where I'm so I think um I think we're starting to evolve beyond that I think I'm I think we're starting because something happened this past weekend when after we we we had one of our meetings right and I was like you know I've been saying for a while that I don't think that anything Miles and I do is going to go anywhere because we're like we're bankrupt of the Holy Spirit and we're reading acts and why do you say you're bankrupt of the Holy Spirit um because the fruit of the Spirit is love and joy and peace and kindness and goodness and faithfulness and self-control I probably missed one um and I think I missed gentleness yeah yeah I always do um well why do you say that it felt that way I'm not saying that's that's what it was but just part of the difficulty about having a kind of conversion experience that you had is sort of the same problem that the coke or the um the crack attic has is that you can't you're always looking to relive that original high and that um I mean those highs are gifts and a story for you and I've sort of had a revelation this past weekend so all of this was going through my mind and I was I was feeling discouraged because um and people have been telling me like oh you can't you know count on you know feelings and things like and I I know that they're right but the way they say it or like there's something about it that just wasn't the right things hadn't happened or you know I wasn't receptive or um because I actually baptized Miles on Sunday oh boy I'm sorry I feel I must look like some like really like spacey like out there I don't you know that's if I with oh you Baptists if once is good again is better well that's the thing I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry it was the second of course it was I've only been baptized once it was in direct response to the Holy Spirit and I'm good I'm good okay we didn't well I didn't grow up with a Baptist culture it said we said Baptists on the outside of the building but I remember like three Baptisms it's like it's not like there was a Baptism every week and that was the whole point of the thing they had all been done before um we we had an encounter with the Holy Spirit because and we were feeling miserable and like totally right not bearing the fruit of the Spirit at least not intention like not it didn't feel that way and not not not one of those frou-fou feelings like being high on the Spirit I I know what that feels like and I'm not I wasn't looking for it I wasn't looking for it and I was just like complaining to Miles and then he was like Andrew and he just started like saying things that he's been holding back for so long and telling me that I have I have spiritual gifts and that I can see the truth in things and that whenever I talk to people they get pissed off because I say the truth and and it's often something that they need to hear they just don't want to hear it and so they go to Miles and complain about me to him and you know I was like it was like revelation and we had this experience with the Holy Spirit and I was and he was like Andrew I've been thinking of this for a long time like to like I want to ask you to baptize me and I was like yes like what you know kind of like you know Philip and the Ethiopian unit like what is to keep you from being baptized right now and it was 2 a.m and it's only like it's still 20 degrees at night in Maine so I was ready to go out to the river the next day yeah if we had this conversation last week I would be a different person it's weird and but my perspective is this I was so concerned on what I needed to do what is the list of things that I should be doing and how am I falling short of this list of things to do and I think what happened was Miles was telling me who God made me to be not what God made me to do but like who I am in a sense and I know that's that's a huge dog whistle for modern culture like it's who I am like it's you know yeah yeah but I think I think there's I think where the institution goes wrong is it's so easy in that structure to think think of it as principles and and programs and pamphlets and this is how I bolster my faith whereas I think the truth is closer to something you need to be approaching and seeking the kingdom of God in your life and what that looks like is who God made you to be because when you think about Jesus he was exactly who God made him to be yeah and we will never attain that standard but if we if we go further up and further in to who God made us to be I think that's what that might be one of the things that CS Lewis is alluding to is that we're approaching that that fullness and completeness of who God made us to be and that has now become my perspective okay where I need to be I need to be I need to embody to use a Peter Sonian thing term because that was the first time anyone had ever said like you need to embody what it means to be Christ or what it means to be you know the hero in your own story like I think embodiment is closer to is not so much doing you know a list of things but but being you know that's the evolution that's taken place and that's so now I don't have that perspective where I'm longing for the fullness of the spirit and you know longing for that high it's more of no I need to engage with the person of Jesus and become and become who he made me to be and if you can help me nuance that because I don't know how right that is I oh that is right you know and I and I you know I I mean we're talking over zoom and in a one-hour conversation we have four minutes left but how does that happen oh that happens all the time it's good when it happens what's really bad is when you're talking over zoom and you realize there's a half hour left it's like oh gosh so when there's four minutes left that's a good thing well it's a good thing because the hour went quickly and and that means that it was engrossing and it was there was it was good institutions you have to worry about institutions institutions are when there are lots of people that have to form one body and you don't have that right now you know you know a wife never came up in the in the conversation you have a best friend who you baptized so there you go you already done that um most ridiculous thing I've ever done well it's it's it's youthful license to do ridiculous things and you know so so I think you know I think keep you know keep keep doing what you're doing in terms of thinking and searching and you know there is there is a fair amount of anxiety in your story and it's it's usually pointless to tell anxious people to not be anxious because that's what they do and and the funny thing about I'm more and more convinced that the funny thing about anxiety and anger and many of these emotions is that we have them and then we look around for opportunities to um to blame them upon so you know if you have you done Peterson's big five personality um test yeah how's your neuroticism score um I could look it up I could sign in because actually I don't don't bother right now but I think kind of high I don't think it was any higher than than 60% oh okay well I'm at one percent so I'm an outlier um um but I but you know what I'm what I'm saying is you know you're so you decided to be a youtuber 3d printer guy and you made a couple videos and some of them blew up you know what that says it says it says you're not incompetent you maybe you're lucky but you're not incompetent and so you know you seem to be able to have people put you in front of churches to play music and to have people in front of you as your friends and your parents let you back into their house that means you have good parents so you know um you're not a lost cause and I don't see I've I've I've and I think I think you've you know from just listening to your story you know it sounds to me like you've got initiative in some ways and you've got some leadership gifts people are willing to follow you you're able to organize some things and have them flourish and there's a um I'll give you a book recommendation um awesome uh David Brooks the road to character the road to character and it's a lovely book it's all these tiny little it's it's biographies for the adhd because not I remember very long but the the um I don't remember it's the second or the third biography this woman became secretary of the interior or secretary of labor something like that and and David Brooks has this really nice way of showing that you know later in life in a sense you know the calling found the moment and calling is something that elicits it out of you and I think um you see here's the thing we're we're really impatient creatures because we're really short-lived but God takes his time with us and our stories and um I I have nothing from this conversation brings me to imagine that God isn't working with you and on you and through you or that he is about to stop so I'd say be of good cheer yeah well I feel like that's what you're seeing right now yeah like I I was I was I just had this feeling you know I was like a weak so I started pursuing a conversation with you out of that desperation out of that patience yeah and when you know when I felt you know the spirit moving if I dare say that you know on this channel um you say that on this channel what I felt the spirit moving that night and into the next day um I was like okay this just happened you know and um now what do I do yeah it's you know it like the spirit is alive and well and obviously God is working and I wanted to throw the last eight years you know into the trash and now I I really can't and I don't I never should have no and he won't let you know but I gotta go because I got an 11 o'clock well thank you for I got an 11 o'clock well thank you so much Paul but we'll talk again you uh you're humoring me and say hi to miles for me and congratulations on his baptism I will thank you all right and I will send this video to you and you can let me know what you want to do with it awesome thanks okay Andrew bye-bye bye
