 Okay, I just finished making my turn this a little bit just finished making my video about Jordan Peterson and Barry Weiss I want to get back into that but I Want to play some of rebel wisdoms recent video with Zack Stein because So trying to lay people out on the landscape here And so here we have Jordan Peterson and Barry Weiss and they're quite close together in terms of where they are at the end of that video you sort of had that moment of The you know that the wounded lions Can't say it any better than Jordan. I mean she's Jordan's just Jordan's just the master of this and and there we have Barry Weiss and she's you know, this is the moment to give our all and You know Jordan, I mean the earnestness twins these two are But if you're thinking that what we can do is take a step back and hold That's not gonna happen maybe take a step back and try and go a new direction because I also think that the The woke the woke won't work. The woke won't work. It just will not work. It will eat itself We've got ample we've got ample evidence of that. Just watch Benjamin Benjamin voices channel. It won't work You're just gonna keep eating yourselves to death. It's not a path that leads to life. Well, what will lead to life now, of course, I'm a Christian minister and so Listen to my sermons and I talk about that there and so for the someone who's gonna say let more Jesus and less Jordan Well, okay Watch my church channel and you'll get plenty of Jesus and to say that I don't I'm not I'm not trying to draw a comparison between them But I want to pay attention to the present moment and the various communities and where they're going and So in the strange estuary that I'm in the middle of We've got the IDW types like Jordan and Brett Weinstein and and Barry Weiss we've got the IDW types, but we've also got the verveky types and That group as well as the Orthodox and the Roman Catholics and the Protestants So we're all we're all here swimming in the estuary together and It's helpful because you know sort of in that estuary moment in this conversation between Barry and Jordan Okay. Well, we got an estuary. Let's keep talking Zach is a philosopher of education who coined the term a time between worlds the broader sense that the time between worlds was like Catalyzed that there was a sense that everyone became aware of the Liminality of the position of the human and now I Know that just triggered some of you If I really triggered your heart, you're probably not you know, you're used to it. I I trigger lots I'm an equal opportunity trigger in this space So He's actually talking between heaven and earth so we're you know Part of the reason Peugeot every now and then can be found on rebel wisdom and talks to verveky is Even though in some ways they're sort of on different sides of this and there I'm the Protestant in the middle in Other ways, this is back where we're at. I mean John verveky in his awakening from the meaning crisis wants to get away from a two worlds mythology But with Zack Stein, we're sort of back in it and and we're between these worlds and the question is okay. Well What do we know of heaven and in a lot of ways that is the question and that's where of course Christians come in with A lot more detail because they say well, I think we actually know some things about that Instead of always trying to sort of project up from below because of course in in contemporary secularity There's a real skepticism about what can be seen from below or what can be received from above But but you know right away here. It's between worlds. So you know when after I'd listened to David Fuller and Jonathan Rouse and I listened to this and I thought yeah the first part of this video now some of where it goes Not everybody's gonna like but the first part Just pay attention because that's the point of the Barry Weiss Jordan Peterson There's no sort of holding our present position or saying no one step back and that's far enough There's no Humanity keeps moving and and really the only question is where is the telos in heaven that you're actually going to be moving towards? I think that Continues He's also a co-founder of the consilience project with Daniel Schmachtenberger Which is aimed at improving the information landscape and of sparking a cultural Renaissance That's a really interesting guy and this was a great conversation. So I hope you enjoy it. So Zach I want to start with that now this little this little Zoom square thing so rebel wisdom does that and I think that's a I don't know the nomenclature that they use a member or But anyway, you know, that's that's So when I listen to Barry Weiss and Jordan talking about I Would participate in one of these last week with them with Jonathan Roussen and I don't know You know what David's gonna do with the recording, but anyway, it's fine. But you know, I really Congratulate David on doing this kind of thing because what Jordan and Barry are talking about in some ways David is doing now You might not agree the heaven that David is sort of pointing to But he's at least in some ways putting together a congregation You know again back to maybe I'll play it again Maybe this is gonna be one of the videos I just play over and over and over and over again That's why I put it on my Vanderclips channel I Wanted to start maybe with Tara's point about sort of the You know the durability of this kind of I'll conflate your two points and say the durability of imminent individualist religion in American life, right and the fact that you have plenty of you know, now the UK is very much a part of this because in some ways America, you know, they went in different traditions, but seldom do Seldom do Americans go on a trippy Tour of religion and at least the the Brits didn't start it or follow along Divination and God within spirituality going back to the 18th century It seems to me that if you look at sort of the historical pattern in American life, you have sort of either surges of that kind of spirituality or particular religious genes Surges of that kind of spirituality or particular religious geniuses who manifest it and then the movements and Institutions that they build have historically then been sort of pulled back towards a kind of normative Christian structure or framework to to use to use Steve's account, right? So, you know to take to take the examples of the the two biggest 19th century examples Maybe our Christian science which comes out of new thought in certain ways and Mormonism which gets its start in the sort of in you know the kind of divination happy world of upstate New York and in the in the in the early 19th century that that's You know, I know for some people trigger wisdom trigger wisdom rebel wisdom might trigger you a little bit, but You might look at Mormonism say oh what a conservative religion and they are They sort of preserved, you know when I talked about Jordan and Barry sort of trying to preserve something Mormonism tries to preserve Something I remember when I first visited there, you know their complex in Salt Lake City and toured their museum I thought this is the most American religion I can imagine. They really are So so what happens when you preserve something like that? You sort of you sort of seal it in time and try to hold on to it as is but that's only one part of Mormonism the other part of Mormonism is that it is a prophetic religion. So they always have these prophets coming and you know revising the prophecies and and so in that way they're they're quite a bit like rebel wisdom, even though rebel wisdom is is much more inhabiting the Fog the bright fog of secularism Rebellious Rebel wisdom is doing the same thing and so the visions and the dreams and the integral and spiral dynamics and the the You know the men's work the the psychedelics the meditation the Eastern ideas That's all part of it and you might look at Mormonism and say well, that's that's the opposite of Mormonism But no, not really not really and Both of those, you know if you if you look at them from a sort of you know, how Christian are they perspective at at at the outset you can Make a case that they're both pretty stark departures Maybe not getting all the way to something we call paganism or post Christianity, but clearly really stark departures You know in Mormonism case, you know, you mentioned polyamory, right? As a feature of the contemporary political landscape early Mormonism goes all the way to polygamy and Then over the course of the next hundred years you get to a point whereby the time of the 1950s and 1960s both Christian science and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints while they're still regarded as heretical or dangerous or cultic by some other Christian denominations are I think reasonably seen as Connected to a kind of you know, I kind of Christian tradition in okay now I Think the reason for this dynamic is that is the only way these new traditions can actually last My example of this is the Oneida community and I've mentioned this book over time It's a great book if you want a fascinating read about the dynamics of religion, especially when it comes to Sexuality the 19th century and and how they morph and shape in the 20th century I mean, here's a community that practiced free love practiced You know, they practiced eugenics read a little bit from the introduction John Humphrey noise and his followers Edmund wrote had been Christian perfectionists religious dissidents and reformers in the best American tradition intent on reforming a community Resembling the early church as described in the Acts of the Apostles and calling themselves Bible communists noise and his followers pooled all their possessions and lived and worked together as an extended family Trived striving to become one body in Christ through total selflessness But if they sought to restore the communal harmony of the age of the Apostles noise and his band of Bible Communists were no starry died romantics as the twin dynamos of the Market Revolution and the Industrial Revolution were Transfiguring the American landscape in the 1840s John Humphrey noise and his followers energetically embraced capitalism and the technological wizardry of the modern age Era from the steam engine to the telegraph as the wings that would bring to fruition the New Jerusalem pride loose from their selfish interests of the property owning few and Transformed into the servant of communism and the spirit of heaven modern Capitalism would usher in a reign of peace and plenty unknown since Adams expulsion from the Garden of Eden again It's utopian now, of course, this is before the communism of Angle, you know and And the Soviet Union Edmunds went on to explain in the first hundred years that while the Oneida community had dissolved as a social and religious entity in 1880 the bold experiment in human relations initiated by noise senior Had carried forth in the economic sphere by noises son Pierpont and his fellow community Descendants who took the old pictures of sharing inequality Inherit from his father and applied them to the industrial production of silverware Oneida limited pride in itself on the equity and dignity that it that it That it accorded all of its members from the lowest factory hand to the president of the company itself It was in an institution that true to the founders principles held that every man and woman whose work Contributed contributes to the success of the company is entitled to an equitable share in the company's profits Pricing the common good over private and individual interests Edmunds commemorative history closes with a section of glossy back at black and white photos from the company and its homey small-town environments from the village block hardware store Merchandises displayed on the sidewalks in a neighborly way to the stately trees surrounding the old communal homestead proud of their ancient lineage and living reminders of the thought and vision of those who painted them who planted them generations ago and It was a wild place and Again, I highly recommend the book. It's it is on it is on audible it's a terrific read if you want to get a sense of If you want to get a sense of How variable we can be but again to get to the point that doubt that is about to make that I will play Look at the form and shape that they followed as a community Notice the difference today in terms of platforms I'm on sub stack. I'm not complaining about YouTube or sub stack or Twitter I'm in all those places and I do so as a Christian minister and I minister in a local congregation But the platform question has been disrupted and Now when Barry Weiss and Jordan Peterson asked themselves how we can take a step back and reclaim Whether it's Jordan Peterson know what at what age just Jordan Peterson want to go back to does he want to go back to? Maybe 2000 before 9-eleven does Barry Weiss. She's not gonna want to go back any you know any less than 2013 In order to save her marriage. So where are we going with this? And what are the platforms that we're using? In American life and there's clearly an aspiration at least among parts of the leadership of those of those what become those churches to move in that direction and What's that hasn't it seems to me one thing that's been different since the 60s and 70s, right? Is that that hasn't happened to the same degree, right? So we've gone through the sort of Mary Ann Williamson presidential campaign, which Unfortunately has not won enough support to merit the fascination that I've applied to it But I feel like a 19th century version of Mary Ann Williamson would have started a church right and would have You know and and over the course of 50 years there would be a sort of Williamsonian denomination that had some sort of ambiguous relationship to The Protestant Center in American life and you know Williamson has some kind of institution now But it's very clear that she doesn't regard herself as in that light and the same goes for you know Figures ranging from Deepak Chopra to Oprah Winfrey and so on and so I'm curious what you think His question was better than her answer. So I'll leave it there So again back to rebel wisdom To what degree does as David Fuller established a congregation and you know in a session like this well even just the Even just the the zoom squares are nearly Sacramental because they talk of well, we're all joining the conversation. So deeply egalitarian Yeah You know, we're also going to have you know a little sermon at the outset and then you can ask questions and you know So what we're doing and I'm not critiquing David. I went and when I was there last week I said good for you. Keep doing this This is important and I'm doing the same thing in my own way with my Friday question and answer on discord I've got to get the local meetup going again here in Sacramento after that probably Another meetup tour to probably help meet up start in different places. So You know, I'm swimming in this estuary here. That's what we're doing But I think Zach Stein is right where you know We're looking at heaven and earth and and what we're doing in a lot of ways is saying well What we really have to do is sort of talk about heaven. Well, why what do you mean by that? Because in this dynamic heaven is is where we're going. It's the good. It's the ideal It's it's it's where all things should finally Finally attained to and of course in Christianity you have the marriage of heaven and earth in the book of Revelation, so Concept of a time between worlds because Implicit in that is the idea that we're moving from one world and I think a lot of people have talked about that the kind of sense of civilization or collapse or Certainly the end of a way of being that many of the people in rebel wisdom have spoken to But also there's a suggestion there that there is a destination do you have a sense of what that destination is and So when Barry Weiss sort of pauses, maybe it's a different video. So maybe I should play it I still got them all sort of queued up here Also on sub stack and I think it's extremely interesting the thing that I think is a Challenge like an IDW of journalists. Yeah, I mean the thing that I think is is challenging right is If you're like a dentist or an accountant or a lawyer and I meet a lot of these people and they say I don't trust the New York Times anymore. What do I read? I need a new clergy Well, it's a really dissatisfying answer because I'm like well You need to subscribe to these ten sub stacks and listen to these five podcasts and follow these thirty people on Twitter No, like that's not gonna work. So so in some ways You know David Fuller has lots of voices under his channel. So he's he's in a sense Doing a similar thing to Barry, but I think he's a little further down the road But he's also coming out of journalism. Remember he's one commenter I don't mean any disrespect to anyone who's been on David's channel, but That's one commenter said David Wilson says, you know The reason I don't like rebel wisdom is because David Wilson says things better than anybody who brings on his channel Which is both kind of you know flattering and Though I am extremely interested in in what I've been referring to like how do I make a common address? For that sensibility that independent minded. Okay, so it's a sensibility Spirit that you know is not like centrist in the sense of like just finding the middle path But is able to see truth on on But is able to separate let's say identity from ideas and is able to say yeah that person maybe sucks on this thing But they're really right about that like so That's heaven. She's trying to describe. She's trying to get there where the others are are trying to go In specific no in specific no and there is Suggestion there that there is a destination. Do you have a sense of what that destination is? In specific no in specific no, and I'm not gonna critique him for that answer because I Can use religious terminology But that's punting You want me to get specific and I again? I'll give you religious terminology and a bunch of you will hear it as religious Terminology and it'll put you off and then I'll tell stories and then I'll give images and then I'll give illustrations and that will help you a little bit more and But within this congregation He's got here. There's already a fair amount of commonality which has gathered them because you sort of get gathered You can't put the words on it But you sort of know it when you see it and so it draws you and or maybe it's not this but that and And there is in when you're in the position of being You know between worlds Which you say is and that's both Dyslexic so I can ever get the put in front of my face. It'll be on the camera There's between worlds this way, but there's also sort of between worlds this way and so Jordan Jordan and Barry are you know, okay, we're gonna stop we're gonna stop history at this point. I Don't know I I I don't I don't want to say that that's what they're saying Because I don't know that if that would be fair because I think both of them would say no That's not what I'm saying, but I would have to say okay, but you're gonna have to tell me where this is You can't just say well, we reached the peak before the wokeness started That's not good enough Poetic, but it's actually basically a sociological construct that I took from Emanuel Wallerstein It's a very specific techno-economic position were between the basic structures of institutions and so in a sense that we're in that kind of hard fork or catastrophic bifurcation of a complex dynamical system situation where This wouldn't cut it unless you're talking to a whole bunch of people who are quite well read are pretty wonky on this Terminology but in all fairness to them, this is another sort of religious language Because if I were to translate it into christianese a whole bunch of other people Would understand what I'm saying because christianese is still fairly broadly spoken in America But less so with every increasing year yet The ideas beneath the christianese are still out there in terms of our movie movies and just about everything else There's a destination. It's either higher-order coherence or lower order Recoherence which in this case probably isn't possible given the existence of nuclear reactors and and other again So some of you are gonna listen to this and say I don't know what this dude is talking about Just just bear with me. He's got a couple of things that you are gonna understand things. So So yeah, we're looking for a way Through the eye of the needle towards some kind there's some words from Jesus and of more complex more coherent way of Getting humans to cooperate at scale and my concern being getting humans to educate at scale So his background is education getting humans to actually transform Capacity their own internal capacity not technological capacity, which is important. We need to figure out so in verveky terms That's agency how to do all of that stuff But in order to do that the prerequisite is actually getting our skills in order getting our Mindsets and emotional dispositions and those kinds of things in order Now none of this would cut mustard either in a Christian community or in sort of the socio-political community The the let's say the wavelength that Peterson and Barry Weiss are operating on and again part of David Fuller's critique of Peterson is that he and Weiss keeps sort of he doesn't talk about Weiss but Peterson keeps sort of Defaulting back to the political register and now Peterson's got a very broad spectrum So Peterson does do the political thing, but he also does the religious thing Which is what say Sam Harris will complain complain about and so there's there's a lot going on here so yeah, one of the aspects of the destination is Something like a a new personhood a new kind of personhood a new basic set of What earth does he mean by that? I'm already a person. Okay but remember when Weiss was talking about identity And Now we're starting to get a little closer of citizen capacities if you will and David oh, I'm gonna have to bring this down to earth a little bit more. Your focus is primarily on Education we do you say that it's primarily an educational crisis or do you feel that that's just your particular piece to hold? Okay, that was plain English we could understand that If you define education the way I define it, which is much more broadly than just schools Then I think you could you could make the argument that in a sense the the crisis that contains all of the other smaller crises This is one way I think about the meta crisis That crisis that contains all of the other crises is something like a crisis of the human mind It's a crisis of our ability to grapple and hold the situation And then still pretty Come on down. Come on down. Got it. Got to use language a lot of other folks can understand But we're gonna get there. Hold on and to change our capacities and orientation to the situation So when you think about deep adaptation It is both technological and psychological and I believe psychology is maybe the primary mover here So in that sense broadly construed it is fundamentally an educational crisis so you mean yes There are crises in the schools, but I define education as though that whole process of intergenerational transmission which can be fundamentally disrupted and And has been a catastrophic bifurcation of intergenerational transmission is a civilizational collapse vector and Basically to translate he'd say that's kind of what's going on right now we're having some of that not all of it not as bad as it could be but there's Something has disrupted Long the long-standing capacity with inhuman communities to pass down Knowing how to live at a very basic level let's say it that way If you will it's one of the things that happens when civilization collapses no matter what but it's also can happen as one of the things that kind of causes it to more rapidly occur the Abrupt and profound loss of skill and capacity and emotional disposition and those things And It's pulling back down again You I've heard you describe it as a loss of teacherly authority Does that is that the core? Ah David knows words that people know loss of teacherly authority Or a bit would you say Surely authority does that is that the core of it would you say? It's one way to think about the core of it. It's one of the things that is Essential to amend as part of any resolution the the kind of The the diagnostic if you will does it expands beyond just the collapse of teacherly authority that is something that characterizes our Situation but we're looking at a a multi institutional educational crisis essentially this is where we get back to the What the Jordan Peterson Barry Weiss conversation because it's multi institutional you'll hear Jordan Peterson The real crisis. Well, let's see. How can I say it? Jordan Peterson saw this crisis in his own shop Let's say it that way and and at the heart of Peterson's cry his religious cry That that you see in the Barry Weiss Jordan Peterson conversation is the loss of The Academy to facilitate at least its share of Teacherly authority and what Zach sign Zach Stein was saying with all of those fancy words and So yeah the collapse of teacherly authority, which is to say the absence of those contexts in which You can exercise that holistic intergenerational transmission, right? That is a key node. So it's good that you've identified that yeah in some sense that is the core of it and How did we get here How did we get here that's the broader question, right? Yeah, if the problem I mean the collapse of teacherly authority I think is a when I first heard you say that it made a lot of sense and was really helpful frame But I just wonder if we could unpack that a little bit and How have we got there? Is it is it mostly the impact of technology? Is it a bigger shift between? kind of like the the the Generation gap has now become a chasm in some ways. I mean, what are the what are the factors that have led to this place? Where we're at now where we see very adrift Yes, it's definitely multi multifactorial, you know If you like Marshall McLuhan Then you look at something like the basic paradigmatic shifts and communications technologies from print to electric to digital At each one of those you had major educational and I get print to mass electric to Individual personal digital Crisis major educational crisis now in each one of those up to the digital which is the one we're in you had Educational crises in context we didn't have existential technology Which is the same technology that can destroy the whole planet and all the humans So it's okay if everyone got confused for 30 or 40 years like happened at the end of the long 16th century with 30 years war after the printing press finally took hold and Catholic Church invented propaganda and had this Total warfare including informational warfare. I'd say the Protestants were pretty good at propaganda, too Which was an educational crisis and you could argue as maybe Alexander Bard might that that whole route from the Renaissance to the Enlightenment Was about dealing with the implications of the printing press So you could argue similarly were in a situation where the digital has disrupted intergenerational transmission and we're in that So that's one round I think that's certainly true and I agree but there are other ones, you know the economic The way economic systems began to superordinately kind of like design educational systems which I call reductive human capital theory Where the educational system becomes a servant to the economy where the whole point of the school? Is to fix the economic system This is another thing the importing now if you know any Of the constant intramural Warfare with an education You can locate some of this what he's talking about here because this these have been like these little wars in education And so my wife's an educator so I you know over here some of these little warfares and little schools, but again that that's Schools then there's there's in America. You've got public schools Which are the the default school systems, but they're you know, there's school boards and localities and even in a place like Sacramento There's the sac unified school district when there's other school districts around and so You've got some of that but then you've got private education and so that it's not unlike the church Landscape and then the same with with With University education used to be colleges. Okay, I went to Calvin College now it's Calvin University everything's gonna be a university because colleges are kind of these little sub things and Internationals when they hear you have a degree from college Calvin College. That's the Colegio. That's the high school. No, no, no, it's it's it's a college Anyway, so so there's all this stuff going on thing of market models financializations of education 1972 creation of the student loan the corporation in the United States These things were part of it, right? I think you also have a Factor which again has been playing out since the end of the long 16th century the beginning of this This world that we're leaving The family right the family as a target of Of Cult colonization and commodification That the family's been disrupted first by Labor systems now, I know some of you out there and I started playing this rebel wisdom video your eyes rolled back and you thought Oh boy, here we go. But then you heard him say this and sounds like oh, oh And then by communications technologies and now by Biomedical technologies the the medicalization of the family structure and the medicalization of academic underperformance. So there's been Kind of some major dynamics in the kind of like basic unit of families What do you mean by the medicalization of family structure there? So it's It's one of the ways you can think about the family and the things that used to be handled in the context of family as being transferred into kind of bureaucratic management, which also ends up being like a Profit extraction center. So like when you're dealing with an ill or sick relative or dying relative I remember Obama speaking to this once that you're dealing with insurance paperwork Like you're having these conversations in the hospital, of course But you're also dealing with insurance paperwork dealing with financial strain dealing with complex systems of authority and medical decision-making which Outstrip your capacity to actually resist them and so used to be your the religious authority showed up and you hung around the bedside and you did what you could and Person was sick and died and that was held in what how many would call the life world Some of you are thinking So as the family system First gets brought into like okay now you're regulating your whole day based on the wage labor system and then it gets brought into you're regulating another TV and the rhythms of what is broadcast and when And now it's being even More higher order regulated in terms of a whole bunch of dynamics including this by me So and suddenly all the conservatives are like, hey, wait a minute We've been talking about that for a while And again, this is part of what our Basic institutions are convinced and since built to do there there in a sense benignly carrying out their Defective generator functions if you will as Schmuck where you would would put it so it's not some conspiracy to take over the family. It's about Building medical systems and insurance systems in a certain way Building broadcast technologies in a certain way Eventually building digital technologies like your phone in a certain way. So we've been paying a lot of attention to platforms Marianne Williamson if she had lived in the 19th century would have started a church Billy Graham didn't start a church. There's no Graham ism around although we maybe could use that term Billy Graham and the neo-evangelicals in the middle of the 20th century in North America Modulated what was the the fundamentalist movement and took off some of the the sharper edges of it and popularized it and You know again, Jordan Peterson in the first wave was a pretty potent Was a pretty potent Movement but nothing like Billy Graham Billy Graham's was far more long-lasting Billy Graham's Jordan Peterson could fill the Sacramento Theatre, you know 2,500 3,000 people you know, maybe even one in Dublin to 10,000 people for a major talk with with Douglas Murray and Sam Harris but Billy Graham filled Yankee Stadium Billy Graham changed him and had a whole network of churches between him and called them down and But he didn't really start a church but he didn't turn his way from the church Christianity today was sort of the masthead Fuller Seminary so you can see More, you know left the 19th century into the 20th century and you can see the platforms changing but now These platforms that Zack Stein are talking about, you know I have members of my church that could remember when they were children when their grandpa died you Laid him out in the house Now and then the next iteration after that was the funeral home. Well, what? What is it? What is so home ish about a funeral? well, you call it a funeral home because you used to lay out grandpa in the house and This one member of the church. He's no longer alive himself now But he said, you know he his grandpa was laying downstairs and he was a little boy and he didn't want to go downstairs because there's there's dead grandpa laying in the hallway in the front hall where people would come in and you know have Calling hours. Well, what on earth is calling hours and funeral homes funeral homes calling hours these are all vestiges of what was still happening in the early part of the 20th century and You know now Zack sign is is pointing to all of these changes all of these changes that have happened and Well, there's there's another thing that I want to get to I don't remember in detail everything he's about to say now Maybe I'll play a little bit more of it Where the screen now runs interference between family conversation in a pretty systematic way? And then what you're reading on the screen is imported into family conversation to disrupt what used to be community and Care, so so that's a little that's a little bit. So it's multi institutional generational crisis Then you get things like those postmodern critical theory The kind of turn towards complexity science and a whole bunch of other factors that also made teacherly authority in particular very very very vexed and that's Now you're seeing the connections aren't you Part of the breakdown the schools contributed to that because many teachers have teacher the authority by virtue of having bureaucratic authority Whereas legitimate teacher the authority is held by virtue of having actual epistemic asymmetry Epistemic asymmetry What? epistemic Asymmetry they know more than you but not just bureaucratic They now we get back to Jordan Peterson they live it out They practice it they know how to act in the world How to act in the world in order to what in order to move up? Jacob's Ladder and get closer to heaven to move up. They know how to have success in life to do better That makes sense And so to the degree that the school sees the work people become critical of the idea of teacher the authority because they mostly encounter bureaucratized context and then you get the Media like the New York Times or Fox or whatever, which is also supposed to be holding some teacher the authority. They obviously become problematic So everyone's looking around where who is the person I can trust? with the future of my mind Where can I look for guidance especially from elders? About the ways of the world both what is legitimate in terms of authority Both what makes sense in terms of the world and what's meaning making and the meaning crisis is also Part of the cascade of the underlying educational crisis So yes, the absence of teacher the authority thrown into the mix of that technological disruption of Family, etc. Puts us in a pretty dicey spot Which is not a spot of total like incapacitation, but a spot of very diverse and stratified Capacity and educational opportunity. So we're having people who are smarter than people have ever been Now you're gonna have to ask what do you mean by smart Now again What you mean by smart actually that this gets into you know What I want to get into in the Jordan Peterson Barry Weiss conversation which is underneath that conversation is Both Jordan and Barry have a an Assumption of a world they have an assumption of the location of heaven with a degree of specificity and saying we reliably could We reliably could make our way to heaven via the New York Times it had authority And what both of them lament with the loss of the Lions and the Tigers is that those authorities are gone and What do we do? Teacherly authority is disrupted and we no longer have it like crazy ridiculously exposed to unprecedented material Kids even talk with NASA scientists in the spaceship and stuff like I didn't do that But This is very quick kids talk to Scientists and I didn't do that when I was a kid Well, but does that mean anything so so again if you you know, of course for Jordan Peterson the the crisis of the Academy was critical and Maybe I should jump into the jump into the other conversation Maybe a little more of this And saturated with this information with no access to anything like you have to send my comments or Okay saturated with this information so I am a person who sits in the middle of so much of this stuff and so thanks to you because you know you've You've made me quite a bit more aware of conservatism than I had been before So, thank you and some of you will feel quite proud and happy about that. So there you go Have I been red-pilled you can decide? But I listen to both sides oh they they don't they don't know what they're talking about because they only read And then it's the New York Times or it's Fox News They don't know what they're talking about, but we know what we're talking about because we read the New York Times or false news the epistemic commons the epistemic commons gets at well the truth objective objectivity Subjectivity is personal objectivity is what we all need to the monarchical vision again. If you've watched my videos You know, we talked about this kind of stuff all the time What is the truth well it isn't just that you know lots of people who read Fox you who watch Fox News and a lots of people who Read the New York Times they actually have a lot in common in terms of a lot of things but Which truth the relevant truth? How how how can we know? Good faith argumentation even when the bureaucracy is like schools that are supposed to attend to them in that manner I'd love to in a second come to sort of solutions. I know you're involved with the consilience project I know you're involved with the consilience project. So that's one that's one project that's operating in this space before before that you wrote this Essay, I think I've just checked it out is at the end of March Last year so in the kind of early throws of kovat called a war broke out in heaven That's a good title It was at the time where everything like it was a really intense time and I reread Parts of it just before and you you mentioned in it Kind of referring to the horsemen of the apocalypse the great un patterning this sense that I think a lot of us had back then of this real intensity and maybe a lot of us who've been talking about systems change or some kind of shift Shift for kind of into new cut kinds of beings as you've talked about Had this sense that this was it this was the crisis that was going to accelerate that kind of shift I'm really interested now to look back at that and say did we overplay it? Dude, the Millerites are on top of the hill. Jesus is coming right now He didn't the Jehovah's Witnesses Jesus is coming they had all sorts of dates you can look them up Noise Seventh-day Adventists Adventists The language has changed but This basic pattern pattern pattern pattern pattern pattern pattern That's a Peugeot mean it's basic pattern Continues to play Do you think that? Do you look back at that essay and does it still stand up? Or do you think that we maybe got caught up in some of this kind of intensity of the moment back then We're all liable it's an interesting question. I actually haven't looked at that essay in a while Does how Lindsay really go back and think about 1980 countdown to Armageddon It's interesting that there's a sense that the crisis is over at least that there's a sense that we want the crisis to be over And that there's a turning in the larger narratives towards articulating a sense that the crisis is over I think my argument was that we're at the be where it's the end of the beginning And that we're in a cascading set of compounding crises So the broader sense that The time between worlds was like Catalyzed that there was a sense that everyone became aware of the Liminality of the position of the human And and in that in some ways Barry Weiss is well, she's aware now and she's like, let's go back 2013 that was the peak And I think that Continues so i'll be curious to see like I I think the question is in a sense premature Like, you know, I suggested that because of what occurred there was an opening in the imaginal Which occurs when you're between worlds when you're solidly in a world basically your imagination Kind of works like your your models you throw out Imagination kind of works like your your models you throw out are predictive and You know the the things you say to others are understood and that like the world is working when the when you're between worlds Then actually you're forced to expand the imagination. So when this thing first hit in march there was a sense of What would happen? It wasn't clear what the paths that would emerge were and so there was a time of totally wide open Imagination both towards the good and the bad like the terrible and the amazing so that whole thing opened up very apocalyptic For a lot of people at the same time And that's so that's the notion of the time between worlds and the notion of the war in heaven is what takes place in people's imaginations Everyone's not just us all at all strata of society. All the highest power players are also like whoa opportunity uh now remember Barry Weiss wants to find we need to we've got all these little substacks out We need to we need to coalesce. Well, that's that happens in heaven, you know Point up you pay attention to it I can't help myself got to jump into this video But then Like when I listen to you or JP Marceau or someone else you talk about this idea of emanation, right? So I want to I want to look at an example, right? Because oh I do this and I didn't tell you what i'm going to do drives my wife crazy when I do this stuff So here's heaven Well, it's all about pointing to heaven How can how what what is I mean that's where that's where that's where david fuller started is it? Well, maybe you can tell us what heaven is One of the things that that the problem is going to be easier to see emanation at a human scale because it's it has to do with intelligence Now again, if you go back to the pageau for veki conversations, these two are always talking about emergence Which is bottom up and emanation which is top down and again in the secular society we have For a variety of reasons deep skepticism about Emanation we have a degree of confidence and emergence and I think there are psychological Uh reasons for that, but I won't go there right now It's going to be harder to see it at a biological like low level It's there but it's harder to see it's easier to see at a human level like so if you deal with human Okay, so let's say I I I found a city Okay, I talked about this on my channel recently. It's like i'm constantine And i'm the king i'm the emperor and then I found a city and so I come and I do a sacred ritual I will take a lance and I will like walk behind an angel to like mark the limit of the city and and and so So I actually give it a name. I found it. I give it a name and then it From that will a city will will appear like people will start to congregate around that center and will start to To to to do the things people in cities do around that sacred gesture that I did Like so in the in the uh, let's say there there's there is right nearby where I live. There's a town Now this is all around authority Constantine has authority which is recognized and so when he plants the lance And so he plants Marking the boundary of the city you can watch peugeot. He has a video recently about constantine and and constantinople That the first thing in the town that was built was a church And so they built a church, which is a common place a place of unity where everybody congregates and worships the same thing And then you know a few decades later There was an entire town built around the church So that's a form you could say like that's a form of understanding causality from above which is you found you name you You know, you create a Coherence and then the world kind of comes in and manifests Manifest from from you know, so founding a company founding anything that is almost human needs to have an aspect of eminence that you can easily perceive for it to for it to exist like For a group to exist it has to have a name you have to name it Right, and so it's like you have a band you get a bunch of guys together But it's like, okay, so if we're going to exist we need a name And so then you name the band and the name of the band like if you name the band, uh, the name a name that sounds like uh, Like a pop band or if you name the band that a name that sounds like a like a death metal band Because those actually can be recognized in the name It will affect so you couldn't have like a death metal name And then make pop songs because it'll be so incoherent that it's going to break apart So you need to have so in the name and in the image and in this kind of founding you need a you need a type of coherence Uh, so that's a form of that's a form of form of eminence But I mean there there are so many but they're a lot easier to see for sure in human in the human sphere But I mean can't you? I mean can't you see that that that emanation itself is derived from an emergence It's a it's a it's both happening at the same time But you can't only see it as as as emergent like you can't it doesn't like at least to me like the founding of uh, the especially the idea of like the The idea of the founding of something Because there's a whole idea that we remember the founding It's like why do we remember the founding if it's just emergence like we we Tell ourselves the story of the founding of the united states. We tell ourselves the story of these these sacred Moments that are the origin of a of a of a community Because it actually binds the community together Okay back to this video what you're seeing is emanation what you're not yet seeing is Um, what you're seeing is emergence what you're not yet seeing is emanation If you're like a dentist or an accountant or a lawyer and I meet a lot of these people and they say I don't trust the new York times anymore. What do I read? The law what is the new york times lost its lost authority Well, it's a really dissatisfying answer because i'm like well You need to subscribe to these 10 sub stacks and listen to these five podcasts and following these 30 people on twitter No, like that's not going to work So I am extremely interested in in what i've been referring to like how do I make a common address? for that sensibility She's waiting to become a prophet that independent-minded spirit That you know is not like centrist in the sense of like just finding the middle path, but is able to see truth on on But is able to see that's all emergence. It's all it's it's not that There she's waiting for emanation Separate let's say identity from ideas and is able to say yeah that person maybe sucks on this thing But they're really right about that Like that's what i'm that vander clay. He's a calvinist, but he's really right about Whatever you think i'm right about interested in building and so the way that started off for me and i'm proud of it is you know commissioning op-eds and columns and reported pieces from Voices that you know don't have the platform that I think that they should But where did she do that from she did that from a platform she did that from the new york times Um and trying to elevate them to my readers, but it's going to be you know, my podcast podcast network and ultimately I podcast network Going to compete with apple and spotify and google So now suddenly the platforms matter if you follow brett weinstein on twitter, I mean he's been You know he's been making a lot of noise because Um youtube took down I don't remember the name of the drug begins with an i if I say it maybe YouTube will take down this video too, but he's making make a lot of noise about a drug that was I listened to that video that he was um That's a drug that's A drug that's all over the place. It's you know cheap to make it's all over the world and at least some claim is very effective In terms of covet and youtube took down his video and so they'll take to twitter. They are the platforms So now sort of back to zack stein and say hey wait a minute all of these platforms have sort of Snuck up on us and we're between worlds. We're between worlds this way Because we need to we need that emanation we need the name We've got plenty of emergence, but emergence without emanation is just sort of flopping around on the dock It doesn't have direction. It doesn't it's not incorporated Yeah, and it was also I mean this this connects it back to your initial question, which is what the hell happened at the new york times in a way that answer to that begins In college because that was the first time that I started to encounter What has been called critical social justice or critical race theory or wokeness or what rodre's called soft totalitarianism? Or really cultural and moral notice how we're still sort of Flopping about for names wokeness soft totalitarian I mean I I I called it progressive liberationism when I first started dealing with this in my Church life and began listening to certain I mean because again I had been a reliable I mean the left of the christian reform church is not very left in terms of the national spectrum But I had very much been a part of the left of the christian reform church And I began listening very carefully to others and say hey wait a minute I Things are changing and I don't have names for it And what am I watching and there's a lot of a lot of emergence bubbling up Relativism to put it more simply Now relativism if you'd use that word you sort of went back to culture warrior You went back to 1980s culture war fights. I remember very very clearly getting into an argument with Another friend also identified as a feminist and she was justifying female genital mutilation to me because That's other people's culture and we need to respect it Okay now You can that that example is a really nice one because you can see things sort of come all the way full circle with respect To this and this is part of the reason that I never really said It's not really cultural relativism because we we sort of see that and can understand that but I want to talk about data and narrative and icons. Okay data is Comminutorial explosion the world is too big. We can't manage it all. How do we manage it? Are we manage it? We organize it via narrative Okay, we organize it via narrative and those narratives then it's how it selects what we can take in Because it fits the narrative and the things that don't really fit we sort of put over to the side And they'll sit there for a while and if not if the pile doesn't get too big it sort of decays and goes away But if this is koon and his paradigm shifts if the pile does get too big then suddenly we look at our narrative and say oh well The narrative might need to change a little bit because the pile is getting too big So then we can incorporate more things in our narrative adjusts or maybe we take somebody else's narrative and and that's sort of how Narrative and data work together You know not only does not only do we get a first draft from our parents First draft narratives and we use those to see the world again all the jordan peterson Sam harris conversations We're all about this a priori structure that we knew we need in order to filter to bring in the world so that it's accessible To us, so we have a first draft from our parents. I'm just i'm just you know, i'm I'm compressing a whole bunch of videos right now for you But then we also see the world through those narratives now i'm going to add a third ingredient to this called icons Female genital mutilation became an icon in certain communities It it became it was even so if narratives are massive compression engines and filters and selective engines Which we need in order to manage this too big world Icons are even more compressed. They're like They're like diamonds in that they're very hard and And so we use these icons to test Narratives, so we use narratives to test data. We use icons to test narratives. And so When her friend who was also a feminist there's identity Said she believed in you know, she wasn't going to be outraged by female genital mutilation Well now suddenly we're dealing at the icon level And yes, no icons are very binary. Yes. No. Yes No icon if it's you agree with the icon or you don't agree with the icon. It's a watershed Okay, and now the reason I use icon is that it's an image you see in a sense through To the narrative and yet it's also a function of the narrative and all these things go back and forth. Okay And and that's a very short summary into I think just a model of of cognition That that i'm thinking about as I watch all these videos I mean because this is all data and then I put it into narrative and then there are icons And and icons are of course deeply religious because they see through to other worlds And they see through in that sense to heaven I'm being crude, but that was the basic argument and I remember thinking What the hell? How can you possibly call yourself a feminist and believe in defending the rights of women and believe that women should be see there's the icon What what happened to your narrative? because Icons, you don't use so much. They're very static. They're very compressed. They're very hard They're very hard. They're they're sort of like stars in the sky Or let's say diamonds in the sky that we use to navigate But again, so you've got data you've got narrative you've got icons and so now testing the narrative and therefore the identity of her conversation partner be Safe and have equality of opportunity to men and also believe that female genital mutilation can be justified in any universe And so it was the first justified in any universe. It's a universal Okay This is this is I I don't like the language I'm increasingly i'm gonna have to do a words that fudge video on the word objective because it's it's I think too fraught Call me postmodern. I think it's too fraught universal is a better word right stron You're listening. I know you are Objective it's too fraught first time And you know, it was very uncomfortable But in a way i'm grateful for it because the ideas that I started to encounter both in classes and also socially at school Those are the ideas that have now swallowed the culture and have swallowed the institutions that are meant to uphold the liberal order ah okay, now let's talk about that for a minute because Why are you so convinced that that's true? Like I mean I what's true? That they swallowed everything. Yes, exactly exactly right because This is a major question. So our culture is faced now. It's important that you know that we have toronto talking to new york here That's not an incidental aspect of this conversation. I don't know where barry weiss is she's in new york or los angeles. Uh, she's not in Baton ruse louise. She's not in baton rouge or you know You know Someplace else in the middle of the united states I'm seeing this stream division or that's what it appears and but the question is is it as serious as it as as you might Perceive it to me or is that a consequence of the information sources that you're availing yourself of and of course this exactly the same thing now you've got the Epistemic crisis because now we're always aware of that. We're aware of our formation. This is part of the reason the secret sacred self Which is people imagine that well deep down inside of me. There's an identity that i'm always aspiring for It's it's it's universal and it's fixed but it's also always malleable and mutable Everything applies to me. I mean I saw this coming as far as i'm concerned, you know Well 20 years ago 25 years ago, but more particularly five years ago And you know that's got me in all sorts of trouble But it seems to me to be something real and something dangerous and i'm trying to put my finger on exactly what it is And to warn people about it But it's not like I don't have my doubts about you know, whether this is just my conspiratorial Idiosyncrasy making itself known in the world. And so I don't think it's a conspiracy. I think the question is whether or not Okay, what do we mean by conspiracy? That there's a group of people somewhere in a back dark room who are plotting this. No, it's It's emergent is what it is The optimists are right and this thing is a moral panic and it will burn itself out I am more on the optimistic thing, but I think we need to talk about it just like you know panic around satanic, you know Interesting illustration Watch jonathan peugeot mild molesters burned them that that burned out in the 1980s in this country and maybe in canada, too I'm not sure. Yes, definitely. Well, we always do things a little less extremely, but we follow along in your wake, right? So the question we appreciate our we appreciate your humble faithful service. It is like are those people right? You know will Wokeness I hate that word, but I don't know what else to call it. Will it recede on its own like a thief? I hate that word. It's emergent, but I don't know what else to call it for that burns itself out or will it only sort of Let's say lose the battle over the culture and over sense making and over the elite institutions in America and more broadly in the west if it meets another force that pushes against it I don't see it receding on its own and the more I look Inside, you know, certainly the press I have the front row seat to witness that and we can talk about it now part of her anxiety is the assumption that These institutions Like the New York Times that are increasingly losing educational authority Now don't get me wrong. I've said many times that I mean, oh youtube is going to replace television. No, it isn't And don't forget youtube is built on google And As much as I know brett weinstein might love to get on to bit shoot or odyssey or Thinkspot or some other platform Nothing's nothing on the horizon challenges youtube right now. There's no question about it same with twitter Oh, we're going to start a new twitter. Uh clubhouse is coming up yada yada yada. So Hard to know let's talk about it. So what education? science Big tech the hr departments of major corporations in this country like it's touching everything Yeah, it is. It's emergent And you know, I got a notification from my university department today They developed a contract for undergraduates who are going to work in labs, which seems to me to be completely unnecessary Anyways, because that was something that was always handled by individual professors But most of it's just you know Care of data and and the sorts of things that you might expect that might be made explicit if you were going to work in A lab, but of course two-thirds of the way in it there's a huge statement about all the groups that you're not allowed to be prejudiced against in your conduct and and so We had this whole problem in psychology that they're only getting data from certain groups This policy might ensure that that Distortion of the psychological data continues because you can't notice anything that might be problematic about a particular group Yeah smart notes and and fair enough. I mean as my in my place in the christian reform church where we deal with some of this I'm fairly buffered And and so forth and so it's just another example of how These ideas these let's call them anti-racist ideas for the time being Our anti-group prejudice ideas are There there's an insistence that they manifest themselves everywhere and you might say well, you know who isn't anti-racist? And so why object to that and my sense is that? well They don't come they're not part. They're not they don't stand on their own. They're part of an entire system of ideas That's the thing that that that's always bothered me is that there's a whole system of ideas here and And and this system of ideas infiltrated the blue church And I think it was pageau with rave kelly and I think he's right In a lot of ways the new atheists There's some responsibility for this. I want to get to the part of this video that i'm thinking about though That would be that inequality of outcome conveniently described for the purposes of justifying justifying the ideology, yeah, let me describe what okay, so what we're going to deal with now is a lot of language because One of the things that When you let's say you're in a seminary education and you're learning greek and hebrew and you're trying to learn exegesis with greek and hebrew Is well, where is the meaning located? It is is it in the words or is it in the sentence or is it in the paragraph paragraph or is it in the book? Or is it in the library? Which is what the bible is and you're you're always dealing with those issues and now again when the this sub strata has shifted and lots of new things are Emerging bubbling up from beneath and and there's no connection with heaven And we get this mess How I like some of the the features of this ideology and you tell me if you agree that inequality of outcome is necessarily a result of systemic Discrimination or systemic bigotry, okay, and that's part of the equity issue Sure, but again, that's another one of these words that's been hijacked. I know that How do you hijack a word Oh you might say oh that's obvious Did you pay attention to the words you were using you hijack an airplane? You hijack a car You hijack a word Oh A whole bunch of mental pictures, huh a whole bunch of stories, huh? That's exactly why I brought it up is because i've been talking to a group of people in in in la who are liberals And on left of me I would say but hey all the difficulty with that word liberal We've been stuck on this issue of equity because i've been insisting for example that it does mean It's a drive towards equality of outcome defined in exactly the manner that you describe and their insistence is no that Did you notice that I used it when I read on in that one night a book? What did they mean by it? I was a bit before all of this So I view that only a minority of the people who are pushing the idea of equity hold Well, the majority of people that go along with you know Equity, okay, but now look at how we're talking a majority of people Anybody do that survey? No, that's that's it's the only way we can do it It's all through my anecdotal experience the little groups that I circulate with Just think I believe in fairness. They're not thinking deeply about this fairness Like when you cut the cake when you were a kid It's like the person that says Black Lives Matter will of course Black Lives Matter but if you look under the hood of what the Organizations that are at the forefront of the Black Lives Matter movement believe well, they believe in you know, abolishing the nuclear family they believe There's an icon right there the nuclear family bang female genital mutilation bang Those are the icons are using those two to evaluate the narratives which come up from the data which themselves filter the data Leave in abolishing or defunding the police. They believe that capitalism more icons Is evil. I mean they believe in all kinds of things But the majority of people that are saying or putting up a sign Black Lives Matter is saying racism's bad the majority of people that are saying and if I do this video on Dealing with what they talked about here. We're gonna have to talk about the definition of racism What do we mean by that word and and to a certain degree when you when you get to the point that you have to start Redefining words, you know, we're in a transition point like Zach sign There's the there's the horizontal transition and then there's the well in some ways you're seeing the heavens from a different place But of course heavens heaven pulls you up And I believe in equity and diversity are saying I believe in the dignity of difference and I believe in fairness and I believe in equality of the dignity of difference Well, that one snuck in fast. What do you mean by that? Opportunity so when the people in these theoretical people in LA when they're saying that is that what they mean or do they mean something else? No, they mean they why think what they mean is that the people who are pushing equity believe in equality of opportunity And they don't see the the the trojan worseness They've exactly right and these are reasonable people and they're not that they're not that happy with political correctness I should also say so there is a reasonable a group as I can communicate But I have to be honest at this point if you can't if one can't see the way that this language has been hijacked and Has been you okay now now she's gonna start talking like missionary if one can't see okay, well What's the seeing? the seeing is And again, we've learned this through AI the seeing is the narrative you see through a narrative So if one doesn't have that narrative of mine You get your icons get your narrative and you get your world you get your data if one can't see Hmm we're we're we're we're drawing lines here And communicate but I have to be honest at this point. I have to be honest It's all these little religious tells we use if you can't if one can't see at this point They're not that happy with political correctness I should also say so there is a group as I can communicate But I have to be honest at this point if you can't if one can't see the way that this language has been hijacked and Has been used as a kind of Trojan horse brilliant. I should say Trojan horse strategy to smuggle in a sort of What exactly are we smuggling Jesus no, it's not Jesus that now also pay attention again if you looked at the look to the previous It was only a half hour. Sorry for the little video. I just you know happens sometimes Notice she almost never looks directly at the camera here that only comes that I haven't checked the whole thing But because once I saw it at the end it was like oh, oh She's very aware of her audience. She's making her appeal. This is the altar call. She's still talking to Jordan at this point Hardened identity, you know zero-sum identity politics view of the world to smuggle in a view of the world in which we either have Collective guilt or collective innocence. There's there's another element of this and again, it's emergence and we're starting to name it I mean, that's that whole process that we've been at for the last few nieces Naming these elements because they've emerged up and said hey, wait a minute This is Douglas Murray does the same this collective guilt and collective innocence and I get me as a reform minister says well I know all about this. We've been talking about this for a long long time Literally based on the circumstances of our birth Literally based on the circumstances of our birth. I don't know how many of that be, you know How many circumstances are you talking about it's smuggle in a you know? Deeply anti-capitalist position that smuggle in essentially You know a leftist illiberalism then I'm sorry you have blinders on I The evidence for this is so overwhelming at this point Speaking as a religious person. I'm really not sure how like if you if you don't want if you don't want to believe it I think it's because the discomfort of believing it outweighs So now you're psychologizing your your social political adversary Pathologizing them. Oh now you're now you're now you're a capitalist-a-phobe You're a capitalist-a-phobe or you're a you're a now you're you're afraid, you know, that's that's part of our bag of tricks I use it too Then let me let me say that again. Yeah, I think it's because she's looking for words There's emergence here. She's looking for emanation That admitting that that's true and that that's what's happening is extremely psychologically scary What's Remarkable here is that this argument has I've even seen this use argument used how many times and how many places we call them? homophobes and transphobes Now racists obviously comes from an earlier age so we didn't get the whole we didn't Psychologize it all there. So So so what what what are the woke afraid of I mean that's that's that's how she's sort of Putting it together here. It's very interesting and it's extremely socially scary if you were a liberal because all of a sudden it means that these institutions and the So so now almost this phobia sort of switches here I might be wrong about this and now it's like now it's our you know, team team IDW Now team IDW is having their phobic moment and now suddenly we realize oh my goodness They've changed all the meanings of the words. Hey, I totally understand that because I you know in many ways I grew up, you know, New York area read the New York Times all those things. So yeah, but oh No, the world is changing under our feet And let's just even say like the social world and the culture that you took for granted As being a certain thing and having certain qualities is no longer what it appears to be And that is the perfect segue to connect it back to the New York Times. Yes. Yes, it is It is the perfect segue but before we get there let's pause for a moment because and I totally understand what she's saying I've told this story before My father Going to synod that's sort of the the bi-national body the that the Christian reform church has every year haven't had it for two years because of kovat, but Someone once leaned over because my father of course was deep into second wave anti-racism and racial reconciliation and all of those things that's that's that's what I grew up in, you know someone leaning over to To my father once at synod who knew the person talking to him knew my father's father my grandfather and said Your father was such a good conservative and that of course was a was was chastising my father for his his His progressive sentiments at least progressive for the 19 Progressives in the frame of the Christian Reformed Church for the 1970s who who thought that? Timothy Christian School should be able to desegregate and allow African-American members of the Chicago Church's in for a Christian education so my my father and mother worked a long time on Christian education for people who couldn't afford it in Patterson, New Jersey and so But I could very much imagine many of many people leaning over to me and Paul your father was such a reliable progressive. What happened to you and And you know I hear and some of what she's saying is I used to be liked You know, although she begins by saying she was the squish at the Wall Street Journal So in that group of people she was liked and then at one place in this video She talks about just how hard it was for her to no longer Beyond the in group just look up CS Lewis's essay on the inner ring and And how and Peterson knows this this is deeply troubling for her Okay, so let's do that that that I agree with you that let's do that now So now you're at the Wall Street Journal and and you're you're starting to write there Yeah, and let's just fast forward that I get to the New York Times and suffice it to say that you know I was never popular. I had already published lots of things. I was known as Being a Zionist. I I was known for for you know views that put me outside of the Let's say the the cool woke kids table. What do you mean by you were never popular? You just you I love when Peterson's a psychologist I love in these conversations Oh, yeah, wait a minute. I'm a clinical psychologist. You just said something that's pretty important And we're not gonna just glaze over that little tidbit lost over that very rapid. Sure That's one of my favorite Petersons Experience there there was a skepticism of me from the beginning but I Mean it was the New York Times. It's the most important journalistic platform in the world It's the church it's the status it's the heavens I had arrived and so I was more than willing to put up with you know getting the cold shoulder from some of my colleagues because the You you can just can't overstate how powerful that distribution system is much Yeah, yeah More so than the Wall Street Journal and it holds a certain Position I would say just not beyond America, you know in position status height remember we started with Zack Stein We're between worlds all she's wound up between worlds in in in the west and and so I Was loathe to give that up and I would be willing and was willing to put up with a lot in order to Cling to that position. Why? And Jordan we're not we're not doing therapy on here, but you know Lots of meat in that meat lots of meat on that bone for a clinical psychologist How do you think people saw you the like because they they they they assumed they made a variety of assumptions about sure That was what was alienating. What is it that you represented or were in their eyes? Do you hear us see? heresy The whole thing is a religious conversation It's heresy someone who but but in this context Those wokesters, they're the religious ones not us. We're in the bright cloud of secularism. We're not religious at all Really? Lived like them went to the same restaurants as them dated like them um, you know by all She's a lesbian. You're supposed to be on our side Metrics should have agreed with them on every tenant of this new orthodoxy But I don't right so you're worse because of that see I just talked to uh trader rima czar Um professor at mount ellison who's who's an arab? immigrant to canada Lebanese and she just got hung out to dry by the pathetic cowards at her university for Not to mince words there chardon or it was her sin She doesn't exactly know But remember these are Secularist people so now we can use this these terms sort of pejoratively but She's looking around for emanation. She really is No, but apparently it was something like incitement to sexual violence and also insistence that canada isn't a systemically racist country And and she wrote some of this in her blog, which she thought was mostly for distribution to her friends. And anyways, uh, She but she's a heretic like you are because she's female and she's an immigrant to canada and so it's incumbent upon her to adopt the Victimized identity that people like her should know is good for them and because she didn't although in quite a minor way She really literally doesn't know what her crime was. She now what's interesting is that again? We have these full inversions where? After the 60s to be Many people branded Heretic as a an emblem of pride. I was kicked out of the church And so of course the church was this is where you get into peugeot's Peugeot's parasitic storytelling. I was I was kicked out I mean steve jobs would proudly call himself a heretic because all this christendom I'm pushing against it. Yada yada yada but now This is a church. They didn't want to get kicked out of this is a church They really believed in in a lot of ways They're not a lot that different from the the deconstructed wokesters in terms of the dynamic that comes She doesn't really know who her accusers were they suspended her without pay. She's a tenured professor It's a worse case than the case in new york with paul rossi. It's much worse. It's quite stunning I mean if you met her you'd think why is it stunning? See again for me. I inhabit a church world where You do heresy You commit certain sins Uh, yeah suspended without pay it ain't suspended you're out And now well wait a minute that's not supposed to happen in our world our world is You didn't think you inhabited a religious structure You didn't think that well, but the religious structure is changing. Oh You're looking for a theological dispute Go back and watch Tom listen to tom how tom holland and dominic sandbrook's culture war Tom holland's definition of a culture war is a war which is fundamentally theological In christendom That's what they're fighting now what you have to do is begin to ask yourself now. Wait a minute What religion were you? Because that is actually the more helpful question now again I'm sort of running out of time right now and so this will be it for video making today I'll post the first one. I I will have posted on Tuesday and i'll likely post this one wednesday morning. It'll be a little longer than the 30 minute one So sorry about that. I know julian that you and your dumpster welders up there in canada get really annoyed when I have a shorty, but The real question to ask underneath all of this is now wait a minute, what was your religion before? Well, we're going to call it classical liberalism Okay, why did it fail? Why did it fail? Why was it so susceptible by being eaten? From the inside That's really how most religions die. They're eaten from the inside and that's why in another way jordan peterson's darwinian darwinian Approach to truth is so powerful because the religions that last Well, there might be something to them There might be something to them And we're gonna have to see what happens to christianity Because it's you know, I know Oh this stuff gets so complicated because that religion of The new york times before its fall in the eyes of barry weiss and jordan peterson I've got some of that religion in me Did I know it was in me? To what degree was it sort of wheat and tears jesus parable just sort of all Interlocked in me and so now with this with this struggle. Well now in a sense I get to pull it apart and take a look at it and say Maybe I need to critique that well against what can I critique it? Well heaven heaven And what's happening in our culture actually is that? The fundamentalist and the rebel wisdom group are are almost on the same page There's a little bit more of that video. I want to play for you Remember we were talking about educational authority I'm gonna ask danny mulhern if you would like to unmute yourself and ask your first question Thanks david hi zach thanks very much for this um Um Yeah, my question is if you had a nine-year-old preparing um All of the fancy words here comes down to action right for secondary education at this time What kind of schooling would you be considering? Uh It would depend on so many factors It would depend on where you live. It would depend on the nature of the nine-year-old. Um Remember my videos about rules and guidelines very guideline guy systemic thinker Broad view, you know You're gonna have this hemmen and hawn. I do it too. I get it. It's it's a function of the culture How much money you have? Uh a whole bunch of things so it's very hard to give general advice um But we're gonna do it anyway You know, yeah In vermont if I have a nine-year-old I don't if I was living in vermont, um, I would likely be uh involved with unschooling and homeschooling networks oh, I thought it was those radicals like esther o'riley that That that that young woman who was homeschooled by those religious conservatives and those fundamentalists There it is there it is Homeschool your kid Wow Wow Wow Yeah. Yeah institutions. They're breaking down It's gonna be a bumpy ride folks
