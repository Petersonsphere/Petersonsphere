 Hi, this is Paul and the rest of the Jordan Peterson Sam Harris Conversations have now been released by Pangburn Jordan Peterson has released the Dublin one on his stream And I suppose he'll release the London one soon. You can find them all on the Pangburn on the Pangburn channel and Now I've listened to I've listened to the Dublin and the London ones not as much as the Vancouver ones But this this last section after they resolve the question-and-answer thing in London I think is quite revelatory in terms of What's happening in this debate and I think I think Douglas Murray makes a good appearance here So I'm going to I don't have a PowerPoint. I'm just gonna run through it and make comments on it as we go So here we go I'll ask you something. Let's go back to the let's go back to the to one of the core problems that so again I think it's helpful when Peterson is kind of driving the train here because he's the one that seems to have a picture of the pro of the a picture of the project and an orderly way of proceeding whereas Sam just kind of keeps flinking around and and Douglas Murray has his own take on this that we've been trying to address which is the the apparent failure perhaps of The the the rationalist atheist types to develop a an active ethos that has sufficient beauty and motivational power to Serve as a credible replacement for the religious rituals So there seems to there must be a reason why that's that failure has occurred Now this this point is an important one and see here right away. I say I'm going to I Didn't do a PowerPoint now. I miss it Stir Why psychology silent when it comes to atheism I played I played this one before and Doing this work and and and this is a this is a video where she she goes into it and talks about well-being and the issues with the the atheism and she herself is an atheist she's a Don't know exactly how she categorized categorizes herself. She's a she's university professor gender LGBT non-binary something something of this nature and so she ends her little presentation with once again an admonition a little bit of sermonizing about how How on earth the atheists can organize themselves how on earth the eighth and it atheists can establish Communities how on earth the atheists can establish their own congregations Please please please she begs can we please organize ourselves and Jordan Peterson's point here is this has failed and There've there've been a number of attempts perhaps the most successful attempt at it has been in some mainline denominations that have attempted to you can find if you search a Dutch atheist minister you can find a Pastor in the and the in the Protestant Church of the Netherlands who claims to be an atheist recently there was a a woman who was a minister in the Canadian mainline Denomination who was kicked out because of her atheism and that was just a bridge too far and that kind of goes to Reinforce some of the points that Sam Sam Harris was making but you know, so this is Jordan Peterson's question He's saying okay Sam you want this pure rationality Why hasn't your project worked? It's been around a fairly long time Why can't the atheists get together and establish their own communities and really do this thing upright? Right. So yeah Short list of reasons one is that Traditionally the impulse to do that in a religious context has been fatal Right so to declare your apostasy has been the almost as reliable a way of committing suicide as jumping off a building in most cultures and most Societies for the longest time and still is in many places as you know in the Muslim world so so he's saying well in the Muslim world it hasn't happened, but We've had religious freedom in the West for a very long time and and while This Canadian pastor did lose her job for declaring herself an atheist and that was that was even too far for the United Church of Canada You know so Sam has a point but I don't think it fully addresses the whole question that Peterson is asking there's been a barrier to entry to thinking creatively about alternatives to religion and so much of atheism and secularism is just a a a pitched battle against the The eroding power of religion and when religion really has its power right we know what it's like I mean that you know they again well I think what we spoke about this at one point you know that just that the moment that it makes this most salient is You know Galileo being shown the instruments of torture by men who wouldn't look through his telescope I would encourage people to take a deeper look a higher resolution look at the Galileo incident Oh, right. I mean that's that was the point of contact between untrammeled human rationality and The womb that bore it right? the religious Because Galileo was really being There there were a number of political issues involved and also Galileo was being criticized for Chucking out Aristotle not the Bible at the beauty of the heavens right so the moment What a person like Galileo stepped a little too far and to connect us to astrology again Galileo was a court astrologer right? They were there was a con there was a point of contact between astronomy and astrology at that point so We're still under the shadow of that kind of dogmatism and oppression in much of the world Depression in much of the world I mean for the longest time I mean it's still in the United States you cannot run for the presidency without pretending to believe in God It's amazing which is a really interesting point because we've got we've had a good number of presidents who were not not not churchgoing people and we've had a lot of presidents probably most of the presidents for the for the 20th century have been nominal ish Christians You know even even some of those most recently and of course the the point with astrology And the presidency is interesting giving the incidence of the Reagan's in the White House and Nancy Reagan's pension for astrology Amazing fact right when will that change if someday it will but we have we have just had I Don't know that it will because because of all of the reasons that Peterson keeps pointing out at almost no time Experiment in this space and innovative sometime. I've been some decades I suppose the thing that unites Sam unites Jordan to me on this is if if we face some of the Problems some of the enemies might even say that you identify as well And the question is whether you should face them in the midst of an experiment that may or may not work I a leap into pure rationality Or whether you might decide it's worth among other things taking some of the versions Of things that you've had that have been of worth in your past and using them where they're useful But what are you picturing there because there really is no leap. There's no global leap to pure rationality There's just there's this incremental erosion of religious answers to Terrestrial questions so there's the I get the moment you you have a science of neurology Here's the subtraction story as Charles Taylor calls it you begin to look at epilepsy not as demonic Possession but as a neurological problem before there's a science of neurology You know it makes it a little difficult to answer how? exorcist exorcism continued Because of its effectiveness against neurological problems however, but what the hell is happening right so into that something obviously drove Douglas I would say in some sense surprisingly to make the assumption that one of the things that we need to do to Defend whatever it is that we have of value in the West assuming that we have anything of value was something like the incorporation of this Religious substructure so like it's not something that I would have expected you to conclude But what do you why did you conclude it well? partly for the reason I just suggested That the leap into pure rationality There's no evidence yet that it's going to work or it's gonna be enough or enough people are going to be able to partake But give me the precise small place where you're worried that it's gonna fail and what can you what are you imagining? What you think it's failing now Yeah, let me give you one example. Yeah, and we we may be in the midst of the discovery that the only thing Worse than religion is its absence And where where are we discovering that look at the religions that people are making up as we speak I mean every day there's a new dogma and you and I and Jordan have repeatedly tripped over those dogmas some they usually survived it has to be said but This They're stampeding to create new religion all the time at the moment every every new heresy that's invented And they're not as well thought through as past terraces They don't always have the bloody repercussions yet, but you can easily foresee a situation in which they do I mean a new religion is being created as we speak by a new generation of people who think they are non Ideological who think they're very rational who think they're past myth who think their past story who think they're better than anything They've never bothered to study their ancestors Can't you say that dogmatism is the problem the generic problem here is dogmatism We've got firm belief now in a sense Sam goes all the way back if you go to the beginning of Vancouver one when Peterson and Harris or Peterson and Weinstein Basically backed Sam as to saying okay it's not necessarily religious dogmatism, but it's dogmatism per se and unwillingness to change a particular fact or change a particular Conviction and and what's interesting here is that ham Sam is about as dogmatic as you can get on this one point He keeps coming back to it in the absence of good argument and good evidence and Absolutely, we can agree that dogmatism of any kind And to end to think about my conversation with Adam. Adam is a huge Jonathan Jonathan height fan Jonathan's Jonathan Heights point is that These things bind and blind and and this in a sense Sam Harris keeps wanting to pull out the imagined objectivity of This free space where facts are always purely discerned by objective individuals Where in the space in Sam's head? Well, everything is crystal clear because it's the space in Sam's head and this isn't some This isn't some arena of pure rationality where no one has biases Which leads one to believe that Sam can't see his own biases That The test of a space Would be in the test of rationality would be whether others can actually follow your trail And again, you have the problem of all of these trails start someplace and everyone's starting from a different place As that danger will always have that danger But the void also has a danger The void also has a danger the void that you can create if you throw out all the stories that help get you to where you are also has this danger because people come up with these new stories and Every day's news now is about this every our politics is now basically about this I mean well, yeah and what and what's flown in to fill the gap seems to be something like a new tribalism Absolutely, which is exactly what you'd expect in some sense, right? If you if you demolish the superordinate system, you know religion divides people no doubt, but it also unites people Yes, Jonathan height. So one of the things that Arguably unites people above their mere tribalism is their union in an abstract religious superstructure And then this is the whole point of the book of acts where suddenly in antioch you had Multiple ethnicities now this ancient city of antioch had walls not only around the city But within the city to keep the separate ethnic groups apart and the assumption in the ancient world was that Your religion is a function of your ethnicity So you had jewish religion you had Babylonian religion you had a syrian religion and there were some commonalities between them that helped the groups kind of understand each other and then polytheism was the means by which hopefully Different groups could in fact not kill each other over religion But what happened in christianity was that this got broken? And now and you find this again and again mentioned in the new testament where slaves are free Gentiles and and jews Scythians You know all manner of barbarians now our brothers and sisters read the book of philemon where that is a where that is Applied to the question of slavery in the new testament This is this is one of the key things that christianity Did in the roman empire now the roman empire was bound together? By the worship of the emperor but within a polytheistic context the worship of the empire was kind of like paying your taxes Or pledging allegiance to the flag you could maintain your emperor worship and maintain all of your other deities maintain your your local Ethnic deity maintain your civic deity maintain the the imperial cult and by having polytheism You could have all of these together what happens in christianity is that this as paul says the barrier that causes hostility Is broken down and now the traditional ways in the ancient world of enmity between people becomes resolved via Union in christ and that is one of the major Advances that christianity offered to the ancient world and the point that peterson is making is that once you take that away people are now simply reverting back to The ways that they separated each other before christianity And if you demolish that well, then one of the things that does seem to happen is the emergence of a reflexive tribalism Because people need a need a group identity of sorts And the easiest thing to do seems to be to revert to ethnicity and race and gender and sex, etc Etc And then we do end up and have ended up in this situation that douglas outlines and you know one of the things I think That distinguishes us temperamentally possibly Maybe because you're a little more on the liberal side and i'm a little more on the conservative side even temperamentally speaking is that your fundamental terror is that of fundamentalism although you also state in the moral landscape that You understand that the perils of nihilism and I would say my fundamental terror is that of nihilism Even though i'm susceptible sensitive to the catastrophes of fundamentalism, but I don't think you do address the problem of the void sufficiently Because I don't think that you have anything to offer except Now the void now pay attention the void is going to come up a number of times in this conversation The void is this space that once religion recedes What do people fill it with now again g take gk chesterton? Was stated to have said, you know, it isn't that when people stop believing they will they believe in nothing They'll believe in anything and that may or may not be from gk chesterton, but that's the void that they're talking about here And it's and i'm not trying to minimize your offering you you make a case that people should work to Alleviate suffering and that we should live in truth, but jesus sam you can summarize that in two sentences It doesn't have the potency of of the of the fictional Literary artistic substructure that seems necessary to make that into something that's that's a compelling story And they've dealt with this in a number of the past points where peterson has been making the points that as a delivery system that actually motivates people religion and story is powerful and sam's project is Underwhelming and the evidence talking about evidence here the evidence for the underwhelming power of this is in fact its inability to take off over the last hundred and some odd years that it has had a A great degree of power in the west And and sam and so both jordan peterson and douglas murray are making the point that sam Your project has failed it has never really gone anywhere And again, we could go back to melanie bruster and the the constant admonition to okay atheists Let's get our act together and and what peterson as a clinical psychologist is basically saying this isn't how people work You're not going to undo The formation of human beings that has been around thousands if not millions of years Well, so this is where we might disagree. This could be a fundamental disagreement. Uh, yeah I don't see the problem of nihilism the way you do or the way it's advertised like once you rip out the false certainties and the bad evidence and the bad arguments and the and the the mere dogma is imposed on us by prior generations that hole Never right there There sam harris just right there closes Safely with anything else you have to put something in it. So in other words It's there's there's no void in me. There's no hole in me It's it's closed completely. I'm just fine. But a little bit from now. We're going to hear about well There's been some smuggling going on sam Place that's shaped just like that some other false certainty or some other story And I simply don't think that's the case. I think there's so many things we outgrow both. Okay, but What douglas murray and jordan peterson are offering sam harris here is evidence And evidence is supposed to be what sam harris is all about And what he's essentially doing is sticking to his dogma individually, you know in our own childhoods and Culturally that where there is no there is no void left There's no santa claus shaped void that we have to fill with the exact same thing experience But people certainly experience some people people i'm not discounting the fact that it is hard to be happy in this world I mean we are living in a world That seems designed perfectly designed to frustrate our efforts now that business about hard to be happy is interesting because again The assumption the assertion of sam harrison his project is that you don't need god to be happy You don't need god to have meaning you don't need god to to this is god number one now to finish off all of the Problems of the world, you don't need god to do that Rationality is sufficient and now implicit in this is that the tools of the world are sufficient and and this is where I think the the affluent western assumption beneath sam harris becomes obvious that Well, this is lovely sam if you're healthy wealthy dare, I say privileged and Life within this context is going great. What if you're not as good-looking as sam You're not as smart as sam you're not as healthy as sam you weren't born in the right place in the right time as sam is Now sam is saying Buck up. Sorry. No religion for you I don't know why you can't just be happy with the cars and the technology and the internet and all of these things But but sam also is a sort of a moralist and okay well stay away from porn and you know And and if you really get if you really get scared in the middle of the night You know by no means should you pray to jesus because you're just going to make things worse And peterson is a clinical psychologist and he deals with people in their pain He deals with people who are and and listen to jordan peterson's lectures the kinds of patients that he's had before He was famous who they've got low iq they've got Um They've got agoraphobia they've got I mean if you're a clinical Psychologist you are going to see the painful edge of humanity and if you look at scott adams I've i've used this in previous videos. I mean how much pain out there is there? Maybe I can pause it and find it. This is what happened when I don't do a powerpoint Not scott adams scott alexander um his uh a wonderful post december 24 2015 how bad are things slate star codex? One advantage of working in psychiatry is getting a window into the otherwise invisible world of really miserable people It's the same thing as being a pastor I work in a wealthy mostly white college town consistently ranked one of the best places to live in the country This is the kind of place sam harris would say his project has succeeded to a great degree If there's anywhere that you might dare to hope wasn't filled to the brim and again scott alexander is an atheist um One of the places filled to the brim with people living um It wasn't filled to the brim with people living hopeless lives. It would be here But that hope is not realized every day I get to listen to people describing problems that would seem overwrought if they were in a novel and made up if this was a think piece of fragmentation of american society a perfectly average patient will be a 70 year old woman who used to live Somewhere else but moved here a few years ago after her husband died in order to be closer to family She has some medical condition or other that prevents her from driving or walking around much and the family she wanted to be closer to Have their own issues. So she has no friends within 500 miles and never leaves her house except to go to the doctor's appointments She has one son who is in jail one daughter who's married to a drug addict She had one grandchild her only remaining joy in the world But her but her drug addict son-in-law uses access to him as a bargaining chip to make her give him money From her rapidly dewinning retirement account so he can buy drugs When she can't cough up enough quickly enough he bans her from visiting or talking to the grandchild Plus he tells the grandchild. It's her fault Her retirement savings are rapidly running out. She has no idea what she will do when they're gone Probably end up on the street. Also. Her dog just died. Okay, sam. There's no religion in this story Okay, none of this can really be attributed to this Supernatural being that you're so terribly afraid of but this is normal and Scott alexander is writing from a an affluent one of the wealthiest places Best places to live in all of human history and it is insufficient Now Do you have a hard time figuring out why people become religious? Why people make up their own religions and then he goes into another one? And then he does a little does a little survey One percent of people are in prison two percent of people are on probation one percent of people in a nursing home two percent with dementia 20 with chronic pain seven percent with depression two percent have cognitively Disabled one percent of schizophrenia 20 on food stamps one percent are wheelchair bound seven percent alcoholic Nowhere on this list is anyone suffering from a religious condition? They are all suffering from the kinds of conditions that are normal to life in this world That is the challenge sam. Is it any wonder why people get religious? So then he runs the script that he talks about out of every any 20 people chronic pain alcoholic chronic pain. No problems, but bear in mind They see plenty of these people with no problems because their problems are their son-in-law is an alcoholic or They're bitter against what's happened to their mother or this is what Psychologists deal with all the time and they sit in a room and deal with people all the time And this is the same thing that pastors deal with because you see someone on the street and they look fine They have income they have food they have housing all of this stuff is set They might even be wealthy And if you listen to them and you open the door just a little bit To to give them an invitation to complain Whoosh in it comes This is why I have too many tabs open And permanent happiness so you asked me you put me on the spot a while back Let me just let me just add my answer. This. I just think that there's the recipe for a good life or at least A Minimal recipe for a good life. It's not that this is all that's entailed But this is this is this is certainly necessary if not sufficient is to live a life that is Increasingly motivated by love Ah Where's this coming from and guided by reason this has okay now In terms of my marching through the vancouver lectures, it's right at this point that I was going to pause and say okay sam Well, let's hear it again, this is sam's used to be well-being so when you listen to vancouver it was well-being well-being well-being Okay. Well now we're getting a little bit more definition Increasingly motive is to live a life That this is certainly necessary if not sufficient is to live a life that is Increasingly motivated by love and guided by reason There's sam's religion he thinks Right, you can't go very far wrong if you are motivated by love and guided by reason motivated by love guided by reason Okay, is this natural? Or is this supernatural? And the problem is is that Well, let's clap jordan's gonna have something to say to this, okay Well, the first thing I would say about that is to me. That's a rip recapitulation of the judaic christian ethic Which is that you should that is to me. That's a rip recapitulation of the judaic christian ethic Now what's interesting if you listen to these things sam anytime Sam has a very selective filter on what is attributed Attributable to the past he gets really salty if you start talking about communists No, no, no, no, no, you can't put that lay that at the door of atheism but then he lays communism at the door of augustin and it's like Sam have you ever read any augustin? Do you know what augustin had to say about love and biblical interpretation and the law? Sam do you understand so so anything bad? Is attributable to a religion? anything good is attributable to reason That sam harris Which is that you should be guided by love and use logo of the first thing I would say about that is to me That's a rip recapitulation of the judaic christian ethic, which is that you should be guided by love And use logos to serve that you gotta read the fine print on reason. No Well, I didn't say reason I said logos because that's the that's something that's deeper there's there's the jesus smuggling Yes, exactly. Well, yes. Yes, definitely. Okay, so but but so look i've been i've been trying to Part of the reason that i'm doing now we're going to get jordan peterson's sermon What i'm doing is to try to address the void Let's say and I now pair in mind jordan peterson. What void is he talking about? This is again if Jordan peterson's life project is maps of meaning his Mission is to address the void Is it a miss is it a mistake that? He's a clinical psychologist and he sits And listens to the void in people's lives. And so on one hand as a clinical psychologist now Remember he was a clinical psychologist. He was a lecturer and he was doing experimental work, but he and that and that In his role as a clinical psychologist He's sitting and listening to the void all the time and he listens and listens and listens and listens at the same time He's he's looked he's in mythology He's trying to trying to work through this world and and that drives him into and remember he In a little bit of christian formation in his youth in a mainline cold war canadian church, but He's he abandons that he still doesn't go to church He drives all the way down and he how can I fill the void because every time I sit with a patient in my room I hear the void And well, what is jordan peterson doing right now on a large scale? He's filling the void. Why is he traveling around every night in a new town in another Venue two or three thousand people to ramble at He's filling the void. This is what jordan peterson is doing I suspect that many of you are actually here because you would like to have the void addressed And so the way it looks to you can hear morpheus in the matrix talking about this Me is something like this and this is what i've derived in part from my studies of religious tradition So I could say that at the beginning of genesis, for example, there's a proposition that It's truthful speech that generates habitable order from chaotic potential That seems to me to be the fundamental narrative and I do believe there's something Dead accurate and real about that because we do Generate the world as a consequence of our communicative effort and then there's a second proposition which is that the world that we generate from the the chaos of potential Is habitable to the degree that the communication that we engage in is truthful And that's why god who uses the logos at the beginning of time to generate the world And and what's about what he's doing here is he's putting his whole thing into a nutshell Is able to say that his creation is good The proposition is the world you bring into being through truthful speech is good And that's the image of god that's implanted in man and woman And there's a grandeur about that idea and you think well you don't need the grandeur because it's just a fiction It's like just wait a second here It's not just a fiction unless you don't believe that in some manner you partake in the creation of the world and that you have An ultimate responsibility that might well be described as divine to participate in that process properly Truthfully and with love and there's every reason to think that that's an elevated ideal so high that it's worthy of Conceptualizing as divine and also to presume that it represents some fundamental metaphysical reality And that's a lot more powerful than you need to be good. Yes Right there. That's he spoke his heart. He preached a sermon as as his Former friend and colleague bernie said when he he jordan peterson was out looking for a church he could buy in toronto This is the sermon jordan peterson wants to preach listen to his voice listen to his passion He is speaking his core here. This is who he is This is the meaning of life. This is how to save the world That in some manner you partake in the creation of the world and that you have an ultimate responsibility that might well be described as divine to participate in that process properly Truthfully and with love and there's every reason to think that that's an elevated ideal so high that it's worthy of Conceptualizing as divine and also to presume that it represents some fundamental metaphysical reality The only problem with it is his sermon is You need almost a phd to understand his sermon, but this is his heart and Same as unmoved and that's a lot more powerful than you need to be good Yes, but that the problem and and when he says it's a lot more powerful than you need to be good. You can hear him critiquing You you hear him you almost he's almost channeling the 12 year old In the main line united church at canada in northern alberta Hearing the message. What did he get out of church? You need to be good Good What do we find now now this the social justice thing is Is making its way it's become the new civil religion in north america and it's making its way through the churches And when I listen to social justice sermons, what do the sermons all boil down to? You need to be good Okay but What they don't understand is that Christianity answers the question I need to be good. What if i'm not what if I can't what if I am the auschwitz guard? What if that happened to me? What if that's me? read Corrie ten booms the hiding place get to the end of the book where she is She was a christian. She hid jews because she was a christian And she went to the same prison camps of the jews because she hid them because she was a christian and she's Reliving the christian story she goes into the underworld and her sister dies in the concentration camp and she comes out of it And she's bearing the scars of the death of her sister But then she goes on the road to tell her story And when she goes to germany to preach A guard comes up to her a former guard a former guard that was in her camp a former guard that she knows Is directly responsible for the death of his sister and he has the nerve to come up to her after the message and to say I feel so liberated by the love of jesus. Thank you for preaching And corrie ten boom now has a crisis Because talking about the love of jesus has been easy But now she has to What is she going to say to this prison card who killed her sister? Read the passage get the book read the book read the passage They're looking for a way to motivate people basically Basically Read the passage Is that I I could do exactly what you just did with buddhism Or hinduism and it is just as grand And just as deep What does sam think jordan just did? I'd really love to know that Because Now he's saying you could do this exact same thing with hinduism and buddhism. He's saying okay. All religions are the same That's what he keeps saying. They're all the same Nan amenity is going to say Hinduism and buddhism are totally different And just as anchored to the the first person experience of Contemplatives who've taken that as far as they could take it, you know Well, then I would say sam you should do that and see how people respond to it Well, no, no, no because I yes seriously no no because and jordan peterson saying okay If you can do what i'm doing and helping people fill the hole fill it Please because there's more void that needs to be filled and sam's no no I see the end of the end of the game. It's not it doesn't arrive where I want to get to where we need to get to because it is it's It would be to different effect It's to it there are different claims ultimately about the status of truth and good and evil and about the beginning of the world and the fate of a human Consciousness after death it's complete. They're completely Irreconcilable worldviews you but I also do not swear if there are hindus in the audience. They believe something that is totally irreconcilable To what christians believe I don't think that you can offer Pardon me a watered down version of buddhism as a consequence of psychedelic experience as a as a Acceptable and credible alternative to the power of the fundamental founding myths of the western culture And if you think you can then you should try. Well, no, no, I'm trying. Well, i'm not trying that but that's that's not That's my favorite point in the whole video and again if you're listening on the podcast You might want to see the video we're at minute 129 50 where where peterson gives this little Fascinating little head shake. I'll i'll bring it back. Not what I do. I'm founding myths of the western culture And if you think you can then you should try. Well, no, no, I'm trying. Well, i'm not trying that but that's that's not It's not just the psychedelic experience I know I know and i'm also not making light of the psychedelic experience Listen to take this We're having most of this conversation on the side of Where wherein it seems reasonable to worry about the fate of civilization, right? You we could have started at a very different point with just the nature of consciousness I don't think sam has anything here to go on at all. He's an individualist and and this will become I think Most exposed when a little bit later he starts having to try to talk about love with being itself, right? You wake we all of us wake up each morning We we we are thrust from a condition of deep sleep, which we have to do Each morning we we we are thrust from a condition of deep sleep Which we seem to know nothing about and we're just gonna push through a veil of dreams into this apparently solid reality that we call the world and we're engaging one another in this space of Of just consciousness and its contents and we're trying to make sense of it and science is The best language game we play I would argue The funny thing about harris is that I never know which harris shows up because sometimes it's the fact fact fact And then sometimes it's the oh, it's consciousness trying to make truly rigorous sense of it But it doesn't exhaust all the language games we play we play others that are are also fact-based We talk about what happened historically before we arrived here. We talk about Uh Facts as we can understand them that we just didn't witness but others did and we call that journalism, right? So we're trying to have a fact-based discussion about journalism. Yes. Yes It's getting harder and harder to discern what's actually going on now, but we are we are thrust into this condition of being our apparent selves moment by moment and We notice the difference between happiness and suffering, right? And This is not merely sensory. It's not merely that you know, I don't like the the feeling of a hot stove and I do like a warm bath it's ideas the ways of thinking about ourselves and the world can can Open the door or close the door to various states of happiness and suffering and religion comes into religion Leverages that people the difference between believing that your dead child Is in heaven with jesus And not being able to believe that is enormous okay keep this in mind when we start talking about love because I don't know I does sam harris know people does he work with people does he sit with people when they're in pain? Pastors do this clinical psychologists do this and and what you learn as a pastor clinical Psychologist is that on one hand your motivation is to help people feel better But on the other hand, you know that if you do this in a fast in a facile in a cheap in a shallow in an insufficient way You're not helping them. You need something deep. You need something true Sometimes you need to tell someone something that they don't want to hear But you need to be able to bank on the fact that maybe five ten fifteen years from now They will think back and say it was my own delusion that kept me from knowing it Right I want to ask a specific though You've expended a certain amount of reputational energy and much more on the jihadists in your Battles we say there how much? allyship to use a Very vogue ish term have you found from fellow secular? Rational people who want to love and reason like you now I've listened to this question a few times now because i've listened to this video about four times this morning because Trying to get my head around it This is an interesting question. Basically, he's asking the question about How Okay, so Sam you're over here sort of on you're on the left politically You're on the left in terms of giving it up and being hostile towards christianity A lot of those other people on the left Soft sell islam and they don't want to criticize islam and they want their intersectionality to embrace islam And the thing about sam has been that sam has been strident about My anti my anti religion is going to include islam. I don't know if it's going to include hinduism and buddhism but at least sam's stalwartly consistently against at least the abrahamic religions because that's where he sees issues about having a An inspired text and again this question about the inspired text is something I really want to get into because I really Whereas sam's critique Sam's critique affects certain groups definitely muslims definitely mormons Mormonism is a little bit different because father view prophecy certain christian groups I don't know that he's fair to the broadest christian Traditions that include my own that include roman catholics that include orthodox I I think he basically straw mends them with his take on the bible, but So here basically Doug doug murray is saying okay sam you've you've been you've been out there preaching your your anti-religious gospel And you've had a strident critique against islam Why hasn't the left rallied around you people who are atheists? Why haven't they rallied around you to support you in your condemnation of islam as they all are in their Criticism of christianity in their own culture Well, that is a leading question isn't it i've got fingers if you need more yeah I know you your fingers are safe No, unfortunately, but it's but this is a problem of I wouldn't ascribe this to well The allies you can easily find among deeply religious christians say Are there for the wrong reasons? Okay is now again pay attention to where what this conversation is now These conversations are nested because we're going to get back to the big one. But here in this douglas says why aren't there more people on the left who have given up christianity are secularists are in the political left who hate donald trump and if you listen to Um sam harris, he makes no mistake how he feels about donald trump Why aren't there more people with you criticizing islam? And sam harris is saying well, there are actually a lot of religious people the kind of people i'm pushing against Who in some strange ways are allies with me in this but they're allies with me for the wrong reasons Right, I mean I so I can find you know, I I can well not sure me not all of them. Well, no, no They're there for the wrong. Well, they they see the problem clearly For the wrong reasons. So for instance, so I meet secular Scientist types, you know anthropologists say who? Are so far from knowing what it's like to believe in revelation That they don't believe anyone else does right? So when you tell them that members of isis really believe That if you die in the right circumstances you get 72 versions and you're you're you're you're you're you know Surrounded by rivers of milk and honey and all the rest If you go into the ivory tower, you meet people who don't believe that anyone believes that stuff But if you go into a megachurch, they know people believe that stuff because they believe their own dogmas Right. So in other words many on the left are simply dismissive of religion and see it as juvenile now now this is interesting because part of The career atheists the celebrity atheists part of their critique is always religion is juvenile Well, okay. So is it a is it juvenile and a monster? Monster or is it just juvenile? Right. That's That's what it's like to be to be effortlessly right for not especially good reasons The fact that you believe a book the fact that you believe a book was written by god And therefore it's trivially easy for you to understand that someone else believes that but they just have the wrong book That's not the rational basis for understanding our circumstances that we're looking for I'm not saying whether one is right and one is wrong, but one seems to have more commitment In that and in one battle you're fighting commitment may be important. Yeah. So in other words the christians that are You know the people The christians that look at islam as a serious problem Are committed now this gets then into the larger question that jordan peterson started with about Why can't the atheists build cohesive? Why can't they really be build a cohesive powerful tribe like we've seen religious people do and again if you If you listen to jonathan height jonathan height will say what do you need in order to? Build a tribe. Well, you need that pole to circle around and jonathan height Has that in the um and his criticism of of of the rationalists you need You need poetry you need stories you need iconography You need mythos you need people need mythos in order to tribe up to meet a threat And douglas murray is saying okay sam And remember this is a nested conversation. Okay, sam You're trying to fight this battle against isis and islam and we know you're out there making all kinds of noise about that and you've got all these Inconvenient allies who are on the same page as you but they are Exactly the kind of people that you are dismissing and saying are the problem of the world in other words you You're not falling well into the tribes and that's why you don't need to borrow any of douglas murray's fingers to count your allies and underneath this Underneath the point that douglas murray is making remember i'm a preacher. This is what I do for a living I explain things I explain the bible so I listen and then I read and I try to explain things so that You know slow things down so that we can understand douglas murray is saying sam your position Has a real problem and that and we have plenty of evidence to that problem and it's the same point that melanie bruster is making that your As you keep saying atheism is nothing but the absence of religion It's hard to build a tribe in a vacuum Everyone suffocates and so what people i've told the story. I think a couple of times People will grab whatever totem whatever idle john calvin says our height our hearts are idle factories And this is the point that murray has been making if you take out a big powerful mythos You leave a void and that void has ramifications all the way down in a person's life and many of those people who are Leaving the sam harris tribe and wandering over to the jordan peterson tribe are doing so because That void has remained in their heart and now they are asking and they are coming to me and they are saying paul vanderclaik Can you help me fill the void and I say yeah, I can show you jesus but they say yeah, but i'm not ready for jesus and I say You're gonna have you're gonna have to take the leap You're you're if you're gonna fill the void And they say well, i'm scared and I don't want to lose my rationality. I say, okay I don't believe jesus is calling you to check your brain at the door and and that's part of the reason I make these videos because Whereas yeah, you read the comment section though. Plenty of people will comment on me I don't want you to leave your brain at the door. I want you to bring your brain I believe god gave you a brain to use it for a reason But but the void has to be filled and and what douglas murray is pointing out sam You're you're kind of alone Sam and now sam has a following and so on and so forth, but Many people fill the void And many people have problems Yeah, indeed. There may be many reasons why the people who Deeply want to love and be rational Are absolutely no damn use in that fight because they want to preserve their happiness a bit longer preserve their comfort a bit longer cannot understand the people who genuinely come from a fundamentalist standpoint, yeah, and And what murray is saying here? Okay sam you want to be about well-being? Those who are individually idiosyncratically Solely committed to their own well-being of their conscious self in this moment are no good in a fight What does that mean? They don't survive. What does that mean? It might very well be that atheism Is in terms of a tribe a terminal disease Which is why you don't find very many throughout history and and sam harris keeps wanting to say well, we've overcome that we've gotten beyond it well No one told darwin Because it may very well be well look at the west. We don't have as many children We don't as many convictions and what douglas murray Much more in terms of being in europe on the fringe of this In as opposed to us in north america that you know all our immigrants coming up from the south are Christians for the most part they're catholics. They're roman catholics They're not dealing with islam and doug murray is looking at this and saying europe has to mobilize and deal with this But atheism doesn't give them anything to mobilize around And maybe i'll have a conversation with roland about this or someone else from the netherlands because this is a big issue in the netherlands This is a big issue in europe and and a lot of people say Europe is going to go Is going to become islamic And and the irony is that doug murray is telling sam harris You're trying to find you're trying to fight this brand of islamic fundamentalism And your allies Are not your allies because they're in mega churches singing love songs to jesus and in the meantime the people that are on your side their house is being ransacked and What if england becomes islamist and and sam whereas nice christians like paul vanderklay are paying attention to you A lot of radical muslims will treat you in a wholly different way why? Well, maybe it's because The one that we believe rose from the dead Commanded us to love our enemies and so what that means is I have to love sam harris And maybe what that means is i'm going to have to ask for some forgiveness for some of the things i've said in these videos About sam harris because it's really hard to on one hand be honest and clear but on the other hand to be loving There's christianity Love is not easy. We're going to get back to love in this conversation And there's also other well there to steel man their case for a moment it is understandable to be sensitive to and guilty about the history of colonialism And the the reality of racism And to be so committed he's steel manning the left here, by the way He's not steel manning the uh the big box christianity to tolerance as your master Virtue that you're tempted to tolerate Intolerance and not recognize it to be cowardice which in fact it is making tolerance Your core value is much different than making truth your core value Yeah, which is an interesting thing because and perhaps this is one of the places where you and the Fundamentalist radical leftists. Let's say differ is that the core value that's emerging there is definitely one of tolerance Whereas the core value that you espouse is one of truth and truth and tolerance are not the same thing So it might also yeah Amen he says truth and the belief that as a result truth can be found That it's not a single thing on its own. You just pursue it as a hobby It's just something you do but that you believe that at the end of it. There is a truth to be found So here you have How we're going to categorize peterson there's huge question how to categorize douglas murray I know a lot less about him. So in that sense, it's easier. Is he post christian? but what he's not giving up is the mission for truth and Yeah, you know so but so but douglas what what do you fear Is the case here if if there were more people like me? Uh in the west Right. Well, maybe i'm that maybe i'm the i'm the outlier here. I'm I i'm somehow infected by this overweening commitment to truth and Rationality and science and yet i'm still motivated to worry about jihad Uh, but you're you're worried that there are many people like me who are oblivious to the problem Are you worried about it when so many other people who are hypothetically this is a question you asked Why are you so worried about when there's so many people who are hypothetically like you that don't seem to be worried about it? I mean, maybe you're wrong. You're not you shouldn't be worried about it. Yes, one of this is obviously worried One answer is a possibility. It's my worry at any rate That we may be living in an era when we are discovering that the enlightenment and the enlightenment's values Never went very wide and didn't go terribly deep and This is a very painful realization to make But not only do we go all around the world and discover that we find that at home But the roots turn out not to have gone very deep in even this society and that's a problem He in other words, he's saying enlightenment the enlightenment as a religion Wasn't viral enough and the fear is to Piggyback on this. This isn't what he's saying. But the fear is and and I think this is exactly Jordan peterson's critique of sam harris The enlightenment doesn't have the mythos To go viral and to get into people's emotional souls and what that means is that A well-formed and jordan peterson speak a well-formed religion as opposed to a an ideology is a much better rounded thing and over time What well-formed religions have demonstrated the capacity to is to implant itself in the spectrum of human? temperance temperaments The spectrum of human personalities. So in other words in a well-formed religion You can have the stuff that that makes your heart sing and you can have the stuff that feeds your head and you can have Well, and to me this gets to the again jordan peterson talks about in terms of a multi-factor analysis Which is what he did in the sacramento meeting when he talked about the resurrection I I did tape it in my in my cell phone and i'm tempted to play it. I you know I don't know peterson isn't releasing recordings of these things, but he did say it publicly. So I don't know how I feel about that but Again, this is why I believe in the This is why I believe in the literal bodily resurrection of jesus christ Because that which is most true has to be most true at every level and has to become Instantiated at every level in other words for jesus resurrection not to have been bodily leaves The christian religion Out to lunch. I don't think you can just skim the cream off the top and say No, i'm gonna take a bunch of these things from christianity, but no because if it's if if christianity is true True enough that I can sit down and talk to someone grieving the loss of a loved one And say you will see them again. You won't just talk to them. You don't just feel them in their spirit They don't just live in your heart. You will touch their flesh Is that what our hearts long for Isn't this what we desire? But now we have the challenge. Well, how can I believe that? How can I live into this world? Well, you know what it takes worship. It takes commitment. It takes Donating your money. It takes donating your time It takes all the things that young people understand when they go to the star wars movie and they dress up like their favorite character It means they're going to be able to do it It means living into the fandom. It means committing your life to it if you want to believe it But then you say well, well, what if I go down a rabbit trail and start believing a wrong thing? And I would say that's a real concern but What other choice do you have and this again is where we saved by grace through faith This is where we say, okay lord, I don't finally save my life By my capacity to believe this but I trust in you and the shape of my life is living out that trust And and believe you me I am a lousy Christian in many many ways because so often I don't trust Jesus right now We're having our we're working on our budget in the church and we're like 30,000 short for the next year And it's like and I know that of that 30,000 A lot of that's going to come out of my mouth And I know that of that 30,000 of the lot of that's going to come out of my salary and so I And so then I have to ask myself do I trust him if I trust him with my death? Do I trust him with my life? Do I? Do I finally believe that Jesus is sufficient to save me in every way I can be saved? To save me body and soul and in life and in death I don't believe it strongly enough. Well, what is it going to take? What do I need to do? Not to earn that but to do to reinforce the elephant and the rider to believe in this thing That's my question. That's my challenge and and the church and worship and and accountability and being part of a body and not Cutting and running when doubts get too high That's part of it So It is a problem but but hence my my commitment to making them deeper and and to reiterate the point I'd be very happy if it was entirely sam harris's all the way down Okay, i'd have no problem with that. It's just that underneath sam harris. It's hell And and Again, I had to listen to the few this a few times to kind of understand what douglas Murray was saying and some of you say I got it the first time so you're smarter than me there you go being Star but maybe that's why i'm a pastor because it takes me a little while to figure things out and I gotta process it through And that helps me then Explain it hopefully but but what murray is saying is that the the enlightenment only got so far and sam is saying well I'm a i'm an evangelist for the enlightenment And and so murray says great. I wish there were more of you but What the enlightenment seemed to do is hollow things out and it's being filled with all kinds of ideologies And made up religions and just like jordan peterson said earlier people are defaulting to their their skin color and their gender and their sexuality and their and their You know their their nationalism they're defaulting to all of the other easy off the shelf religious things That that have ready-made symbols like like nationalism And and they're defaulting to all of this because the enlightenment hollowed it out And and so peterson and doug murray are saying to sam harris. Okay, you're you're You're being an evangelist for the enlightenment and doug murray is saying okay sam. Well, if they were all like you i'd be okay but in your Evangelistic in your atheism evangelism you are continuing the hollowing thing but you're not really addressing the the void and in a sense Sam harris, therefore is the epitome of that because sam harris himself. How did he fill the void? Psychedelics meditation, but as jordan peterson said earlier, it's a watered down buddhism It's not a buddhism that if you go to to tibet or to china or to japan That someone would look at and esteem they'd say yeah you western buddhists and and you see this all over You know go ahead and google How indians feel about american yoga? You know, these are live conversations that are out there Because a lot of the people from the east look at the look at their imagined allies in the west and say you know You're just like you're just like the teenage girl who doesn't believe anything has this nice little gold cross and says well, I believe in jesus and I believe and then it just rattles off all kinds of non-sequitur beliefs that are vaguely associated much more with what hollywood has done with religion than what any coherent religious system has ever done And in a sense that's what's happening Well, i'm also curious you know me too well curious about something that you yeah that has to be very carefully edited on youtube I hope I was faithful to it in the in the in the metaphysics that you outlined Rationality in the service of love like this is an interesting like i'm not sure you get to get away with that because Like is it rationality or is it love? Because I don't understand the place in your conceptual system for love given your emphasis on rationality as the ethic of as the mechanism of ethics So I would say to the degree that I smuggle in jesus which by the way isn't accidental in some sense And i'm fully conscious when i'm doing it you smuggle in love and it essentially plays the same role Well, no, no love but love is a an experienced reality. I mean love love is a state of consciousness. It's a state And this is where I think we really see the poverty of of sam's position Of and I wouldn't ultimately fact well, it's a it's a fact that one can experience it or not. Well, yeah It's a fact that one can experience it or not just like well you've just hollowed out Your your your Your whole project about facts you just you just gave it up And you don't even know you gave it up Jordan peterson knows you gave it up Yeah, but that's not the same thing no it is no it is It's a fact that you can experience something but the thing that you're experiencing is there's also the thing that Go ahead and look at rationality rules. Go ahead and understand a fact is a thing whether I know it or not That's their main point this objective Monarchical view of the world that they say they have access to that's the point and now when he gets to the center of his Schema. Well, I thought it was well-being now. It's love Love is a fact I don't know how your system Has capacity for that and peterson's about to go off on it that you're experiencing as a fact Well, what though that there are facts about the the the range of human experiences I say and not even I'm just human just conscious experiences that if we can build computers they can feel love stop We don't even know What it means for another human being to feel love But we have an idea that they feel love because we feel love Please tell me how you could build a computer that you would know would feel love Please tell me how you could build a computer that you would know would feel Anything this is the fact guy I can't believe he just said that And that's not inconceivable and will either succeed in doing that or not But consciousness admits of a range of experiences and Love is One of the best on offer. It's not the only one we care about but it's the one that anchors So is it the top or not the top? us to a positive commitment to the well-being of other conscious systems and But it's not but the but the crucial thing is the fact I agree with you You know what it is it is a fact that loving someone if you want to go through all the four lectures, that's eight hours plus Count how many times Jordan Peterson will say to Sam Harris? That's not a fact for all kinds of things That Jordan Peterson knows if you're not going to have a void you need these things And and Sam Harris said that is a fact So on one hand Sam Harris wants to say it's facts facts facts But then anything can be a fact for Sam Harris if he needs it entails a Really other things there are there are love and it's counterfeits right there people can confuse, you know romantic you know attachment or lust with love right so I've been and the and A few minutes ago what you said was necessary to talk to someone Who has just lost their son, please tell me What love requires? Buddhists are especially good at differentiating these various states of consciousness and and uh, it's a it You know for him hinduism and buddhism seem like a tree that he scurries under whenever he has an answer. He can't uh, he something he can't answer which is ironic because You know, usually it's it's waving the flag of rationality. But now he scurries under the tree of buddhism and hinduism a This this true pleasure mental pleasure in the company of another that is colored by A commitment to their well-being a wanting them to be happy a wanting them wanting to have their hopes realized a non-zero-sum commitment uh Or sense of of your entanglement with them and you can see your failures to love me You can be with people who you think you love, you know I'm with my best friend say and I just find out something fantastic has happened for him Let's say in his career and I feel a moment of envy say well, then you see well, okay What just how much do you love this person if that your first reaction? To this something good happening to them is you feel poorer for it, right? That's the kane and abel story exactly. So In your mind and yes you pay enough attention to the nature to what it's like to be you the full horror show of Of an almost, you know biblical unwinding of all possibility is available. Yes and once Misery deliverance gratitude misery deliverance gratitude misery deliverance gratitude Once you realize how miserable you are and once you realize how short your life is And once you realize that you've done things that you cannot undo and you have hurt people in ways that cannot be undone Where do you go with that? Who can help you you need a savior bigger than yourself? You know and it's and you add psychedelics to that cocktail and it gets even more vivid But so are you are you saying that this is it? But the thing that that's a like it is a fact these are facts about the human mind and it is also factual to say That it is possible Are these facts any different from the fact that any other assertion Because what he's basically said that all assertions are facts Well, you can you can turn an assertion into a fact because it's a fact that sam asserted it. So now it's a fact So but then you take the fact and you bring it over to your other system and say it's only facts Well, once I asserted i've made it a fact. So now it's a fact Possible to navigate in this space it is possible to design Institutions and and social systems and ethical commitments that help us navigate in this space But this is where we started the question This is how we started this range of the conversation because jordan peterson said the atheists have had very little success Creating the kinds of things that would enable them to create cohesive Communities that fill the void and now sam harris is just asserting that this is what we can do But it hasn't been done It's not that we all have to get up every morning naked and try to Rebuild civilization and all of human wisdom for ourselves each day you we inherit We we inherit the most useful tools tools Oh It's like we've spent eight hours making a point and he gives it away, but he doesn't know he gives it away it's kind of like I fired him because of the russian thing Okay You don't have to figure this all out for yourself and my my appeal to you Is that what We should want to use Because the love thing peterson is right. You just ripped that off from jesus Two commandments I give you summarize the law and the prophets love the lord your god We can't do that because you're sam harris love your neighbor as yourself. I'll take that one. There you go Your secularism is christianity Demythified That's what it is it's what it's always been it's what jordan peterson is telling you it's been That's your whole system sam christianity demythified and what peterson is saying is The myth isn't going to go unnoticed. Its absence will be felt it creates a void And this is why Doug harris says this is why europe is crumbling that void Is needed to mobilize people to stand To have something to as c.s. Lewis said to not be men without chests Read the abolition of man, please read the abolition of man All the best tools available Without hamstringing ourselves by this notion that certain tools Your tools have foundations Are Must be the best for all time or certain books must be read On every page with equal diligence because It this book came from the creator of the universe jefferson's bible never caught on When we're reading marcus aurelius if he gets something catastrophically wrong on page 17 We say well, what the hell he he lived 2 000 years ago. There's no way he knew everything, right? and this exactly is the point because Because How can you be freed from your own biases? How can you be freed from the own the the narrowness of your own? idiosyncratic life of your 80 years of your one single person and jordan peterson's project says We have been built up these structures these hardened soft structures from below have been built into us And we need these these are our a priority filter that we use to Appropriate facts and we need all of this and sam harris says I will stand in judgment over anything I read I want this I don't want this Well, you know what you're going to be as shallow as the girl at the mall because that's what she does Right and we turn the page okay, so we can't do that with the bible poor peterson mythological representation of that so There's an ancient he doesn't want a mythological representation of that. That's his point idea A very ancient idea that when you face the void What you do is confront it and leap into it And what you discover at the bottom is a beast and inside that beast you discover your father Lying dead and then you reanimate your father and you bring him back to the surface and that's The means of dealing with the void he doesn't want a mythological representation of it. That's his point He doesn't want mythology and he says we don't need it and he's about to demonstrate that again Right, and so in his in essence in some sense. That's just what you said You said that we accept accept that again this There's something Confabulatory about that because you can do you I I could change the valence of virtually every word you use there And it would also sound profound and true. I could I could And right here, I think we see something key about harris is that everything gets boiled down to In in christianity there's something that we call sacramentalism and it's the idea that for example When I as a protestant pastor say this is my body now I don't This gets into the war of the reformation But what I don't mean when I say this is my body that if you take that bread and you take it to a lab you find human genetic material from the first century Ad that's not what i'm saying but that And i'm also not a swinglian So i'm a calvinist a calvinist say is that christ is spiritually. I know it's a word that fudges You got to be careful with it christ is spiritually present in the body and the in the body and the drink in the sacrament He's spiritually present and he feeds our spirits with his life That's what the sacrament means and in order to do that what you have to do is have this mythic Imagination that says that there's a connection between what we do here and other things and those are real connections and the The context of these things matters. So the and this is what well I'll just let it play because this is where they're going to go sam harris has no idea of sacramentality partly because the project of the enlightenment was to get rid of sacramentality now part of that is due to the reformation because the reformation Was trying to work on this and to say And so so you've got transubstantiation in the roman catholic Consubstantiation with the luthers the the calvinists with the real spiritual presence of christ in the sacrament and then the swinglians It's a symbol and and the calvinists didn't want to say it's merely a symbol because what we're trying to Get at is the idea which has been lost in the enlightenment that stuff has connections to deeper things And and and this is the line between sam harris and jordan peterson that jordan peterson somehow believes He's trying to get at some kind of sacramentality And sam harris is simply dismissing it Swap father for mother and I could swap void for mountaintop and I and I could it could be the same Seemingly archetypal journey And it's not that easy. No, it's not that easy sam like that's the same thing. It's damn easy I've done it with a cookbook But look if it's that easy then you can write and and the reason sam thinks he's done it is he's because he said Well, I had the feels I had the feels from it. So I swapped it out and I could still produce that feeling Well again, that's sam harris's metric if I can feel it in my little conscious bubble That's as real as it can be and jordan peterson is saying could there be a real world out there Great novels, no, no great stories. Well, if it's that easy, it's not that easy to write a great story So these things can't be swapped out with ease and there is a reason that it's your father that you rescue from the belly Of the beast and not your mother in those sorts of situations. Yeah, but and you wonder why jordan peterson kvetched at pronouns There's a reason it goes deep. He's a sacramentalist So and it is again again, I give you buddhism and hinduism that have that have completely he runs back under the tree different Iconographies and mythologies and well, they're different at some levels But the point and we started out vancouver one saying it's not arbitrary and what sam harris keeps saying here is it's arbitrary Not at all. It's like languages, but but they're at some levels. They're not at all They're crucially opposite in many of these cases. I'm just saying that this this kind of of reading meaning into story is There's a reason why it's not science Because it's because it and now we're back at harris's materialism. There is no meaning in story It has to be read in meaning as a product of the brain again read cs lewis's The the abolition of man because cs lewis's book the abolition of man is entirely about this Is in some basic sense unfalsifiable There's nothing you and I can do for the rest of our lives to be sure that the mother isn't at the bottom of that void And it's really the possible to develop a factual approach to the analysis of literature Well, yes on its own and again cs lewis. He was an english scholar. This is the point of his book Terms you can say well it but that that extends to things like it is a fact That hamlet was the prince of denmark and no I meant in terms of the meaning of literature Well, yeah, but you can make true and and false claims or more and less plausible claims about literature But that's what i'm trying to do or it's more to fix on you But again, but this again, it's effects on you. That's their sam harris is right there Different game than what most religious people think is on offer Well, look if you look at the domain of science most scientists aren't very good at what they do And if you look at the domain of religious thinking most religious thinking people aren't very good at what they do But that doesn't mean that the whole damn thing should be thrown out. There's gradations of religious revelation and and and and wisdom but but there's that word because Revelation if if revelation is something that we can all do And so right here you can see the connection between sacramentality and revelation that That things in this world Connect us to deeper things than merely the phenomenology You know you me and marcus aurelius, right? That is a very different world than the world that muslims think they're living in but you just said sam that we have to go This is why I used the the going down into the void to rescue your father metaphor You just said that we have and you've said this before and I know you believe it as well That we have to go back into the past and find The the the wisdom that can help guide us because we don't have to do this as if we're encountering everything for the first time And that's exactly the idea of go So peterson's been tracking he heard sam harris give up the game now sam harris is running back the other way And peterson's calling him on it going into the void to rescue your father. That's how that is the Eternal age-old medication for the confrontation of the void and you said it yourself And so I don't know which it is It's like do we have to go into the past to rescue what's best given the understanding that there is something there worth rescuing Or not is it pure rationality and nothing else moving forward? unconstrained by convention it is it's it's just Again, it's it's I want our certainties And I think we all I I just don't think sam harris has thought any of this through Oh in every other area of our lives we agree about this effortlessly, right? If i'm pretending to be certain of something that you can sense I have no good reason to be certain about you begin to mistrust me in every area if it's in business or if it's in Sports or if I told you I knew that france was going to win the world cup and I was absolutely sure and and And yet I magically didn't bet any money on it Uh, I mean these are these are conversations we can have about everything else and yet on this topic of religion People change the rules, right? And i'm i'm just arguing that the rules should never the rules of by which we Dole out what you're saying is that you're living in different worlds Our creedence shouldn't change and and if they don't and again, it's it's we shouldn't be misled by the the duration of the past I mean this is what's this is the the The comparison of something like Scientology to Christianity is so invidious because We can practically meet l ron hubbard, right? We've got film of him Confabulating about the galaxies that ruled by by overlords whose names he magically knew right? We see we see the man behind the curtain We don't see that with the apostle paul or or anyone else who brought us the the the quote real religions Okay time What's the difference between The apostle paul and l ron hubbard Well, why don't you read a book on manichaeism? And read about manny and read about the ideas that manny had about these just just read a book about manichaeism It's a wild ride. And if you read manichaeism Something about manichaeism you and then you read l ron hubbard. You'll say wow These two guys really thought some crazy stuff Peterson is making the point. He says there's a darwinian exercise here that's going on and the the The bigger the the truer things last longer, okay and and so in a sense That which survives in a darwinian competition Likely has more truth to it. All right, so So sam harris is saying oh it's only time because we don't know the roots of the apostle paul isn't crazy like l ron hubbard ah But what the apostle paul wrote go ahead and look at tom holland and nt. Wright's conversation on unbelievable A month and a half or so ago Tom holland isn't a christian. He's a historian You fail to appreciate the contribution that The apostle paul made now you might as well say well, there's sam harris and there's socrates And well, you know, the only difference is that Socrates lived a long time ago. But if we if we knew socrates we would think he's sam harris. I don't think so I don't think so. There's a reason socrates has the valence has the value That he does in our society and it's not Because he made noises here's the question 200 years from now will anybody care about sam harris Do anybody care about paul vanderkley anybody? Will anybody care about jordan peterson? We don't know But 200 years from now We'll say something And yet it's always just been human beings doing this right and and and if you go back far enough They were doing it In a in a situation that was completely Uncontaminated by the kinds of concerns we have as scientists and and secular rational people But the the point that it's been useful to people for 2000 years Is testimony to something which is something that jordan peterson has said numerous times but No traction on sam for evidence and consistency and a knowledge of the past I mean they had nothing even record they had no mechanism by which to record their observations. No, that isn't true Um, if you I last week I preached on nahum. I'm preaching on obadiah We know from mari which is a city in messapotamia That prophets were out there and when someone would do a prophetic utterance, they would record it Well, how would they record it? They didn't have paper. Well go to a museum You'll see these tiny little plate tablets with all these things like chicken marks in it Well, what were those that was how they recorded stuff now, you might not recognize it as recording but there's receipts There's bills there's writings They recorded this and so prophets would make their would make their Prognostications and they would write them down and when one of them came true, they would say, huh? We should look at that look at my sermon last week about nate silver We do the same thing today sam harris. Those they didn't do any of that sam doesn't know any history read a little history sam Yeah, and i'm going to interrupt you yes, because first of all, I saw a sign saying fine and they're out of time so So that's That's just kind of a run through of most of the second half of the london exchange and I think a lot of the issues come out there and I think you know Not all of you are going to want to watch this thing all the times that I did so I watch it for you. There's my commentary again, as I said before they touch on a lot of these kind of Uh atheist tropes that i'm gonna want to deal with and and what I think we really want to deal with is the question. Okay, um How can we understand well-being? How can we understand justice? How can we understand truth? Well, this is the conversation that human beings have been having for a very long time Let's figure out how to do it. Well, so there we are
