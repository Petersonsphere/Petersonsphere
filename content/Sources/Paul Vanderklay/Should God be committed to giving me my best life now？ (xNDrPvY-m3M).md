 Hi, this is Paul and this is my rough draft for Sunday video Whenever I do this, I always think how rough is this draft some weeks It's pretty rough and a fair amount of sermonizing goes on between Friday and Sunday Even if I don't technically touch it on Saturday Sunday morning I usually get up and and work on it and polish it off and then hopefully we'll see if it flies by 11 o'clock Freddy's here in the sanctuary today. Freddy called me. I want to practice my raps and so he's practicing his raps and He swears he'll leave me alone so I can get my work done He's not real good at that so I told him I'd see him in an hour and it'll probably be 15 minutes So if I get interrupted I get interrupted I've been trying to keep my church a little bit up to date on what I do with my videos since they pay for my time and then inevitably some of my church time gets into making videos and I do see this as a part of My ministry as a pastor. It's also part of my hobby and avocation. So I worked on a lot of Sam Harris this week and worked on Figuring out what he believes about consciousness and discerning his philosophy of life Positive consciousness is what he's looking for and this reminded me of CS Lewis's quip in the problem of pain by the goodness of God We mean nowadays almost exclusively his lovingness and in this we may be right and By love in this context most of us mean kindness and CS Lewis often notes the when we reduce Love to kindness. We're missing whole parts of the world Love to kindness we're missing whole portions of what love is the desire to see others The desire to see others than the happy Self not happy in this way or that but just happy that would really satisfy us What would really satisfy us would be a God who says of anything we happen to like doing? What does it matter as long as they are contented? We want in fact so not so much a father in heaven as a grandfather in heaven a senile benevolence who as they say Like to like to see the young people enjoying themselves Whose plan for the universe was simply that it might be truly said at the end of each day a good time was had by all Now I've been doing a lot of thinking about consciousness in the last couple of weeks and consciousness is this funny thing It's this cloud of awareness that that we pass from moment to moment and sometimes these these can be pain Sometimes these can be pleasure often we fall into despair consciousness is a very powerful thing in human beings and and so what we what we often try to do is differentiate the self a little bit from consciousness and have that self have a little bit of Historical awareness and a little bit of ballast and a little bit of balance But often that self just stands a little bit a part of the consciousness looking at it Evaluating judging wanting planning trying to control or manage and then truth is we're not terribly good at this We are not transparent to ourselves nor in control even of ourselves very much We have repeated admission admonitions to eat right and exercise to save for college or retirement to to consider your your next life perhaps if you're religious or Or what the world you're leaving the children if you're irreligious so the environment the national debt What have you but we seldom do any of this and in fact and even when we do do it the best plans We have fall apart I've mentioned in last week's sermon this Walter Scheidel book the great lever leveler we worry about economic inequality and and and what we often find is that That The differences between governments are make relatively little difference It's just tinkering and then you look at say you've all know a Harare's vision of the future It's you know, it's we there's a reason we're anxious inside this this Shakespeare quote Comes to mind cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war that seems to be where all of our Imaginations go in the future walking dead zombie apocalypse environmental degradation Now we've been talking about the rise and fall of the kingdom and we've seen that is this in our long journey from through the Old Testament from Judges Joshua judges Ruth first and second Samuel first and second Kings We see the the rise of the kingdom and good kingdom David. Oh, here's Freddie And then we have Solomon and David tells Solomon to You know stay faithful to God and murder your enemies and then Solomon's reign is is Is image like the kingdom of God coming the temple is rebuilt. It's the Garden of Eden. It's heaven and earth meat It's God's present on earth and presence on earth and Solomon asked for wisdom But then Solomon himself falls and is corrupted and he's corrupted by the the the pagan foreign wives He enslaves his own people he amasses great wealth and then the kingdom splits over taxes Now and we talked last week about how the fact that even in the Bible Ahab is is an image of an evil kingdom And an evil king kind of the the paradigmatic evil king the Israel was doing great Israel was prosperous Israel was Prosperous Israel was Subduing its neighbors. It was keeping Aram down and and Elijah of course arose and and Complained and and called out and destroyed the the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel But then ran away in terror and God tells him you need to you need to anoint Elisha You need to anoint Hazael and you need to anoint. J. Hugh and Elisha Reluctantly only does one-third of the job that he's asked now What we're about to do is is a lot of reading in this story and the thing that Probably will capture your minds is what is at stake in these stories? But a better question might be when was it at stake and for whom? You see consciousness is the cloud of now But there are many many nows and many many people and and what we tend to do is project ourselves Into that and and one of the questions that we might ask is that well, what were they doing? Are there any temples of Baal around today? Why not? Well history is written written by the winners, but is J. Hugh the winner we're looking for The prophet Elisha summoned a man from the company of prophets and said tuck your cloak in your belt Take this flask of olive oil with you and go to Ramoth Gilead When you get there look for J. Hugh son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi Go to him get him away from his companions and take him into an inner room Then take the flask and pour the oil on his head and declare this is what the Lord says I anoint you King over Israel then open the door and run don't delay now Ramoth Gilead is where King Joram is fighting a battle and he's got King Ahaziah from Judah with him there too. And so general J. Hugh is there But there's obviously stuff going on and now notice the commands of Elisha are pretty sparse And it seems like the the young prophet that J that Elisha sends is about to add a little bit of Interpretation into the mix the young prophet went to Ramoth Gilead and when he arrived he found the army officers sitting together I have a message for you commander He said which of us asked J. Hugh for you commander He replied J. Hugh got up and went into the house then the prophet poured the oil on J Hugh's head and announced this is what the Lord the God of Israel says I anoint you King over the Lord's people Israel You are to destroy the house of Ahab your master And I will avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all the Lord's servants shed by Jezebel The whole house of Ahab will perish I will cut off Ahab every male in Israel Slaver free I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat and like the house of Baisha Son of Ahijah as for Jezebel dogs will devour her on the plot of ground at Jezreel and no one will bury her Then he opened the door and ran Hmm Wow a little bit more than Elisha told him now This is where it gets interesting because you remember that Samuel goes and now an anoints David Does David what does David do right then in fact? What does David what is David reluctant to do all along? Why doesn't David assassinate Saul in fact part of the whole focus of the book the early parts of the book of Samuel is on Dave about David and precisely this point But now we should pay attention to Jehu and she we should pay attention to corruption because if the house of Ahab or the house of Omri were noble wonderful loyal Kings well What would their servants be how would their servants feel or is the world really? Dog eat dog each one to their own consciousness When Jehu went out to his fellow officers one of them asked him is everything all right? Why did this maniac come to you now pause? This young prophet he's a maniac pay attention to the words the Hebrew scribes were masters of words Maniac and and and so much is in this and so much of the context is in this one little Interchange it's amazing amazing literature You know the man and the sort of things he says Jehu replied oh those priests Oh those religious not the priests the prophets. Oh those prophets. Oh those Religious people Jehu's gonna get plenty religious, but in a certain way Jehu replied that's not true. They said tell us Jehu said here's what they told me This is what the Lord says I anoint you King over Israel They quickly took their cloaks and spread them out They quickly took their cloaks and spread them under him on the bare steps boy did they cave fast Boy, where's their allegiance? What kind of structures do our dog eat dog? Everyone for themselves. It's my happiness that that is most important What kind of structures do these does this really create? Where is the loyalty? Where is the sacrifice? Where is the the honor where is dare I say even the religion That we might call nationalism or loyalty or any of those religions They blew the trumpet and shouted Jehu is king. Oh Boy, they're all in on the plot now So Jehu's John and son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram That didn't take much did God tell him to turn David didn't turn Now Joram and all Israel had been defending Ramoth Gilead against Haseel king of Aram But King Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds the Arameans had inflicted on him in the battle with Haseel King of Aram Jehu said if you desire to make me king don't let anyone slip out of the city to go and tell the news in Jezreel The plot is unfolding the coup is underway They got into his chariot and then he got into his chariot and rode to Jezreel Because Joram was resting there and King Ahaziah king of Judah had gone down to see him Pause pause, where's my cursor? Oh Where was I that wasn't even Freddie that was someone else Sometimes hard to get your work done Oh Okay, so Jehu Jehu gets into his chariot and he rides to Jezreel because Joram was resting there and King Ahaziah of Judah Had gone down to see him When the lookout standing on the tower in Jezreel saw Jehu's troops approaching he called out I see troops coming get a horseman Joram answered send him to meet them and ask do you come in peace? The horsemen rode off to meet Jehu and said this is what the king says. Do you come in peace? What do you have to do with peace? Jehu replied fallen behind me Lookout reported the messenger has reached them, but he isn't coming back So the king sent out a second horseman when he came to them. He said this is what the king says Do you come in peace Jehu replied? What do you what do you have to do with peace fallen behind me? The lookout reported he has reached them, but he isn't coming back either The driving is like Jehu son of Nimshi. He drives like a maniac the same root word gets repeated The Prophet the king has turned into a prophet not unlike Saul Not unlike David but Jehu and David are very different. We've already seen the contrast between Jehu and David There's a lot more similarity between Jehu and Saul Hitch up my chariot Joram ordered and then he hitched it up Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah rode out each with his own chariot to meet Jehu They met him in the plot of ground that belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite Remember Naboth look up Naboth what happened with Naboth? Wasn't Ahab blubbering like a child and Jezebel comes to Ahab and says why are you crying your king? Just take his vineyard and turn it into your vegetable garden. That's what you should do and they concocted a Legal religious excuse to have Naboth killed Then Joram saw Jehu he asked have you come in peace Jehu? How can there be peace Jehu replied as long as all the idolatry and witchcraft of your mother Jezebel abound Jehu's got religion Then Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram between the shoulders The arrow pierced his heart and he slumped down in his chariot Jehu said to Bidka his chariot officer pick him up and throw him on the field that belongs to Naboth Naboth the Jezreelite Remember how you and I were riding together in the chariot behind Ahab his father when the Lord spoke this prophecy against him Yesterday I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons declared the Lord I will surely make you pay for it on this plot of ground declares the Lord Now then pick him up and throw him on that plot in accordance to the word of the Lord When a Hazziah king of Judah saw what had happened he fled up the road to Beth Hagen Jehu chased him shouting kill him too. They wounded him in his chariot on the way up to Ger near Ibliam But he escaped to Megiddo and died there his servants took him by chariot to Jerusalem and buried him with his Ancestors in his tomb in the city of David in the 11th year of Joram son of Ahab a Hazziah had become king of Judah Just to keep the timing straight When Jehu went to Jezreel then Jehu went to Jezreel when Jezebel heard about him She put on eye makeup arranged her hair and looked out the window. Oh my So few words so much meaning As Jehu entered the gate she asked have you come in peace you Zimri you murderer of your masters she's got She's trying to recapture her beauty and she's trying to grasp at morality But her beauty and her morality both were thin She looked up at the window. He looked up at the window and called out who is on my side who? Two of three of the eunuchs looked down at him now the fact that these are eunuchs as important because anyone following the law of Israel would not have made eunuchs because it was in fact against the law of Israel to create eunuchs why eunuchs were a standard part of Turning slaves into loyal permanent slaves by giving them no future by literally cutting them off Will they be loyal to Jezebel these eunuchs will the will the conventional wisdom of all the foreign empires hold with With Jehu throw her down Jehu said so they threw her down and some of her blood splattered the wall And the horses as they trampled her underfoot ghastly Jehu went in and ate and drank take care of that cursed woman He said and bury her for she was a king's daughter didn't have that much didn't have that much mercy for the king But when they went out to bury her they found nothing except her skull her feet and her hands Remember Dagon the idol of the philistines when they put the ark of the covenant in his temple And how his head and his hands are cut off the second time They went back and told Jehu who said this is the word of the who said this is the word of the lord That he spoke through his servant Elijah the tishbite on the plot of ground at jezreel dogs will devour Jezebel's flesh Jezebel's body will be like dung on the ground in the plot of jezreel Never see your dog eat poop So that no one will be able to say this is Jezebel. She won't even have A tomb Now there were in samaria 70 sons of the house of ahab So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to samaria to the officials of jezreel to the elders and the guardians of ahab's children Will they be loyal? Will they have some inner core that leads them to sacrifice? No He said you are your master sons You have your master sons with you and have chariots and horses a fortified city in the middle of the world You have chariots and horses a fortified city and weapons you have a fighting chance Now as soon as this letter reaches you choose the best and most worthy of your master's sons and set him on your father's throne Then fight for your master's house Servants of the house of ahab of the house of omni omri be men No, they won't there's no There there in this kingdom. There's no Nobility it's only corruption. It's everyone for himself and the happiness of his consciousness But they were terrified and said if two kings could not resist them How can we so the palace administer the city governor the elders and the guardian sent a message to jehu they all cave This kingdom is corrupt from the inside We are your servants and we will do anything you say we will not anoint We will not appoint another king you do whatever you think is best general jehu Then jehu wrote a second letter saying if you are on my side and will obey me take the heads of your master's sons And come to me in jezreel by this by this time tomorrow Now the royal princes 70 of them were there with the leading men of the city who were rearing them When the letter arrived these men took the princes and slaughtered all 70 of them They were slaughtered the boys that they had been raising like sons There is no core to this kingdom. There is only corruption There is no character. There is there is no loyalty. There is nothing Well, what is this connected to the eunuchs to jezebel? They put their heads in their baskets and sent them to jehu and jezreel when the messenger arrived He told jehu and they put their heads They have brought the heads of the princes then jehu ordered put them into two piles at the entrance of the city gate until morning standard operating procedure for the ancient near east And then the bloodbath continues there will be a link here between a hazaya and Between a hazaya and jezebel as you can see because adelaia Jezebel's daughter has become a queen in the southern kingdom God is cutting this off. God is cutting this out He lures jehu lures all the prophets and worshippers of baal into the temple in samaria and slaughters them destroys the temple of yale of of yale as baal of baal and as And as the the scribes that wrote the book of kings note It was continued to be used as a toilet to that day in samaria So when he left there he came above Jehonadab son of rakab who was on his way and jehu greeted him Are you in accord with me as I am with you? I am jehonadab said if so, he said Give me your hand so he did and jehu helped him up into the chariot Jehu said come with me and see my zeal for the lord Then he had him ride along on the chariot when jehu came to samaria He killed all who were left there of ahab's family He destroyed them according to the word of the lord spoken to elijah this zeal will be a powerful thing in the story of israel And everyone will look to jesus to have this kind of zeal and paul had this kind of zeal and he used this zeal To persecute the followers of jesus Back again to jacob lul who notes the strange thing in this book where Prosperity and good times reign with the evil kings and now with well nobody's really going to call jehu that good The kingdom is a severe disappointment because haziel Continues to reign in on the northern kingdom and in fact things get so bad The king of assyria for aid against the king of aram the house of jehu was the longest reign in the north In that sense the most successful but they never gave up the golden calf cult to the lord Haziel ravages jehu's house and the sons of jehu brought in the assyrians to get relief from haziel The assyrians would eventually destroy the kingdom of haziel To get relief from haziel the assyrians would eventually destroy the northern kingdom What seemed like the beginning of a happy story for jehu was a very unhappy story It didn't go well even for his sons jehu grabs the throne But the throne isn't what he hopes it will be Now we read the text with our little moral consciousness and we sit here and we judge god for not Maximizing the happiness of all the characters in the story. Isn't that what god should be about? Well, what have we learned in this moment of reflection? Well, we've learned exactly what our god is and who we imagine him to be And these are the judgments that we use to judge the story that we read Are we really just projecting ourselves into the story imagining ourselves as the occupants of of samaria or jezreel? And we're like people channeling our past lives While I used to be a prince in samaria, ooh bad choice Don't we do this every time we go to the movies? Haven't we been culturally conditioned to do this? Well, what is morality? The house of amri ahab and jezebel all function with the goal of their conscious happiness getting what they want We might not like their methods, but we certainly share their goals The house collapses because everyone else is doing the same thing If jayhue looks to be willing Um, if jayhue looks to be that should say winning i'm gonna pause and edit now If jayhue seems to be winning well throw the queen out the window probably a little Upset about what has been done to them to make them unix. Well, maybe they are maybe they aren't Maybe they're just planning on being faithful unix for jayhue's household What will jayhue do with all of the mess left behind by the house of amri? Jayhue is a dog of war. That's exactly who he is and god unleashes him on the northern kingdom They wanted to be just like the other kingdoms and they were exactly like the other kingdoms And the the turnover of power is exactly like everyone else It's the same game played over and over and over again. Nothing matters. There is no moral core Jesus says he who lives by the sword dies by the sword Would you like What would it look like to be different? What would it look like to be different from this and now we all have tastes of this I mean if you just watch almost any movie you you prize the person who is noble who can resist themselves who who is sacrificial and you know, maybe i'm a little too unkind to sam harris because from what I see Sam harris has some of those qualities many many many of us do And and what I think is that he doesn't i'm glad he lives better than the poverty of his philosophy because You would have to be willing you would have to willingly embrace a sacrificial suffering for others And you would have to call that good as we commonly and normally do this is the kind of thing that we do You would have to know that your suffering would in the very long term accomplish something good Even on the level of good consciousness for others. I'm not saying good consciousness is a bad thing It in fact is a is a worthy goal and a worthy thing, but it cannot be the central goal What would living this way cost you? Well now we see why we don't If you live this way in order to save yourself morally well, that's a little bit easier Because again, we're self-centered and it doesn't undo our self-centered nature It would undercut your own moral effort. In fact, it would be selfish and transactional To do it for others would cost that would cost you everything because there's no end to what the world will take If you let it in the door, does that make any sense? What if someone did it for you, however? Because you couldn't do it for yourself What would you think of such a person? What if in fact someone had done it for you? And maybe you're not too cognizant of it. You're not too aware of it. You're not terribly in touch with it What would be the best way to say thanks to say thank you for such a gift? For such a gift What would be beautiful? What would be noble? What would be heroic? Can you see all the qualities? that The Baal cult had so hollowed out of the northern kingdom You get later on into the book of ezekiel and ezekiel say will say what's true in the temple gets played out in the streets of the city That's almost always true. Isn't that what son sue says? This isn't New information. This is stuff we all know but Could there be a man who gave himself? for others The best man would of course have to be a perfect man And the best sacrifice would of course have to be An unjust sacrifice one where his life was taken from him, but it would have to at the same time be a willing sacrifice And again anybody who's listening to this who's been reared in the christian reform church at least 50 years ago will know This sounds like the heideberg catechism misery deliverance gratitude. Isn't this all those same things? What if the person who did it for you? demonstrated resurrection And promised it to you too. In other words It is not It is not It is not irresponsible to voluntarily Give your life your time your money your interest your devotion your allegiance Those things are not irresponsible because actually We wring our hands about how all those people died and rightfully so We wring our hands at the unjust death of people today rightfully so death takes all It's only a matter of timing and it's a matter of how and those things matter I'm not I don't want to diminish those things but What are you really trying to save and what do you really have to lose? And what would be the most noble the most beautiful the most honorable the best way to spend your life The story of jahe was one servant rebelling after his mat rebelling from his master after another And it's contrasted with a david who had every reason to kill sol And wouldn't well Maybe this says something about david. Maybe they maybe this is why david was not a perfect man Maybe this is why David at least is a better king than jahe or ahab or joram or ahaziah Maybe we're beginning to see the structure of this world here and maybe we're beginning to see What the greatest king would look like? And shouldn't we want to follow the greatest king? What if a person did this for you?
