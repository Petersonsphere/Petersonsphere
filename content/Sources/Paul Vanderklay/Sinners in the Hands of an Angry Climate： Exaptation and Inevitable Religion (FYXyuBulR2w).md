 Hi, this is Paul. Sorry for the lack of video production lately. I was sick this weekend. I bought a car. My wife started work and she's having to do distance teaching, which means she has to make videos, but because of COVID, I'm not allowed to even enter her school to help her. So I do a lot of tech support and giving her a bunch of equipment and I'm updating my own rig here and, and, and. So hence the lack of video production lately. But, and I've really been wrestling with a whole cluster of ideas lately that I've been trying to figure out how to articulate. The sound in the Jerry Falwell Jr. video was low. Rick actually made a copy of that and fixed the sound for me. And so Rick and I have been learning to do more stuff better. But let's, let's jump into today's thing. I'm trying to figure out too, how to, I'm just, I'm just always trying to make the system better, figure out what I'm doing and all that. Anyway, on with the matter at hand. Are the California fires the day of the Lord? And those of you who listen to my sermons know that I play with this, this theme a lot. The day of the Lord is a very interesting and important biblical theme. And it gets into a lot of issues that common spirituality, which is sort of paganish in many ways, even that word. I mean, part of the, part of the reality of making videos for the last two and a half years is that I, three, going on three years, we're getting into fall, is that all of my words are conflicted and I use them much more self-consciously. But the day of this, the day of the Lord is an important biblical theme. It arises in the book of Joel and with all the California wildfires, this verse rings through my head. I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and billows of smoke. The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved for on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, there will be deliverance as the Lord has said, even among the survivors whom the Lord calls. So it's, it's a very, the book of Joel is a very interesting book and the passage is interesting and Joel sort of launches this, this day of the Lord theme. You'll find it in the book of Isaiah, the day of the Lord imagery, you'll find deeply in the book of Revelation, you'll find it in the crucifixion scenes of Jesus, you'll find it in other themes that Jesus brings out. It's basically the idea of the, the proximity or distance to the Lord. Now the Lord obviously is the God of the Hebrews and the Hebrew conception of God and, and God's presence is a very interesting thing. Sometimes it can be close, sometimes it can be far away. You'll hear this in Christian language, I'm sure it's also in Jewish language, but the day of the Lord is, is always sort of a two-faced thing. It's judgment day and it's, and judgment day is also sort of two-faced because it's day of reward and day of punishment. Now as has been in the news all over the world because that's sort of how the news works these days, California has been burning and Donald Trump even came to, President Trump even came to visit California lately and came to Sacramento and I was pleased to see how to reasonable sit down with the governor and they both were able to sort of lay the, the, the political sloganing aside at least for a moment. And of course Governor Newsom tends to in his presentations accent climate change and President Trump tends to emphasize forest management. I think something like 50 percent, 57 percent of forests in California are actually federal forests, national forests. There's a, the West has a huge amount of federal land and, and that it's included in the state of California and I know all over the world there's all these images of California but California is a massive state and it's a strange state in that there are very urban areas and there are very rural areas and, and the rural areas are sometimes very beautiful, very desolate. Some of the poverty in the rural areas is worse than some of the poverty in urban areas. It's a very complex state. It's a very dry state. We get rain mostly during the winter months, not during the summer months but you know obviously there are serious wildfires going on up in Oregon and Washington. Now in the past this kind of thing would have, people would have talked about this in religious terms. They would have imagined it in religious terms. Religious imagery, what again today we think of as religious would have dominated how they talk about these things. Now today, well when this happens, people get nervous. So in 2005, Pat Robertson, who was the host of the 700 Club, raised quite a few eyebrows with, well he was used to doing that quite a bit back in the day, claimed that Katrina was God's omen of punishment on the United States and this was roundly dismissed. His quote went something like this, you know it's just amazing though that people say the litmus test for the Supreme Court nominee of John Roberts is whether or not he's, he supports the wholesale slaughter of unborn children. We've killed 40 million unborn babies. This is 2005. I was reading yesterday a book that was very interesting about what God said to the Old Testament about those who shed innocent blood and he used the term that those who do this, the land will vomit you out and you look at the book of Leviticus and you see what it says and the author of this says, well vomit out means not able to defend yourself but we have found we are unable to defend ourselves against some of the attacks that are coming against us either by terrorists or now by natural disaster. So of course 2005 was just four years away from 9-11 so terrorism was very much on the mind of the country. Justice Roberts was the Chief Justice and he was nominated by George W. Bush and here Pat Robertson connects Hurricane Katrina and the devastation that it caused with abortion. Now Al Gore to Congress in 2007 didn't make the causal links quite so clear but pretty much intimated that well you know it's climate change that was causing more and more frequent hurricanes. Now what's interesting is that in many ways even though someone might say yeah but you know what's coming out the the back end of a cow or the back end of an exhaust pipe or a factory smokestack sure seems at least in our minds scientifically connected to increasing rates of destructive hurricanes, increasing wildfires, all of those things. So we can kind of imagine but we can't imagine how let's say aborting babies might be related to it because of course in Pat Robertson's imaginary the offense about killing the innocent is perceived by a conscious god and that conscious god then decides to punish the nation and so just sort of playing civilization or another game sort of turns up the natural disaster tick and or maybe he points to he points to New Orleans even though New Orleans well New Orleans probably as with the American political divide is really an urban rural divide in many ways too and so whereas Louisiana is a fairly conservative state New Orleans would be probably a little bit more politically progressive than the rest of the state and in fact during Katrina a lot of people postulated one way or another. Other people noted that in many ways Katrina was the marked an end point of George W. Bush's effectiveness as president because the Katrina response was not very well done, heck of a job Brownie, a bunch of those kind of things had happened. So but Al Gore who had lost the presidential campaign to George W. Bush very much wanted to make the focus on climate change. So how does that really work? Whereas Pat Robertson is saying well America because of course only a certain percentage of Americans support a woman's right to choose versus more prohibitions legal prohibitions on abortion. America as a whole is judged and people who perhaps are against abortions suffered from Hurricane Katrina. Similarly your other political sins political sins on the other side of the aisle voting for the wrong party or your environmental sins driving a gas guzzler or not recycling or something like that. The car, the trips, the house that perhaps isn't properly insulated, eating more beef or meat as opposed to plant-based foods, the clothes you wear, the country you live in, the industry you're in yada yada yada these are your political sins and so in either case there's very much a theological narrative except one has a god and the other has an impersonal system which with with which we participate in individually. Now the list is endless though on these political sins as well and it's about more endless than the mosaic code in some ways and now these narratives have continued just a couple of days ago on CNN found this the fires rage out west are unprecedented they're also a mere preview of what a climate of what climate change has to offer so in many ways we are sinners in the hands of an angry climate yet governor Jay Inslee of Washington state says this these are not just wildfires they are climate fires so now we are branding Inslee says and we cannot and we and we cannot and we will not surrender our state and expose our people to have their homes burned down and the lives lost because of climate fires so they're going to double their efforts to stop the climate fires just as in some ways if we employ if we employ pat robertson's idea well if we stop abortion then we'll have fewer hurricanes so Jay Inslee I suppose is going to admonish us to stop doing certain things in most in both cases again that things are political because if you reduce the number of abortions well how many abortions do you have to reduce before god is so angry that he'll stop sending destructive hurricanes and of course people on the other side would say well if if the hurricanes are a result of god's judgment why doesn't god send more hurricanes against new york and new jersey that are pretty reliable progressive states and fewer hurricanes against florida and texas florida is a swing state but texas is a pretty reliable anti-abortion state or alabama or mississippi these tend to be states that have the the biggest difference in that they tend to be the most anti-abortion states so i've just been preaching through the plagues of egypt and a big deal in the plagues of egypt is god begins to discriminate with the plagues against egypt versus against israel well god doesn't seem to be any doing any discrimination there so another fact and in other words he's he's just looking at nations and targeting the united states you're going to have exactly the same problem with these moral sin issues about climate change and in fact governor inslee's language about this gets even more interesting impacts from climate change well now we've left the governor's quotes and now we're just into the reporters reporting impacts from climate change are not 20 or 30 years away inslee says already too many towns have burnt down the governor says and he looks forward to a state being unified to fight this scourge now is the scourge the fires or is the scourge climate change and what would it mean for the state of washington to be unified to fight climate change unified to fight climate change more and would it make a difference now let some of you paint me one way or another with respect to climate change i'm not really a skeptic it just seems reasonable to me that the more co2 you pump into the air it's going to have an impact i'm also not a climatologist and so while i'm not skeptical about the scientists i've been listening to this debate for a long time the catastrophes have not been as dramatic as certain models predicted 20 years ago and you can google that idea at the same time there seems to be evidence that there's warming there is evidence of of of sea change the retired chief meteorologist of the state of california is by no means a political progressive goes to my church and for years he's had he's and this this is what a strange church i have he's had the sea levels at the golden gate bridge marked up on our church bulletin board and he regularly passes out the reports from the california water resources agency about snowpack and we had a rice farmer in the church recently passed away and so this church has actually been following these things quite carefully in many ways not really politically just sort of scientifically if i dare use that word instantly goes on this is not natural well well what do you mean by natural this is not an act of god are you saying you believe in god this is happening because we have changed the climate in the state of washington in dramatic ways have you only changed the climate in the state of washington is he saying there is a god is he saying people aren't a product of nature is governor jay inslee a creationist um because if people are a part of nature then our actions are completely natural and hence you can't really differentiate between the consequence of our actions and the consequence of this construct that you're using when you use the word nature and again i think most of us understand exactly what he's saying here there's an implicit narrative in there but if we pause for a moment and think about these words well we're kind of saying funny things aren't we this is and this is the way we talk now of course in many ways governor jay inslee is a democratically elected official and he is popular because of these ideas and he is popular because of this language just like politicians in red states are popular for avoiding this language or popular for denouncing this language and so round and round we go part of round we go part of democracy is in fact preaching to the choir now this is a graph from 2016 may 2016 so this was during the obama administration and it basically shows countries that are part of a global climate change agreement and have been attempting to keep down their their co2 numbers and then countries that are not and anyone looking at this graph on the youtube version of this will immediately see that for the most part co2 levels in many of the countries in the world in europe the united states and countries in asia that are participating in this climate deal these are mostly developed countries well these countries have for the most part limited at least the growth of their co2 emissions and well hey mission accomplished right isn't isn't that what the whole job is about but in fact if you look at these numbers even if all of these developed countries that are one way or another down for climate change if you reduce their emissions to zero well that obviously would have an impact but um the rest of the world china india africa the middle east could pretty easily outstrip the changes made in those countries now if we look at say the state of washington relatively small population compared especially to something like california let's say the state of washington is a climate change champion well they've got a lot of trees up there um let's look at the state of vermont vermont really a climate change champion they only have half a million people in the entire state it's mostly covered by mountains and trees they're very environmentalist friendly um let's say you're on the vanguard of the of the climate change forces of vermont and let's say you're recycling like a son of a gun you gave up your car you're doing everything you're not going to make a dent in this graph well let's flip the narrative and let's say you're you're 100 opposed to abortion and you're never going to get one and well maybe you're a woman and you're never going to get one well how do you stop other people from getting them and making god mad and hence hitting us with we can make the arguments about wildfires about abortion too i mean we we can run this in many many different ways the developed world when it comes to climate change isn't where these projected increases really are so maybe jay inskeep should well should he ride a jet to india and china and chide them or but now our narratives start to get conflicted because he is in fact a white man and should the white man chide africa and india and china or is that neo-colonialism or are we paying for their sins to come or are they paying for our sins to come or our current sins or basically are we indulging in to use a line from george w bush the soft bigotry of low expectations on the third world that's actually a pretty potent idea we imagine that they are somehow less smart than we in the developed world or do we do imagine they are less morally evolved less on the right side of history than we are here do we imagine that they are somehow childlike are we infantilizing them by not expecting them to to join us in the worldwide challenge of reducing co2 emissions and therefore cooling the planet sufficiently maybe we can't expect the developed world to to understand this like we can many of the developed world said well you made this mess you know why should we have to pay for it you had the chance to develop why can't we develop you have cars as at a rate of you know one car for i don't know is it one car for every american in the world it's four cars for every hundred people why can't we have cars that's unjust that's inequity to not do that that's unequitable for us to not have as many cars and smartphones and gadgets and use as much electricity as you've used that's inequity we're all for equity so there's no way out of any of this there really isn't you know we may have the preachers and the pulpits of politics and the media and the omnipresent news and they've sort of become the daily office and the lectio divina to indoctrinate the faithful in the acts of climate change but if only the faithful are using public transportation or recycling or or or switching to led bulbs or or or doing all these things it's still not going to make a difference the angry god of climate in fact is going to have his way with the sinners and the non-sinners alike so what can you do about this and i just put up on the screen a picture of pat robertson and on the other screen it's we got a little two window two movie thing going here it's gavin newsome and gavin newsome going up to oroville with the smoky backdrop and preaching his little sermon about climate change and pat robertson on the 700 club preaching his little sermon about abortion and you know me i think abortion is wrong i think there should be more restrictions on it climate change i think climate change is real we have to we should be responsible stewards about how we use the planet but in many ways both of these guys are preachers and both of these guys are telling people to do things about what they can't do a lot about and both of it just boils down to well vote for one party or the other because because that'll solve it well republican presidents don't seem to make much difference when it comes to abortion democratic presidents don't seem to make much difference when it comes to climate change oh the moral equivalency and that's usually the thing that then both sides will throw at me i'm just making an observation i'm not telling you who to vote for and vote for whoever you choose i'm just saying this is how these narratives are working it's sort of like going to protestant church now again i am a protestant so i'll pick on the protestants more liberally i use i pick on protestant churches because for the most part protestant churches is about talking you want to convince the people to sin less and live a more righteous life and that seems to be the everybody's a preacher now the governor of california is a preacher the governor of the state of washington is is preaching donald trump was in sacramento preaching the gospel of forest management on and on and on everybody's talk talk talking because we've got to convince our neighbors and again there's absolutely nothing wrong with that it's a completely natural thing for us to do talking is in fact what we should do to all get on the same page to agree about what's right and wrong and to collaborate together and to do things together but now the preaching is coming through news and politicians and well the truth is it's probably always come through them hasn't it what's really interesting to me and i've thought about this for a lot of years is that whether you're in church or watching the news what we're really doing is participating in a symbolic drama and i noted as a preacher that when it comes to total depravity being a calvinist well it's a lovely thing because when you know i had that interview with mr reagan way back before his viral video put him on the map you know he asked me all these questions you know are you conservative i don't really know if i'm like in some ways i am in some ways it depends who i'm standing next to are you are you a racist and i said yes and he stopped why do you say that well i'm a calvinist so i'm all these things i'm a sinner and it feels good to go to church and to confess my sins in theory and in the abstract and it feels good to have my sins atoned for in theory and in the abstract and it's good to be a calvinist to sort of you know use sin all my sins and just get them all done with that once that that gets on to part of why constantine went after christianity because it was a way of no longer having to deal with all the tiny little gods you can just deal with one god is one stop shopping deal with all my sins and if you're on the right or if you're in the right well you feel vindicated and because you're on god's side or god's on your side or there is no god but you're on the right side of history or and all this stuff works exactly the same way in our minds but you can sit there in church and confess your sins but not actually change much and that initiates this whole other narrative and well see the problem with protestants because they believe in you know that god would forgive all their sins and if we if we stopped you know letting protestants imagine that god is is that forgiving well then you know they would feel guilty and they would act more morally depends which moral system is the moral system about abortion over on the right or is the moral system about climate change over on the left is it a god who is looking up in heaven and counting and saying well you elected a republican president more hurricanes more wildfires or you elected a democratic president more hurricanes more wildfires this is not an act of god well this this mic's a little heavy for this stand that i borrowed you might actually spend well you might actually change much you might actually spend money or treat actual women of color or other protected groups poorly you might vote democratic and beat your wife you might vote republican and be the most kindly saintly person towards towards everyone around we've got all those layers too and well how does the climate care about that how does god care about that your participation in the symbolic imaginary however is what gives you and me moral status you might be living exactly like someone else in terms of your carbon footprint my wife my wife decided to download a keto app and so of course i went along with her and started you know i went along with her and started you know putting in my you know the foods that i'm eating and wow there's a lot of carbs in those foods i was before losing weight by limiting carbs so you know i just kind of kill off the main culprits you know not that not eat that big pile of rice or that big baked potato or all that delicious bread or that wonderful bowl of ice cream or that real soda real sugar soda yeah i was doing a good thing and then i put the stuff into that that keto app and i discovered oh my goodness there's carbs and all sorts of things i like to eat and then you know spend a few day trying to eat really low carb diet and it's like wow this is really different and i think if you had an app in terms of well participation in climate change what would that be involved or if you had an app that had participation in abortion participation in a culture of death via abortion let's use language from the other side or the sexualize a the sexualizing of children that that netflix a movie that's that's in all the you know so it's so it's it's again these things are just so funny watching because on one hand everyone was just in gasping about honey boo boo and those and those those little girl beauty pageants which of course are popular in the red state but here you know and the we're having drag queens read storybooks to children in libraries and you know prepubescent books and prepubescent girls twerking on netflix and of course participation in any of this well pat robertson is upset with everyone and god's judgment is on the liberals and conservatives alike in new orleans churches get blown down by hurricanes all the time god's judgment on all of us because of or the climate's judgment on all of us because of all of the things we're doing but at least when we go to church and the pictures here are from the unitarian universalist church of connoisseur wisconsin whose sign was right next to a car lot or a parking lot that got torched it gave great pictures of course its church sign said black lives matter and it got torched by the black lives matter demonstration okay but so i went to google maps and looked at the pictures because churches promote themselves with pictures and they've got the rainbow flag over the pulpit but mostly white people singing songs in sort of a choir well going to going to a blue state church gives you moral status because at least i don't go to one of those churches going to one of the other churches gives you moral status because well at least i'm not like those other sinners on the other side assumption of regard by an all-knowing all-seeing perfect judge so if you're if you've got your climate change app and you're really strupulous about your carbon footprint and and and and well and you decide you're going to stop paying taxes to uncle sam and you're going to be a true radical maybe you're going to be an eco terrorist all of this stuff why do you do it somewhere in your mind you probably imagine an all-knowing all-seeing perfect judge that is smiling on you for all your climate change virtue or if you're the kind who goes out and protests in front of in front of abortion clinics and and is really down for the cause and gives great money well maybe you imagine that god smiles on you for all the good things that you've done and of course if you read jesus he's got two men up went up to the temple to pray one was a Pharisee and thank you lord that i do all these grand things and i'm not like that tax collector over there and of course the tax collector says lord have mercy on me a sinner after we read verse we think well that's what i gotta do i'll pray lord have mercy on me a sinner then i'll have status before god jesus kind of showed us a new trick on and on and on and on but doing these things gives us feelings of meaning now i want to bring in as job calls it a fancy vervecky word it was an idea i first heard in jordan peterson and then john vervecky treated it in his cog sigh awakening from the meaning crisis video exaptation and so i decided to google that and i found a science blog that had a story on exaptation with some dinosaurs on it exaptation how evolution uses what's available i've been listening to a bunch of david slone wilson lately and very interesting very interesting writer very interesting videos from him on youtube very interesting video with god sad that i put on the vander clips channel notice how evolution and david slone wilson does this all the time um how evolution is given is that agency really so blind i mean it's it's the more i study this stuff the the the more obvious the parallels between religion and science become you know how evolution uses what's available so well why if i'm i've got my little climate change app and i'm really working hard on on on reducing my carbon footprint and i'm out there politicking for you know for whatever politician might you know it's just so funny watching this stuff because it wasn't so many months ago at the democratic at the democratic candidates debate that they were all pledging to make climate the number one priority well what's the number one priority now well is it you know racial justice is it climate justice is it well so now we're going to have terms to try and pull all these things in together well this all seems exaptation of religious machinery well where did the religious machinery come from it must have had an adaptive advantage okay well now we're exacting it for for non-religious things so that's we're not going to get away from this stuff must have an adaptive advantage why did this power of social imagination develop in the first place well it's because that's exactly how people can cooperate and collectively get stuff done but you can't say if evolution is blind you might say well that's why it sort of created an adaptive advantage but there's no sense of purpose and meaning behind it like a conscious creature would have right because you've already ruled that out so again i made this little clip of of gad sod and and david sloan wilson's conversation on gad's program the whole conversation was interesting but the part that i clipped out i thought was just super interesting because gad basically says well i'm a purist if it if it's not true i don't i don't go along with it and i thought then why on earth are you talking to human beings because none of this purity that you imagined number one is actually truly possible by a human being and number two you betray it every time you open your mouth in a human enterprise because you have to use all of this imaginary stuff to influence pressure it's it's it's all simply intertwined and david sloan wilson was i think patient and gentle with with gad sad but david sloan wilson basically said this whole idea of symbolic thought and cooperation we're not going to get away from it um wilson's point is similar to brent weinstein's point that there's these two tracks and you can't understand human beings without a deeply communal symbolic imaginary fueling both competition and cooperation and when you look at debates about abortion or debates about climate change it's all about competition and cooperation we are trying to get human beings to cooperate to change laws that have to do with climate policy or abortion policy and it has to do with competition because we are competing against those that are pushing laws the other way and so all of this machinery all of this symbolic machinery is all employed to do this kind of thing and there's no getting around it gad sad can be as pure as he wants to be but he's playing the game you know if you're a purist get out of the game but he can't get out of the game because he's got all these other ideas that that that well there should be justice people shouldn't suffer you don't dig a hole and discover people shouldn't suffer in the material world it's a value and they touched on that but you know in many ways jordan peterson's point that i think that he was trying to make to to sam harris i i feel like jordan peterson because i watch these things and i think you're not understanding how deep this stuff goes we're not escaping it it's not going anywhere it's it's in us and we're not getting rid of it you can't find truth like gad is looking for like you find water it's not the same kind of thing there's a whole bunch of videos that i really want to get to and start playing and do some commenting on i just haven't had time i used to have more time before all of you came into my life but i'm glad you've come into my life and i'm very happy about the changes in my life but i can't do what i used to do anymore so dan bonavac interesting guy teaches at university of texas in austin and he's got a lot of good videos out there and and they're good stuff um the same i forget his name right now the same guy who interviewed me i did an interview on his channel has an interview with dania bonavac which is interesting because is you know again if you've watched through all the gone through all the jordan peterson videos watch son of watch son of bonavac's videos he's not the same as jordan but it's uh there's a lot of good stuff there and he's got this course on 20th century thinkers and he talks a lot about these two level theories and the hermeneutic of suspicion and he's making the point that well a lot of that really developed in the 20th century from the 19th century and i've also been continuing to read um will durrance the story of philosophy which is just a beautiful book and i found the book so helpful it's an audiobook and you can find portions of it on youtube as well but in a sense all of this symbolic imagery is a they're sort of two level theories because we're participating we're participating in these symbolic dramas these symbolic liturgies these symbolic narratives we're we're participating in them all the time and and we even when we don't really quite know what we're doing where two level theories arise in prominence precipitating and reinforcing the meaning crisis for many um i'm sure that there is a me in all of this that's that's sort of the meaning crisis i mean if if in fact it's just my evolutionary biology or or my upbringing or or or that's producing me if i'm simply the sum of the parts and there is no agency well then i have a meaning crisis because i'm certainly not responsible for what i'm doing and any any any manifest image narrative that i participate in is simply fictitious because the scientific narrative is all there is i think if you think through this stuff long enough you see that there's no question that the the scientific narrative is nested within the the manifest narrative because people people can't seem to to act any other way if i'm simply the product of all these forces that i'm not conscious of but then we forget that and we do what we do but we only appropriate what we might learn by scientific learning tools by by imagination and and symbolism look at all the well it's sciency because it's like my car exhaust and then the atmosphere well abortion would have a deep impact on climate change wouldn't it don't you think if we kill more babies and reduce the population then there's less co2 yada yada yada but then you've got the j insulae natural versus unnatural yada yada yada well here's the thing you can't find science like you find water you can't find the number one like you find water we're simply embedded in these systems so deeply there's no getting out of them and and gad sad is is using sort of this modernistic correspondence idea of truth which is a powerful idea and it's a very useful idea but but you can't find truth at the bottom of a of a ditch like you find water either you might find the truth in the ditch but again we're just talking different worlds we can't do correspondence work without imagination and symbols if i'm counting fingers if i count to five one two three four five what we learn in in childhood is that well it's a correspondence thing one two three four five instead of thumb finger finger finger finger it's not five it's thumb finger finger finger finger or it's thing thing thing thing thing or it's you know phalanges or it's it's simply how we work we're just simply so good at these things that we don't see them anymore now now i'll do a little bit of comparing and contrasting between the power of these stories secularity has no hell um fight aside to simply not listen to gavin newsome and simply not believe his narrative of climate change and buy as big a car as i want and burn as much gas as i want and fly over around the country as i want and do as little recycling as i want and be as big a useful consumer as i want and turn up the air conditioning and the heat air conditioning in the summer and the heat in the winter as high as i want and i slip out of this world into the big sleep because there's nothing after death i've gotten away with it oh but will will will will scorn you in future ages i won't know it i'll be nothing right only the living pay the price for past and present climate sins and unjustly only states can inflict the climate justice upon the sinners well so fat chance democracy has so what do we need well you need a you need a climate totalitarian government to impose justice isn't that sort of where these things go is there a link between totalitarianism and having to fix the earth right now and hope of fixing the earth right now and i brought this up in previous videos what's amazing is that many of these narratives that well narratives on both sides obviously but i'll pick on the left right now many of the narratives on the left are simply they simply won't work you're going to have to have a neo-colonialism if you're going to save the world from environmental degradation you're somehow going to maybe use the amazing military might of the united states to bully the rest of the world to adopt policies and and you're going to have climate totalitarian police states enforcing these things oh no we'll we'll do it via technology and free market solutions oh okay well i hope so because again i'm not a skeptic but i look at these systems and i say so actually a story that my friend the chief hydrologist i won't mention his name he's retired he's he's now in his mid-80s but it was many years ago he sat down and of course he always had politically appointed bosses and in fact my um my friend here is a he's a deeply conservative man i'm not going to talk about his stuff here but he's a deeply conservative man politically religiously all the way around he sits down sits down with his boss i think it was the 70s and you know 70s 80s there's these that because you know he's he's in his mid-80s now and he's been doing this job for years he's a very big wheel in california water resources kind of a legend actually he's really a savant but he he sits down with his boss and and they say well there's this thing called climate change and you know looking forward in terms of california water storage we can probably expect less storage from snowpack and which is going to mean we're probably going to need well what build more reservoirs well it's supposed to be tearing down the reservoirs because of environmental concerns well now we're gonna we're gonna store water in valleys that don't have we're gonna store water in valleys that don't have rivers oh okay and there's lots of those in california too but that means you have to pump the water up to it and in order to pump the water up to the valley well now you're gonna use nuclear no we don't talk about nuclear these things just go round and round and round and round and if you can't see the the human beings are on one hand amazingly absurd and amazingly brilliant so we have to pump the water up to these these empty valleys and we're going to use those for reservoirs so we don't disrupt the fish population and hey i don't i care about the fishes um i want to see this i want to see people fishing for salmon in the sacramento river i don't want to see the salmon runs disrupted by dams even though well dams create hydroelectric power that's really energy efficient well we'll offset the the water we store in the dam by well getting hydro when yeah but then you got to pour all that concrete that takes energy that takes money so in other words there's no way around any of these things and i'm not saying there isn't smarter ways to do it and better ways to improve i'm all for that but again how are you going to do this how are you going to make china do it how are you going to make india do it how are you going to make africa do it so isn't that a neo-colonialism but if you're a secular just make sure that it doesn't pinch you oh but i want to have i want to have ex-aptative moral feelings about myself oh okay well then just go to an institution like a church or a or a sierra club or you know give that to the sierra club and live freely i suppose oh i was watching face the nation my my diet of mainstream news has fallen down to almost zero but every now and then i check in and so the governor of of oregon was on and she of course is a a democrat and um again climate change well gov oregon governor calls wildfires are a wake-up call we've had wake-up calls for 20 years and again what what game is being played with this the wake-up calling on both sides so often just seems to harden the other side and that both sides can't see this again just continues to amaze me more than 500 more than 500 000 oregonians are under an evacuation and 40 000 homes have been 40 000 have been forced to leave their homes and i thought i bet you almost all of these people at least in california almost all of these people are white oh some of them are hispanic almost all of these are white many of these people some of these people are wealthy you see them with their ranches and their farm animals many of these people are poor and i was wondering what are they going to say about the race narrative when it comes to the wildfires and so i watched face the nation and oh we got a we got a class narrative i was looking for intersectionality and most of the victims are from underserved communities and i thought okay underserved communities what does that mean well in many ways it's true a lot of rural california is white and poor that's who they are so if they're if they're poor they're underserved if they're white they're privileged and again you start just thinking through these narratives because they're all being thrown at you and and i just think doesn't anyone stop i think more and more people are stopping and saying wait a minute their white privilege isn't saving their homes from the wildfire well for some of them and these people are underserved how well if you're in these rural areas these rural areas are mostly republican voting counties in the state of california well they're certainly underserved because well if you're a republican in the state of california you you're underserved by your by by the state house because you're not going to get any votes through and again the narratives just keep crossing they keep crossing in crazy ways because these many of these communities that are being burned through not especially progressive not especially believing when it comes to climate change when i drive through these countries counties because these are the kinds of places i like to go and when i go on vacation because california is a beautiful state there's all kinds of wilderness and i love wilderness and so there's all these trump signs and pence signs and you know it doesn't it doesn't end but there's this incessant moral drumbeat and it's like can we have an adult moral conversation instead of just all this constant propagandizing it's really a little silly is it climate karma do do do trumpian homes get burned down more than other homes but no it's underserved communities and i think okay well what's the what's the narrative of of equity in terms of service for these communities well we're going to establish government programs that are going to help them and i think okay well who's going to so if you establish a government program to help a poor community again i've been watching this in urban areas all my life so what does the government do well the government has to hire people to to work the program okay well who do they hire to work the program social workers okay so they're going to hire social workers to work the program well you know who who are social workers tend to mostly be a lot of white women a lot of white women with college educations and and and you might have a you might have a hundred million govern hundred million dollar government program to address some niche of of of inequality and poverty and it might be a great niche to address and it might do wonderful things and they might do it better than churches again i'm not i don't intend to initiate all these other narratives i had a noisy street i don't intend to initiate all these other narratives but generally speaking with these programs it's a hundred million dollar program 70 of the program is going to pay the staff which are almost always middle class fairly educated people and then the you know it's it's sort of like a school district sac unified school district had a pause for this noisy car so you spent you look at a school district and look at how much money is paid to the just just just google it you can find it's usually public record sac unified school district how much money is paid to the um the superintendent of the school district look at what the presidents of California public universities make way more than the governor because everybody pays attention to the governor salary but of course the governor is a very wealthy white man when it comes to it but his his moral covering is that of progressive politics and if he makes the right noises well then he's part of the solution and and again i come at this because i've watched these things in religious communities all the time all my life and i feel them as a pastor and so i look at these narratives and i think climate karma Gavin Newsom isn't going to suffer because the wildfires his properties are well insured the wealth these properties are well insured the poor aren't so how are you going to write this in secularity you have to write it in this world and i'm not saying don't try to write it i'm just saying it's never going to happen here and then i flipped the script again and well it's better if there is no god because if there isn't a god then you have to worry about what's on his mind and i hear many times and complaints about religious communities well you know these religious people they're all stricken by guilt and i think really that exaptation hasn't happened on the other side the great post-christian you know relief of guilt really just hasn't paid off because now you don't have to feel guilty about about what having premarital sex or drinking alcohol or smoking or being gay or or not going to church on sunday or not tithing or because there is no god so now you're free to live as you want oh no you're not free to live as you want well maybe you are if you're totally secular but then you're not going to get you're not going to get moral stars or moral acclamations or because you're quite frankly already participating in a symbolic imaginary and your moral status is kind of built in by how you were raised you used to be burdened by guilt about personal morality about sex and language and thoughts and not going to church and and and and i guess a number of years ago that i discovered some of these things and so i started reading everyday feminism every day why can't i get this thing to come up because well everyday feminism navigating masculinity as a black trans man i never straightened out my wrist beyond diversity how to build a truly anti-racist organization practically decolonization how to live it daily taking your anti-racism work to the next level how to take risks and move out of your of your comfort zone reclaiming your pleasure how to live a sexually liberated life in in a sex negative world 160 examples of male privilege in all areas of life well i want to read that one that's the one for me oh beloved readers please give just 12 dollars so that we can maintain our website as a man what does gender equality mean to you i support it because white fairness is a valuable goal equality for equality sake isn't nearly as important as justice for liberation's sake by naming the problem we're not just saying this is wrong so let's fix it because there's no god to fix it instead we're inviting you to consider the impact of gender equality in your life in other words feel some guilt here guilt is healthy you need guilt our job here is to make you feel guilty because by guilt i can now lead you into a more moral life the benefits of which and when you die unless you're spiritual and can have any imaginary you want but we're not really going to let that flourish too much in our neighborhoods because who knows what kind of ideas might go by and these are the important ideas instead we're inviting you to consider the impact of gender inequality in your life and we're encouraging you to make a change for your own sake and for the sake of your community our current cultural expectations legislative session system and social programming work to sustain a hierarchy that constantly places men at the top consequently men consistently achieve succeed and benefit at the expense of other of every other gender that's called male privilege but here's the thing about male privilege it hurts everyone including you this is because accessing male privilege often requires you to conform to toxic norms of masculinity you know this norm it's the idea that only real men are the ones who don't show their emotions which emotions am i allowed to show am i allowed to be angry am i allowed to be violent oh but punching a nazi yes um you know letting your little boys tussle no again it exaptation it's it's all the same it's all the same and you probably also know that no man completely fits his own narrow box of masculinity that our society is unforgiving towards men who don't fit what they're supposed to be and you're not telling me what i'm supposed to be so we have to face the ways traditional masculinity is rewarded with privilege in order to liberate everyone from the painful trap of society's oppressive boxes so you're not trying to um tell me that your new masculinity and to reward me with privilege in order to liberate everyone from the painful trap of i mean and again a lot of you watching this channel you watch benjamin boys i just i just watch it go and now we have the list of social norms and i'm scrolling i'm scrolling i'm scrolling i'm in the 50s i'm in the 60s i'm in the 80s i'm in the 90s i'm in the hundreds i'm i'm still scrolling i'm still scrolling i'm oh religion and lack thereof oh my oh my if you're religious you're more likely to have religious leaders of your gender with every major religion led by men if you're religious well unless you're wiccan huh huh huh if you're religious you're less likely to be assumed incapable of choosing your religion for yourself like when people assume that muslim women need saving you're assuming i need saving if you're religious you're less likely to have your beliefs attributed to irrationality and scientific ineptitude natural for your gender where that natural world came in again if you're religious you're less likely to have your holy text like the bible interpreted in ways that justify mistreating people of your gender like silencing women and less likely to have passages that affirm your gender ignored 162 167 167 so what am i supposed to do here oh boy but there's moral burden on the other side too moral but i mean when i listen to brett weinstein there's moral burden i mean we've got to save politics you know i think it's a little late for um unity 2020 so hey unity 2024 it's never too early to get the movement going and quite frankly i would love us to be more politically moderate i'm a political modern everybody has a politic everybody has political feelings that's that's the nature of the game so your moral burden that's all on you baby and all this brings to mind and you might have heard some intimations of it earlier in the video the book of genesis chapter 18 three visitors visit abraham when the men got up to leave and of course their angels they looked down towards sodom and abraham walked along with them to see them on their way and the lord said the lord in the in the in the representation we'll use that word of one of the angels then the lord said shall i hide from abraham what i'm about to do and i think you know with science i have to do all my own digging this god at least has the courtesy to share something call it revelation dare i okay now of course what was their sin well actually the bible has a great and powerful nation and all the nations of the earth will be blessed through him for i have chosen him so that he will direct his children and his household after me to keep the way of the lord by doing what is right and just so that the lord will bring about for abraham what he promised for him okay that's what's gonna happen with abraham then the lord said the outcry against sodom and okay now of course what was their sin well actually the bible has um in the bible the intimation is well it's kind of marxist in some ways the the sins of sodom and gomorrah were economic they were also religious and see it's all sort of one thing not unlike how religions think about sin but not unlike climate sins it's all sort of one thing it's a it's a big trap you can't escape from that's you know that's when i read these things and i'm of course experienced now living and working in a religious context maybe i just see religion everywhere but the cry out cry against sodom and gomorrah is so great and their sin so grievous that i have to i will go down and see if what they are doing is as bad as the outcry that has reached me if not i will know so god in all fairness is gonna come down take a closer look give them their chance and in fact allow abraham a chance to weigh in the men turned away and went towards sodom but abraham remained standing before the lord now i got tipped off to this from tim keller because and in fact in the current niv there's a little footnote the old testament comes in the masoretic text which is the hebru text then there's a septuagint was translated about the first century bc a lot of debate about this passage because the masoretic text has well generally speaking the inferior stands before the superior so abraham would stand before the lord that's sort of the proper way to say it but the masoretic text has it reversed almost all contemporary translations i looked through a whole bunch of them before making this videos all has it like the niv has i assume i didn't check the septuagint probably the septuagint has it this way because it hackles religious propriety sensitivities to have the lord standing before abraham because that would make the lord an inferior and abraham the superior but in a sense that fits this narrative here because abraham is about to take the righteous position and and and but not really because you'll notice later on as i read it well i'll just read the text when abraham approached him and said will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked if there are 50 righteous people in the city will you really sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of 50 righteous people in it what's he saying well if there's i don't know what's the population of the city of new orleans this is a problem when i don't do my research let's say say a million people in the city of new orleans how many of those million people had abortions i don't know abortions over what time frame let's say a few thousand will you sweep away a million people because a few thousand women had abortions no it's because of the culture of the city fair enough it's because of the laws of the city fair enough both the climate change people and the abortion people well they understand that idea they both get that idea no america is in judgment because of abortion fair enough america is in judgment because of climate karma fair enough it's it's god or it's climate change fair enough we sweep away the righteous with the unrighteous the the women who got abortions the the men who allowed it the doctors who performed the people who who who who in new orleans that probably voted democratic or louisiana that probably voted republican will you sweep away the people of alabama and mississippi and arkansas who are you know trying to be as against abortion as possible hey they're doing it because they're trying to stop the hurricanes come on give those people a break just like the people of washington are trying to stop climate change are you going to do that are you going to sweep them away lord oh no you can't talk to the climate can you talk to god is it valuable to talk to god will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked what if there are 50 people in the city will you really sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of 50 righteous people in it far be it from you to do such a thing to kill the righteous with the wicked treating the righteous and the and the wicked alike far be it from you will not the judge of all the earth do rightly because if the judge of all the earth doesn't do rightly what hope do we have can you talk to the climate this way the lord said if i find 50 righteous people in the city of sodom he hasn't even gone to investigate yet if i find 50 righteous people i will spare the whole place for their sake how many people in the city of sodom then i don't know i'm just thinking about some of the things that i know about that period of time a few hundred thousand maybe big city a few thousand not a lot 50 still just a portion abraham spoke up again this is where he's now that i have been so bold as to speak to the lord though i am nothing but dust and ashes what if the whole number of righteous was less five less than 50 will you destroy the whole city for a lack of five people if i find 45 there i say i will not destroy it and down and down and down of course he goes and abraham won't go down too and of course then the story happens and in the story well how do we know whether or not they're righteous well the whole hospitality scene so people on one side will say oh it's about penises and buttholes other people say no it's about hospitality okay well penises and buttholes does that not matter hospitality does that not matter one way or another righteous or gibia you look at the end of the book of judges same story same story is the book of sodom the end of book of judges with gibia gibia is the town that saul is from we pay attention to the bible you know it's a very complex book the bible is having these kinds of conversations well well well what does this mean well does as god come down and said paul i'm going to destroy california and the whole west coast with wildfires why well because of because of your climate sins oh because of your racial sins oh well well isn't california supposed to be less racist well i don't know how do we measure racism isn't california supposed to be less have fewer climate sins than texas i don't know how can we measure the climate sins how about me and my personal sin this stuff is really hard i say well lord far be from you to sweep away the just with the unjust um if there are a million climately righteous people in california or well let's do abortion if there are a million republican voters and in the state of california and there's way more than a million will you bring the wildfires and the bad air now again you might listen to this and say it's all just chaos you can't live that way either which way you're going to live and of course if you multiply the scope to the world can our system afford this amount of nuance with justice the poor pay for the climate sins of the wealthy you're not going to get away from it and the wealthy die they get away with it the young pay for the climate sins of the old your climate guilt does nothing for anyone feel as guilty as you want about it politic as much as you want about it if you don't do it in a savvy way that actually gets results towards your goal but you're never going to get to that goal how are you going to stop china and india in the middle east and africa and and all the rest of the world that's producing all that co2 threaten them with nuclear weapons maybe that would do it nuclear power well we don't want to do that we're not going to solve these things well maybe they're unsolvable and they can't be solved we should throw up our hands well that doesn't seem right either we've actually been able to solve many things by working together on them if you die before the consequence you got away with it your guilt matters for nothing do we have a point to this well it's along the lines of the symbolism the exaptation we use this machinery on both sides of the political aisle we use this machinery the religious use it the irreligious use it the real difference tends to be well do you have any hope for the future well what do you mean by hope well that gets complex too what are these systems that we're using why is this so symbolic so again i maybe i'll dive more into the gad sad video because david slone makes a a crucial point here he says you know we're all working these things with symbolism and so the symbolism matters and the conversations do matter and the exaptation does matter and you know i think very few people would say yeah we need more abortions very few people would say now we should do whatever the heck we want with the climate pollute all we want if you actually live next to a polluter you probably don't want it you might like going out into nature and finding the natural part clean and pure and not covered with smoke and the levels of wild wildfires well alarming all of us none of us at california are enjoying the bad air we you know our our way out of covid was being outside and now that's our way into lung cancer so we're going to use symbolism we're going to talk about these things seems to me it's reasonable to try to make progress on abortion seems reasonable progress on abortion means reduce the abortion rates what's the best way to do it i'm not really sure i'm not a politician but it seems that people who say oh women should have a say well generally speaking women should have a say all that fetus has rights that fetus should have rights let's figure out how to talk about this unwanted pregnancies let's reduce them yeah well how should we well let's talk about that you know protestants and catholics might disagree on some of those okay let's talk about it well climate change and and forest management yeah we could probably do better in forest management well what about co2 well we're not all in agreement on co2 but most of us can agree that well let's let's find ways to work on these things well your your your moderate attitude won't really give us the change we need okay how totalitarian do you want to get with this and can you actually maintain your totalitarian climate views and your totalitarian sexual views no no it's you conservatives that are the sexual totalitarians really i just read a thing telling i just read a thing telling me how to be a man was it written by a man i don't know it sounded a little totalitarian to me i think there are what do you count the old testament law there's 600 some odd laws we already had 165 about my toxics masculinity we're just getting started so yeah let's acknowledge well there's some exaptation going on we're going to be using this symbolic thought for cooperation and so maybe get off some of the high horses about i only believe in science well then once you opened up your mouth you sort of betrayed it because if you're trying to convince me in order to play a political game you're involved in something that is science can talk about it and david slone wilson and his science i think does talk about it but there's a lot of religious stuff going on in all of this too so i don't know this video is worthwhile maybe i just wasted my time i often have that feeling when i get to the end of a video but i'll post it we'll see how the sound is we'll see what you think
