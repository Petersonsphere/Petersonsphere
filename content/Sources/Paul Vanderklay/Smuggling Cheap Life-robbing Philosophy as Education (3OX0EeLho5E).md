 Hi, this is Paul and this is part two of chapter one of the abolition of man and in my last video I reached into the new Daniel Dennett Keith Ward conversation and I made the point that both authors are both are trying to figure out okay meaning, where is meaning, what kind of a thing is meaning and again for Jordan Peterson this is the work that he's been doing forever or where can we locate this meaning and so in a sense when Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris are talking about is there meaning in the glass that Elton John drank from or meaning in the guitar that Elvis played or meaning in the land that they're fighting over in the Middle East well one of the issues that you get into very quickly is we experience meaning as a feeling but very quickly in a reductionist system all meaning is is a feeling and so when I go and see a waterfall I will I I have a I I feel that well what I sublime means what I feel sublime no I feel humble I feel and and what I've been arguing for is that there's beauty out there that we are built to apprehend and that is built into the system and not only beauty but good and evil and meaning that this is all part of it but but the difficulty that you're having is that is this simply a feeling because if you say it's a feeling then you're pretty much just left open to relativism and what that means is relativism says well if I feel meaning committing genocide that's just as good as you feeling meaning stopping my genocide because all we're left with are two people feeling meanings now actually in the in the second Vancouver debate this gets brought into this part of the conversation so I'm going to play some of that we have we're wired to feel intense empathy for individuals who are close to us and we can be told stories in a manner that that makes that system manifest itself okay so we're told stories that makes us feel empathy but now again what we do when we say this is we forget the larger frame well why do you want to tell stories and they just had this conversate conversation where if you if you show one child on TV everyone will want to sponsor that child we saw this in the Dominican Republic if you show two children on TV the empathy level goes if you say a thousand children are in danger of starvation you'll actually get less money and Sam Harris is saying well this is a bug in our wiring okay why do you think it's a bug because you have a standard that says well if a thousand children are suffering that's worse than one child suffering again now get into the equality what is this progressive um what what is this what is this progressive epicureanism value what is its goal its goal is well um its goal is feeling equality so so all of us should have the same feelings and meaning is a feeling and well-being is a feeling and and if we see something beautiful we get a feeling but it's all about the feelings it's all about what's in here and and the question is is there something out there is there moral value and and CS Lewis asked the question are there predicates of value can they exist that's the question in the in the first bit of the first chapter of of the abolition of man can we use predicates of value in terms of is there value out there and is it the case that there's value out there and we are built just like with our eyes we're built to see things on certain wavelengths and we're built to compute that are we built to see and feel and touch and taste meaning and then act on this so that we in fact when we see the suffering child respond with generosity that would be that's the traditional understanding of the system that there is a moral problem out there that's independent of my feelings to which I must respond and this is what they're trying to sort through the three of them here and everyone and their dog thinks that that's a wonderful thing and we call that empathy their dog doesn't think it's a wonderful thing I understand the turn of phrase but that's critical right and empathy has a narrow domain of utility as it turns out because how I mean maybe if you were all and Peterson has reduced it to the feeling because this is in our culture the cultural conversation is well everyone should feel empathy okay I don't have a problem with the empathy word but where you why are you using the should word show me where your should comes from in that well we all know okay yeah I agree with you but your your your instincts are better than the system you imagine it's built on who you should be you'd be weeping constantly for the catastrophic fate of sentient beings on the earth but you can't handle it you know what I mean it's that you can barely handle your own suffering and maybe you can handle a bit of the suffering of your family and more power to you if you could rectify that and if you were better human beings maybe you could expand that outwards the fact that our empathy doesn't scale up to the level of genocide with the same intensity that we treat instances of individual suffering isn't an indication that we're irrational it's just an indication that we're limited well I think this is an indication of exactly the problem of our evolved structures not matching the present because the point is well they do match because we take care of our families no but they don't match because if you in now what's interesting again is our evolved structures don't match the present well how don't they match well well again is meaning is is the is the ought to help the suffering children is that simply a function of my feelings because well cold-hearted people can look at that and say I don't know those children anything enemies or rivals could look at that and say I'm glad their children are suffering okay where does that ought where does that should where do all these three men on the stage agree that empathy is something we should feel that corresponds to something out there and they're trying to figure that out that's what they're doing now oh no did I close it no I didn't okay let's pick up let's pick this up and and here you know Gaius and Titius while teaching him nothing about letters have cut out his soul well what does that mean what is Louis saying well yes you should share you should care for that suffering child not only the one but the thousand but the thousand well why well yes that's the question why and and in past generations this our chest our heart our feelings not just our guts not just our head but our heart we assume has been oriented to something out there in the universe that is true and real in fact it's so real we will die for it and and those who die for it we esteem in other words when we have labor day or memorial day and we pay listen to the language this is we pay honor to those who have given their life for us what have we just done this is just about the feeling or do we say that some transaction happened well here's the question can your philosophical tradition account for that transaction and what Louis is saying is that subtly in the language we're destroying it and we're destroying it because we're saying it's just a feeling little book whose author I will call or bilious I find that the same operation under the same general anesthetic is being carried out or bilious now Louis again under the anesthetic what does that mean it means that these very bad English teachers who are in fact ignoring what is supposed to what they're supposed to be doing by teaching them English by showing how the poor writing in this advertisement is in fact poor writing and Louis says you can line this up next to good writing and see these the the advertisement is terrible writing but they're not interested in that at all what are they interested in they're interested in smuggling their philosophy under the text and and the teachers might not know it the students don't know it and what you're doing is the crowd is building up all the elephants under the riders are building up suspicion that you know what it's just feelings when I when I feel empathy it doesn't mean that I should care for that village of suffering children not just triggering my my mirror neurons when I see a suffering child on tv you see what what what Weinstein and Peterson and Harris are actually struggling with is the biology and and it's not actually the system that's the problem it's it's the reduction to biology because biology says I see the face of one suffering child and my heart goes out okay that's just the biology I hear about a thousand children suffering I hear about the children of my enemies suffering and I ought to do something that's not biology those are value predicates those are this thing this meaning this beauty this this real world out there that is far more than information as Daniel Dennett says this is in fact what we live for it's in fact what human beings have always lived for Obelius chooses for debunking a silly bit of writing on horses where these animals are praised as the willing servants of the early colonists in Australia and he falls into the same trap as Gaius and Titius of ruck and slipped near and the weeping horses of Achilles and the war horse in the book of Job may even have rare rabbit and of peter rabbit man's prehistoric piety to our brother the ox of all that this semi-anthropomorphic treatment of beasts has meant in human history and of the literature where it finds noble or piquant expression he has not a word to say even of the problems of animal psychology as they exist for science he says nothing he contents himself with explaining that horses are not secondum litteram okay now remember all of these all of these latinisms are are on the website and you can pull them up they are not the the discussion of secondum litteram express expressions refer to expressions that are not literally true and that's what we're talking about because Harris wants to talk well we want to reduce the world to that which is literally true and and that's now the that's now the test that we're going to apply to everything and this is the modernist this is the modernist fundamentalist split where the the assumption comes underneath the radar that the only truth is the literal truth so what about these horses well you know what they're just horses but what does that mean what does it justify when we decide that they are just horses because pretty quickly human beings are going to be just trousered apes secondum litteram interested in colonial expansion in colonial expansion this piece of information is really all that his pupils get from him why the composition before them is bad when others that lie open to the same charge are good they do not hear much less do they learn of the two classes of men who are respectively above and below the danger of such writing the man who really knows horses and really loves them not with anthropomorphic illusions but with ordinate love okay now he's that's that's Augustine's key thing ordinate love but what he's saying is just like he said with the with the patriotism in the previous video is that this this slippage that happens two people are there's people who are both above and below what's happening here the people above it the true patriot knows it's a noble thing to die for your country well why is it a noble thing well they can't answer that well and then you're going to go into all kinds of and actually all kinds of arguments like matt della hunty goes into oh because my ancestors figured out was a noble thing so that idea just kind of got passed down to me through dna wow that dna can sure carry a lot of things including ideas huh well how does that work so that's one reduction and so the patriot knows well the patriot has a heart he has a chest the person underneath it just debunks everything and they're just in it for themselves ordinate love and the irredeemable urban blockhead to whom a horse is merely an old-fashioned means of transport some pleasure in their own ponies and dogs they will have lost some incentive to cruelty or neglect they will have received some pleasure in their own knowingness will have entered their minds that is their day's lesson in english though of english they have learned nothing another little portion of the human heritage has been quietly taken from them before they were old enough to understand and again my point about cultures a good culture or good parents allow for children to behave with wisdom they have not in their life had time to acquire this is what human beings do and how they bless successive generations and as louis says what's the the philosophical smuggling going on in these works are robbing future generations actually not only of what they might enjoy but what they will need i have hitherto been assuming that such teachers as guayas and tissues do not fully realize what they're doing and do not intend the far-reaching consequences it will actually have there is of course another possibility what i have called presuming on their concurrence in a certain traditional system of values the trousered ape and the urban blockhead may be precisely the kind of man they really wish to produce the differences between us may go all the way down they may really hold that the ordinary human feelings about the past or animals or large waterfalls are contrary to reason and contemptible and ought to be eradicated that's pretty much what sam harris how he diagnoses the middle eastern conflict oh they're just fighting about land the world would be better if they just fight about land jordan peterson jumps in and says hey wait a minute it's also about family because this route goes down not just to connections with land or connection with with with little cookie tins because a friend of mine sent me a gift from the netherlands it goes all the way down to the love of our children and our ability to sacrifice for them and as peterson and weinstein and harris get into it also goes into the question of okay so maybe there's a biological reason well i will go in and get my own child out but what is the reason that i will risk my life for the sake of a stranger's child or a stranger or in fact an enemy that's the question yeah the mirror neuron with the with the weeping girl who's starving on tv yeah i can understand how that works that's biology but to care for the child of my enemy that i ought to do so where does that come from in a world where we know that that female chimps will kill the young offspring of rival females within their own troop if they get the chance that's our biology but now we imagine we ought to transcend and get to a better place of what is this better place you speak of unless there is actually meaning and beauty and we can actually use predicates of value well we might want a philosophical system that can actually afford them they may be intending to make a clean sweep of traditional values and start with a new set that position will be discussed later if it is the position which gaius and tishus are holding i must for the moment content myself with pointing out that it is a philosophical and not a literary position in filling their book with it they have been unjust to the parent or headmaster who buys it and who has got the work of amateur philosophers where he expected the work of professional grammarians a man would be annoyed if his son returned from the dentist with his teeth untouched and his head crammed with the dentist's obiter dicta obiter dicta louis is so funny obiter dicta a thing said incidentally an unofficial an unofficial expression of opinion in other words what louis is saying is that gaius and tishus they're just filling the minds of their students cutting out their chests just on incidentally and and actually well they may be intending to do much more obiter dicta on bimetallism or the baconian theory but i doubt whether gaius and tishus have really planned under cover of teaching english to propagate their philosophy i think they have slipped into it for the following reasons in the first place literary criticism is difficult and what they actually do is very much easier and and that's exactly right it's it's easy well what are they doing they're simply propagating their philosophy they are passing along the things that have come under the radar from the other elements they and in fact most of what we do with each other comes in at this level this is how we communicate and this in fact is exactly what i should i should pull up that video this is the video it's dallas willard the nature and necessity of world views from the very task form and here he gets into it it's terrific video briefly the sociological side of the aspect of worldview because the truth of the matter is we have those two areas to deal with and the person who is absolutely convinced of the things that koon has said can still be embarrassed at being thought unscientific whereas if they really absorbed what he had to say and were really concerned about truth and research and all that sort of thing they would say well you know that's no different from being thought unrepublican or something of that sort that's that's sociological thing this these are the tribes that we have and it's very deep within the elephant to stay in that tribe and so you see what we're dealing with here is the power of worldview and i want to try to make as clear as possible what this is and talk about how it works in our context so you'll be following along up here and i think all of you have a sheet to make some notes on just in case uh you need to write something down i will enlarge a little bit on this but let's just begin with the idea of worldview basic idea of worldview as you see here is your worldview consists of your assumptions about the realities and values that govern you and the world in which you live now let me illustrate it how many of you here tonight worried that coming to this meeting you would be eaten by a dinosaur may i see your hands oh we got one over here i think he's faking willard's a pretty corny guy see that that reflects your worldview that dinosaurs aren't there or to mention another reference to steve weinberg i've heard him say for example that when he goes to do his research he doesn't worry about fairies he says well you know there might it's logically possible but he doesn't worry about well that's his worldview see his worldview is basically your assumptions now you see they're not being any dinosaurs on the ucla campus is a part of your worldview even though you didn't think about it and this is exactly the in a sense the time bomb that or the the leeching of the idea that these english professors are putting in the textbooks that's an important thing to understand about worldviews is that you don't have to think about them in order for them to determine your behavior now we we need to just sort of let that soak in because you can't live without a worldview and that's why i say on the screen here a world when you get into jordan peterson and sam harris and these conversations this is this a priori filthy filter it's a biological reality it's built into your usual actions and responses view is a biological reality that is to say it's built right into your life it's built into your body your body responds in terms of your worldview whether you think about it or not right and so your worldview is most clearly seen in the things you don't think about and talk about and partly because you know if you have to think about and talk about all the stuff that determines your actions you're dead you can't get across the street this is what jordan peterson was saying this is 2006 he's talking that's what that we're made to be biological units and live in a in a world with a kind of unified 360 degree orientation 360 degree orientation which very often is far removed from our conscious thinking and this is where we get into well atheists who believe in god and god believers who live like atheists it's it's our worldview it's packed into us and that's the picture of the person who doesn't want to i mean if someone we have philosophers for example who if they thought that someone they respected thought they were unscientific they wouldn't sleep at night they'd sit up and worry about it even though as dr coons has shown they're shown there really is no unified consistent picture of what it means to be scientific in general a physicist yes a chemist yes a physiologist stretch it a little bit an economist that's you know sociologist you won't get all the way over to english literature with that one but still i mean there is a solid meaning to science as long as you're talking about a particular science and scientists when they're about their work as a physicist or whatever they don't generally worry about worldviews but they still have one and then we carry one as academic people we kind of carry a rather ragtag unexamined set of assumptions about the world and often we pound them off on science since it's just after easter i remember a few years ago one of my a very very bright young man a philosophy major and and an outstanding christian was walking along with one of our professors from the religion department and this young man brought up the issue the resurrection of christ and the professor said well of course that couldn't have happened because that would be contrary to the laws of physics now this young man he wasn't in a position to say well now professor which law was that would you just help me work work through that with me see so that but that's a part of that professor's worldview and it's totally groundless i mean some interesting connection could be made i mean some interesting connection could be made i don't mean to deny that but to just say well it's contrary to the laws of physics well which one right and now regularly in teaching courses in philosophy i will have to challenge my students just to help them out with this to say now go to your chemistry professor and ask him for a reference to a refereed journal that shows that people do not survive the death of their brain now of course they don't do it because they'd be scared to death to do it you see there isn't any technical journal in chemistry that proves or even attempts to prove that people do not survive the death of their brain you can't get an engagement with the issue because you have a worldview now you know our work is about knowledge and that's the second screen you have there and want to talk a little bit about knowledge and truth and the university is supposed to be about knowledge that's what you're here doing your work i don't know whether you're undergraduate or graduate or whatever but you're trying to gain knowledge and one might say that that is what the university is about is the gaining of knowledge and one might also think that knowledge involves truth and that you cannot know what isn't true but you see that one of the ironies about our veritas forum is uh uh veritas is it's kind of nice to put it in latin you know i don't know how it would work if we had a truth forum and the fact is that truth is in trouble now not just religious or moral truth but truth and it's a little embarrassing and you know we need to think deeply about that i quote here a sentence from the wasp that stands for western association of schools and colleges they're the people that come around and decide whether or not your degree is any good and i occasionally serve on these site committees some of you probably do the same faculty here faculty here and here's what they say an institution of higher education is by definition dedicated to the search for truth and its dissemination now harvard actually had a little problem with this through the years in deciding what to do with truth and they've changed their shield a number of times um primarily they were troubled about the issue of the unity of truth and uh that is does does truth include the religious the moral and the other dimensions of truth and gradually through the years there has been a kind of de facto drift in university affairs that relegates truth to just the natural world shall we say and so then our ability to represent god a personal character of the human being spiritual side all of that is eliminated from knowledge but truth itself does not do that i mean i've given here a statement of what a truth is a thought or statement is true if it is if what it is about is as that thought or statement represents it so have you got a quarter in your pocket and say well yes i've got a quarter in my pocket well that statement will be true if indeed your pocket has a quarter in it right how can you get more elemental than that but that's the general nature of truth and truth is involved in knowledge because knowledge is our capacity to represent things as they are on an appropriate basis of thought and experience and that can include authority nearly everything we know is known on the basis of authority do you know that the playoffs have now begun in the nba well some of you i think didn't know that well take my word for it it has and so that's the general character of knowledge and truth and and we do need to reflect on that we need to understand that truth does not accommodate belief belief has to accommodate truth no one has ever made a no one has ever made a proposition true simply by believing it now maybe their belief in it caused them to act and to bring something about that made the proposition true but merely believing doesn't make propositions true a group of people believing it doesn't help get up a movement get a grant it won't make it true right a million frenchmen have been wrong a million americans have been wrong so the bitterness of truth is its total indifference to human will and desire together with the fact that human desire and will is set on reshaping the truth this is the fundamental conflict in human life is the conflict between desire or will and truth and that conflict affects everything we do including what we do on the university campus so uh now uh when it comes to these worldview questions you see the same issue of truth is there and the question of how do we know the truth still applies to those not just about whether in your pocket but for example whether you're going to continue conscious existence when your brain is no longer functioning right that's that's a good a good question of fact and uh now how we settle that that's a difficult thing to argue about but if it is true then it's true regardless of what you are i may think about it i often shock my students we're discussing dacart or someone i ask them what if it turns out you can't stop existing well i mean there you have hamlet's problem don't you he wasn't sure he could make an end of himself with a bare bodkin to sleep perchance to dream i there's the rub right so now here's a question of fact or truth and it has incredible bearings on how we approach our life am i fundamentally a material object that exists gets organized by dna and exists for a little while and then i stop existing or am i an unceasing spiritual being with an eternal destiny in god's universe wow what a difference see now the main world worldview questions we can go on to slide five basically you can boil them down to three you can add a couple more and this will get into a fair amount of of willard stuff i i really wanted to get to the point i haven't watched this video in a while where he talks about how world views are translated and enables us to negotiate and ship to it i often de pleasant experience thinking it's not then uh is a human being go back to the case i'm using to illustrate is are they just a physical organism and i don't think major questions of course students at ucli because they have a bright future right and that's like usc we promise everyone they're going to be successful but this is this is a profound question who is well off and can you still be well off if you have cancer or if you don't get your phd or you don't have enough money to go on and get your ba degree can you still be well off who is well off and that is a profound world view question that reflects itself in nearly everything that we do uh who is a really good person that's another big one actually people are more concerned about that one than they are about who's well off you can get a get a fight out of someone by questioning whether they're a really good person much quicker than you can by questioning whether they're well off you know you know you must not be well off you don't drive alexis they'll look at you and shrug but i can give you some other language that they will fight you very quickly you see so that and that's one of the deep questions am i a good person it's one of the deepest world view questions that human beings deal with they're constantly concerned about it if you have any doubts about it your blood pressure will immediately go up and why is that right i mean try it i am a stinker blood pressure goes up right or even joe thinks i'm a stinker right blood pressure goes up and this is these are these are really pervasive questions that trouble us all the time well let me hasten on i mean now the truth of the matter is we could list others like how do you get to be a good person that's a good one questions about what counts as knowledge is very big on the campus see those are world view questions they organize our lives as a whole now what i want to say is that all teaching institutions great teachers even little teachers give answers to these questions they get snuck in okay who is the good person the good person says that there's no such thing as value out there it's just feelings that gets transmitted to students they all figure who's good and who's not who's considered smart who's considered you know on point and i mentioned here jesus because he's one of the most obvious people to mention there never has been anyone who has been more influential in his teaching about these things than jesus but of course he's not the only one playto the buddha freud and ucla ucla answers these questions they convey an impression of the truth of a certain world view in the university setting the dominating world view is expressed through what is accepted as research and what counts as possible knowledge i ask you about the dinosaur and whether or not any of you thought about being eaten by one on the way here tonight no well let me give you another one is there a single course of studies on this campus and i don't you know i'm just picking on you because that's where we are i go usc berkeley or wherever it is all the same is there a single course of studies on this campus that you're engaged in that regards knowledge of god as a part of the subject matter a single one where you might be a part of your expertise in that field or your grade might be determined by something you had to say about god you see that's the sociological reality what dr kuhn said is so cogent and so forceful and when you and they didn't record what dr kuhn said which was a huge pity no you understand what he said you just read the book and you understand what he said you just wonder how can people not understand not understand this but the truth of the matter is people who are caught up in the sociological wave will hear it all and dismiss it because to them it's just like the dinosaur are and what i want to do to do this evening especially is to just take the time to insist that you are in a system which teaches a worldview without responsibly defending it it how is a worldview taught well mainly it's taught by body language facial expressions tones of voice and inflections looks offhand remarks about people and events by what is permissible by example how we treat people in class out of class colleagues by who gets rewarded or punished in various ways in the academic or other context almost never is worldview taught by explicit statement it is modeled it is by what we do it is by how we act it is by the status hierarchies that we create that is how worldview is taught in church in university in the family in your neighborhood on the street everywhere explicit tape statement is usually usually happens only to reinforce what is taught indirectly in the ways just indicated above and you can watch willard but this is exactly lucas point about gaius and ticious to explain why a bad treatment of some bad treatment of some basic human emotion is bad literature is if we exclude all question begging attacks on the emotion itself a very hard thing to do even dr richards who first seriously tackled the problem of badness in literature failed i think to do it to debunk the emotion on the basis of a commonplace rationalism is within almost anyone's capacity in the second place i think guys and tissues may have honestly misunderstood the pressing educational need of the moment they see the world around them swayed by emotional propaganda they have learned from tradition that youth is sentimental and they conclude that the best thing they can do is to fortify the minds of young people against emotion and this is not far from sam harris well these these christians out there they have these emotions they have these ideas they're they're doing these things we need to get rid of these emotions and we need to be rational now science seems to have moved on beyond mr spock imagining that if we are emotionless we will be rational now we're more sophisticated now we've learned something here but this hasn't changed so much emotion my own experience as a teacher tells an opposite tale for every one pupil who needs to be guarded from a weak excess of sensibility there are three who need to be awakened from the slumber of cold vulgarity the task of the modern educator is not to cut down jungles but to irrigate deserts the right defense against false sentiments is to inculcate just sentiments by starving the sensibility of our pupils we only make them easier prey to the propagandist when he comes for because remember louis is saying there's actually predicates of value out there meaning is out there beauty is out there courage is out there it exists out in the world and what we need to do is educate people to live up to it to be courageous to know the truth to understand the good and as dallas willard says well universities have given up on that except now what has changed between 2006 and 2018 in terms of the university is now a new religion has come in which is saying this is what's good ah but shall we examine this oh no no no there must not be any examination well that's exactly the problem because the problem with high religious hierarchies as sam harris clearly says they're not subject to examination but now we have a new religious hierarchy only they don't call themselves religious this is just justice and goodness and fairness but do not examine what's underneath it you may not do that well that's an old religious trick and that's why i as a religious person watch this and think i know these tricks i've seen them my whole life long religious people have all played these tricks no let's use reason let's talk let's examine for famished nature will be avenged and a hard heart is no infallible protection against a soft head but there is a third and a profounder reason for the procedure which gaius and tishus adopt they may be perfectly ready to admit that a good education should build some sentiments while destroying others they may endeavor to do so but it is impossible that they should succeed do what they will it is the debunking side of their work and this side alone which will really tell in order to grasp this necessity clearly i must digress for a moment to show that what may be called the educational predicament of gaius and tishus is different from that of all their predecessors until quite modern times all teachers and even all men believed the universe to be such that certain emotional reactions on our part could be either congruous or incongruous to it and believed in fact that objects did not merely receive but could merit our approval or disapproval our reverence or our contempt the reason why coleridge agreed with a tourist who called the cataract sublime and disagreed with the one who called it pretty was of course that he believed inanimate nature to be such that certain responses could be more just or ordinate or appropriate to it than others and he believed correctly that the tourists thought the same the man who called the cataract sublime was not intending simply to describe his own emotions about it he was also claiming that the object was one which merited those emotions but for this claim there would be nothing to agree or disagree about to disagree with this is pretty if those words simply described the lady's feelings would be absurd if she had said i feel sick coleridge would hardly have replied no i feel quite well when shelly having compared the human sensibility to an aeolian liar goes on to add that it differs from a liar in having a power of internal adjustment whereby it can accommodate its courts to the motions of that which strikes them he is assuming the same belief can you be righteous asks trahurn unless you be just in rendering to things their due esteem all things were made to be yours and you were made to prize them according to their value again what's he talking about he's saying everyone in the world up until this point it seems have had the assumption that there is goodness that there is value that that when the man bursts into the home to to save the child of his enemy that this is an act to be valued and held up as noble that this is an example of something out there that exists that that action corresponds to something that we might say well he would go in for his own child because that's mere biology but there's something beyond biology that we strive to live up to and you'll hear harris or weinstein both assume that this is built in to the world and when we say we have to transcend our chimpanzee morality that's what they're talking about and it is trans cultural it is trans religious c.s louis is going to call it the dow but we're not there yet their value said augustin defines virtue as ordo amoris ordered love amoris the ordinate condition of the affections in which every object is accorded that kind of degree of love which is appropriate to it now one of the things that you might pay attention to during the harris the jordan peterson harris thing is how little love comes up see augustin turns that on its head and says no this is actually all about love because what we do is about what we desire and so if you really want to get to that level you have to talk about desires not just these abstractions appropriate to it adestockel says that the aim of education is to make the pupil like and dislike what he ought when the age for reflective thought comes the pupil who has been thus trained in ordinate affections or just sentiments will easily find the first principles in ethics but to the corrupt man they will never be visible at all and he can make no progress in that science play to before him had said the same the little human animal will not at first have the right responses it must be trained to feel pleasure liking disgust and hatred at those things which really are pleasant likable disgusting and hateful in the republic the well-nurtured youth is one who would see most clearly whatever was amiss in ill-made works of man or ill-grown works of nature and with a just distaste would blame and hate the ugly even from his earliest years and would give delighted praise to beauty receiving it into his soul and being nourished by it so that he becomes a man of gentle heart notice receiving beauty into his soul beauty is a thing out there that we apprehend and can in fact receive and and when it comes to some of these other values our lives should mirror the values that exist out there that's what we're talking about all this before he is of an age to reason so that when reason at length comes to him then bread as he has been notice again if you're looking at the video before he's the age of reason lowercase r so that when reason uppercase r why does louis go the uppercase because again if you go back to miracles reason is something that comes from above reason is a gift to humanity sort of like in mythology fire louis you think well sam harris is all about louis and or sam harris is all about reason and not louis louis's reason mops up sam harris and bread as he has been he will hold out his hands in welcome and recognize her because of the affinity he bears to her in early hinduism that conduct in men which can be called good consists in conformity too or almost participation in the rita go back and listen to what sam harris has to say about good and evil and hinduism before louis became a christian he seriously contemplated becoming a hindu he knew hinduism well and and basically what louis is pointing to which almost any classicist will point to is that for the most part the majority position is that it is the moral duty of the individual to conform themselves to the larger structure that exists that's pretty cross-cultural the rita that great ritual or pattern of nature and supernature which is revealed alike in the cosmic order the moral virtues and the ceremonial of the temple righteousness correctness order the rita is constantly identified with satya or truth correspondence to reality as plato said that the good was beyond existence and wordsworth that through virtue the stars were strong so the indian masters say that the gods themselves are born of the rita and obey it the chinese also speak of a great thing the greatest thing called the dao it is the reality beyond all predicates the abyss that was before the creator himself it is nature it is the way the road it is the way in which the universe goes on the way in which things everlastingly emerge stillly and tranquilly into space and time it is also the way which every man should tread in imitation of that cosmic and super cosmic progression conforming all activities to that great exemplar in rituals say the analex it is harmony with nature that is prized the ancient jews likewise praised the law as being true okay now a note to some christians because you will find if you google this book on the internet you will find christians taking shots at it the dao is not god for lewis if you want to look at it in biblical terms it's the law now read the psalms about the law and and read the old testament about the law now then you're also going to have to read the new testament about the law because paul changes it so so what the dao is is this is this moral structure to the universe it is it is the existence of meaning and the existence of beauty is the existence of all that it itself is not god but it is it is there and it is real and it is more than just mere information this conception in all its forms platonic aristotelian stoic christian and oriental alike i shall henceforth refer to for brevity simply as the dao some of the accounts of it which i have quoted will seem perhaps to many of you merely quaint or even magical but what is common to them all is something we cannot neglect it is the doctrine of objective value the belief that certain attitudes are really true and others really false to the kind of thing the universe is and the kind of things we are that again certain attitudes okay attitudes are not mere emotion they are when when someone exhibits when someone exhibits courage they are exhibiting something that is not simply themselves their their their actions correspond with something deeper than what they are those who know the dao can hold that to call children delightful or old men venerable is not simply to record a psychological fact about our own parental or filial emotions at the moment but to recognize a quality which demands a certain response from us whether we make it or not i myself do not enjoy the society of small children because i speak from within the dao i recognize this as a defect in the society of small children and i do not see the difference i recognize this as a defect in myself just as a man may have to recognize that he is tone deaf or colorblind and because our approvals and disapprovals are thus recognitions of objective value or responses to an objective order therefore emotional states can be in harmony with reason when we feel liking for what ought to be approved or out of harmony with reason when we perceive that liking is due but cannot feel it now again pay attention sam harris practices this brett weinstein practices this jordan peterson practiced this but the question that you have for sam harris is does his philosophical system support this can it is it capable of holding this doesn't have the capacity for this and i would say no and and that's what sam is trying to do and he's trying to build it on on feelings of of well-being and putting your hand in the fire and pulling it out and and that's why in the conversation they say well you may rush in and save your own child but what is it that has you rush into the burning house and save your neighbor's child or even your enemy's child feel it no emotion is in itself a judgment in that sense all emotions and sentiments are illogical but they can be reasonable or unreasonable as they conform to reason or fail to conform the heart and again capital r the heart never takes the place of the head but it can and should obey it over against this stands the world of the green book in it the very possibility of a sentiment being reasonable or even unreasonable has been excluded from the outset it can be reasonable or unreasonable only if it conforms or fails to conform to something else to say that the cataract is sublime means saying that our emotion of humility is appropriate or ordinate to the reality and thus to speak of something else besides the emotion just as to say that a shoe fits is to speak not only of shoes but of feet but this reference to something beyond the emotion is what gaius and tissues exclude from every sentence containing a predicate of value such statements for them refer solely to the emotion now the emotion thus considered by itself cannot be either in agreement or disagreement with reason it is irrational not as a parallelism is irrational but as a physical event is irrational it does not rise even to the dignity of error on this view the world of facts without one trace of value and the world of feelings without one trace of truth or falsehood justice or injustice confront one another and no rapprochement is possible hence the educational problem is wholly different according as you stand within or without the dow for those within the task is to train in the pupil those responses which are in themselves appropriate whether anyone is making them or not and in making which the very nature of man consists those without if they are logical must regard all sentiments as equally non-rational as mere mists between us and the real objects as a result they must either decide to remove all sentiments as far as possible from the pupil's mind or else to encourage some sentiments for reasons that have nothing to do with their intrinsic justness or ordinacy the latter course involves them in the questionable process of creating in others by suggestion or incantation a mirage which their own reason has successfully dissipated in other words and this is true of harris too harris wants to say we shouldn't be religious okay why shouldn't we where is the standard well there's reason okay why reason well it just is because because reason has brought us cell phones and and reason has brought us all of these wonderful things and and by reason and then he uses reason therefore to debunk a whole bunch of things that he thinks need to be debunked okay but you haven't established for me any objective moral order well it's based on well-being but now we're back into relativism because if my well-being demands this of me certainly isn't going to have me rush in and save my enemy's child that's not good for my well-being what can you appeal to it did perhaps this will become clearer if we take a concrete instance when a roman father told his son that it was a sweet and seemly thing to die for his country he believed what he said he was communicating to the son an emotion which he himself shared and which he believed to be in accord with the value which his judgment discerned in noble death death he was giving the boy the best he had giving of his spirit to humanize him as he had given of his body to beget him but gaius and tish's cannot believe that in calling such a death sweet and seemingly they would be saying something important about something in other words his death well that's just your emotion about the death it's nothing more about something their own method of debunking would cry out against them if they attempted to do so for death is not something to eat and therefore cannot be doche in the literal sense and it is unlikely that the real sensations preceding it will be dodgy even by analogy and as for decorum that is only a word describing how some other people will feel about your death when they happen to think of it which won't be often and will certainly do you no good there are only two courses open to gaius and tissues either they must go the whole way and debunk this sentiment like any other or must set themselves to work to produce from outside a sentiment which they believe to be of no value to the pupil and which may cost him his life because it is useful to us the survivors that our young men should feel it now we're treading on the the way of now we're treading on the way of of matt dilahunty and well why why why do i seek to preserve my life because my ancestors did it's a feeling it's an instinct we're going to get into instinct later in this book our young men should feel it if they embark on this course the difference between the old and the new education will be an important one where the old initiated the new merely conditions the old dealt with its pupils as grown birds deal with young birds when they teach them to fly the new deals with them more as the poultry keeper deals with young birds making them thus or thus for purposes of which the birds know nothing in a word the old was a kind of propagation men transmitting manhood to men the new is merely propaganda it is to their credit that gaius and tissues embrace the first alternative propaganda is their abomination not because their own philosophy gives a ground for condemning it or anything else but because they are better than their principles they probably have some vague notion i will examine it in my next lecture that valor and good faith and justice could be sufficiently commended to the pupil on what they would call rational or biological or modern grounds if this is exactly the project here 50 plus years later if it should ever become necessary in the meantime they leave the matter alone and get on with the business of debunking that this course though less inhuman is not less disastrous than the opposite alternative of cynical propaganda let us suppose for a moment that the harder virtues could really be theoretically justified with no appeal to objective value it still remains true that no justification of virtue will enable a man to be virtuous without the aid of trained emotions the intellect is powerless against the animal organism i had sooner played cards against a man who was quite skeptical about ethics but bred to believe that a gentleman does not cheat than against an irreproachable moral philosopher who had been brought up among sharpers here louis makes the point that you can talk about ethics all day long but this actually is what gets trained into us and gets trained into us from very young and this for louis means well that's why this issue of the school books is important because as dallas willard noted this gets trained this gets this gets brought into you by body language by status conversation and and not directly through the front door in battle it is not syllogisms that will keep the reluctant nerves and muscles to their post in the third hour of the bombardment and remember louis was a veteran of the first world war he was in those bunkers he was in those trenches he was wounded in battle which what ended the war for him and fortunately for him he was wounded in such a way that he survived and it wouldn't let him back into the war the crudest sentimentalism such as guayas and tissues would wince at about a flag or a country or a regiment will be of more use we were told it in other words this this is the this is the irony you can go ahead and debunk the flag but when your country is assaulted well now suddenly you want to bring the flag out you've just undercut the whole thing and said all those are mere emotion you could feel one way about a flag and feel another way about another flag what does it matter there's no reason to get upset by any of it we were told it all long ago by plato as the king governs by his executive so reason in man must rule the mere appetites by means of the spirited element the head rules the belly through the chest the seat as alannus tells us of magnanimity of emotions organized by trained habit into stable sentiments the chest magnanimity sentiment these are the indispensable liaison offices between cerebral man and visceral man it may even be said that it is by this middle element that man is man for by his intellect he is mere spirit and by his appetite mere animal the operation of the green book and its kind is to produce what may be called men without chests it is an outrage that they should be commonly spoken of as intellectuals this gives them the chance to say that he who attacks them attacks intelligence it is not so they are not distinguished from other men by any unusual skill in finding truth nor any virginal arduo to pursue her indeed it would be strange if they were a persevering devotion to truth a nice sense of intellectual honor cannot be long maintained without the aid of a sentiment which gaius and tissues could debunk as easily as any other it is not excess of thought but defective fertile and generous emotion that marks them out their heads are no bigger than the ordinary it is the atrophy of the chest beneath that makes them seem so and here they're basically saying where's the ardor you can debunk any ardor because any emotion is mere emotion if if your if your mother dies in front of you brutally murdered well what do you feel outrage outrage is a mere emotion it has no correspondence to the crime that has been committed in front of you you've just undercut the whole business now fortunately again they're better than their principles so and all the time such is the tragic comedy of our situation we continue to clamor for those very qualities we are rendering impossible you can hardly open a periodical without coming across the statement that what our civilization needs is more drive or dynamism or self-sacrifice or creativity in a sort of ghastly simplicity we remove the organ and demand the function we make men without chests and expect of them virtue and enterprise we laugh at honor and are shocked to find traitors in our midst we castrate and bid the gildings be fruitful that last line lewis is such a master we castrate and bid the gildings be fruitful exactly what we're doing all those emotions that get stirred up of of of beauty you see beauty there's meaning there's truth there's there's things to live for there's things to die for you know in many ways the entire jordan peterson phenomenon is utterly predictable because at some point once it's all been debunked and what you say well i'm just having i'm just having feelings that's that's all i'm having okay but is there nothing to be angry about sam harris gets angry he's he rises up in righteous indignation about abuse of religion okay but what within your system allows you to do that that is what he's weak on that is what he can't explain that is what they're talking about but none of them on stage doubt the fact that we ought to do better than the chimps well why is there perhaps a moral order is there perhaps can we use values can use predicates of value that actually correspond to something well what kind of a world would enable that kind of existence that's what we're talking about
