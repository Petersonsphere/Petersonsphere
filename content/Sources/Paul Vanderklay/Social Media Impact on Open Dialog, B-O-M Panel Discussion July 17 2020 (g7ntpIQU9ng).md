 Hi this is Paul and for the last number of weeks I've been recording the question and answer sessions that we've been doing on the Bridges of Meaning Discord channel. I have now thoroughly bored the group and they have no more questions to ask and so Cassidy came up with an alternative plan for doing something with this time and so today we are going to try it and so Cassidy has been on my channel a number of times and so Cassidy why don't you explain your idea actually it was Topher's idea and go ahead and let us know how today's gonna flow. Yeah I was gonna say it was initially Topher's idea and then a couple of us banded together to make it a thing but basically the idea we're calling it randomizing randos and it was this way to create long-form conversations between bridges of meaning community members and you Paul and we tried to figure out a way that would be really fair so the idea was people we would announce topics of conversation let people submit to participate and then we would put all of those names in a randomizer and then we could announce those names and those were the people who would be able to participate and there's some ideas of working on how we can incorporate that into the broader community as well but we wanted to start with one of your Q&A's just to kind of test out the idea and see how it works like we were talking before we started recording we had this list of 23 people who submitted and only a couple actually showed up to participate and some couldn't be there the whole time so what we've decided is to include the people who have submitted their names who are here and can be here the whole time and then I'm gonna join the conversation myself and we're gonna have a long-form conversation on a topic and then anyone who's listening in live can submit questions into the randomizing Q&A text and we can we can enter those discuss so you can be a part and I think today since it is a smaller group we're gonna try to see if we can allow people to you know say hey I have a question and like your Q&A's use their own voice to ask the question and be a little bit a part of the conversation but we want to try to see how this long-form conversation goes on this medium and give people you know more of a chance to have those conversations who haven't been able to talk to you although most of us have been able to talk to you today but anyway so I'll announce who's gonna be here talking with us today so it's gonna be Andrew L, KG Guy, myself and Paul. Andrew and KG do you guys want to introduce yourselves briefly? Sure I'm Andrew and I've been here on this Discord for a little while and I'm just excited to have this discussion and through this idea that Tofer brought up so I don't have much else to introduce. No that's good. Just enough so they can hear your voice and attach a name to it. Sure. KG Guy? Yeah sure I've been on here for since like the beginning of the year and I'm on for creative reasons to meet other people who write and stuff like that and to pick the brains of other creatives who are going through similar stuff it's been very enlightening and I've got a lot of help out of it. Awesome yeah that's great. So today's selected topic is social media and its effects on open dialogue. This was sort of initially kind of submitted by Valerie and she has submitted a couple different topics broad topics and I kind of took a couple of those topics together and made the question and I found it really interesting because I think right now social media is really affecting the way that we talk about what's going on around us and people are using it more heavily than they ever have with the lockdowns and it definitely has trade offs when it comes to how we talk about issues and I thought it would be really interesting to talk about on this platform because discord is a type of social media and I found that a lot of what happened on this discord does encourage open dialogue but I haven't found the same pattern in other forms of social media and I don't know I think it's interesting what makes this different and we obviously sometimes have our in fighting on the discord in our spats but I do but I do think there is like an openness that I haven't found another corners of the internet so I don't know that's why I found it sort of interesting. When you say open dialogue can you can you expand that a little bit more? Yeah so I think I've been for the past couple years been really interested in sort of the IDW and this little corner on YouTube that has really valued in the open marketplace of ideas and discussing hard topics and not really walking this PC narrative that that lives in in a lot of culture and I work in entertainment so it's very prevalent and I see that kind of behavior of trying to shut down and not talk about things very prevalent on things like Facebook or Instagram where it's it's very very short you know when you have 140 characters to talk about something it creates a lot of division but I come on this discord and I jump into a voice channel and people are talking about hard topics whether it's politics theology religion philosophy in very nuanced ways and I sometimes feel like social media has created a death of nuance which is so sad for a very long-winded nuanced thinker. I think that's a really good observation. Yeah I guess that's what I kind of mean about open dialogue but I'd be interested to hear what you guys what how you guys are seeing it and especially since I'll go ahead. Yeah it's it's also indicative of participation when you guys were talking before we started recording that like you said what 23 people had signed on and only a few of them are here. Right. I think that's I think that's understandable because it's like that I've been talking to a lot of people on here and a lot of them wouldn't be on a video with Paul because they're extremely private. So like I was talking to Ginger Bill the other day and he said yeah I would I would be fine I don't think I would turn my camera on or something like that and it kind of makes it kind of makes sense that people who probably don't have a more of a presence opt-in but not participate. Okay I think. Kevin can you turn your mic down a little bit I think you've got a pretty good mic there I don't know if you've got control on it but just turn it down a little bit just for the sake of the recording keep going. Um if I can. Trying to actually make a recording out of stuff like this on the Discord has its own challenges even for a guy whose channel is dramatically poor in terms of quality. How about if I stay this far away I can't find. Yeah that's a little bit better. Yeah that's better. I think Andrew did you have something to say to that? I was like I mean some of my observations that I've noticed I'm gonna specifically harp on Discord itself as a medium. There's like when I've gone on different servers it's very the atmosphere is different and there's it becomes much more like I have planted myself back into almost a more normal social media and I remind myself oh yeah Discord is actually a technically you could you would easily categorize it into social media and which is strange because for a while I just when I was on here I just didn't recognize it as a social media. Right. Sometimes I ended up spending too much time on here like oh gosh. It's very different because you can actually interact. Yeah. Yeah the voice I think is a huge game changer where you're just sitting and having voice conversations with people and I like to consider myself an inspiring digital minimalist where I try to make my social media consumption and like my participation on those platforms as small as possible because I actually don't think it's the best for the human brain. Yeah. But I do find healthy participation in this Discord to an extent. I think there's times where it has gotten unhealthy for me and I've had to take breaks but it's it's very different and I always say if I didn't work in entertainment I would have no social media at all. It's the only reason I have it but if I did get rid of everything I would keep Discord and for some reason it's social media but I don't see it that way and I don't know why. Yeah I only keep Facebook around for my volunteer ambulance squad that I'm on so it's like the medium that they communicate on so I'm like fine I'll submit to this but I really I dislike Facebook and Instagram because especially with what I was gonna say about like recent times it's like a lot of virtue signaling is what I've picked up I'm just like oh like I'd rather talk to you for about 20 minutes or so about some of these crazy times that we've been going through whatever topic I mean there's tons of crazy things that are going on that we could talk about but I'd rather do that for 20 minutes than see someone you know write something that just... A pistol. Yeah it's like I'm trying to remember the phrase that I came up with but... Are you saying the back and forth on text is almost more draining than just sitting for 20 minutes hearing someone talk? Well more so like I'm talking about broad social media like Facebook Instagram not on Discord and how that can just be like because I was on this it's like my town Facebook was just like went into some really weird stuff I was like oh gosh because they're just they're they're all very it seems like they're they're all very smart people but the I think the tolerance for having long conversations is just not there. Do you think that that is fueled by social media culture or do you think that was always sort of in our human psyche? It's always had a bit of tribalism to us but the I think the kind of claustrophobic medium of something like Facebook and especially Twitter which is even more claustrophobic because you have so many little messages going off at the same time and so it's you have to be as loud as possible to even be seen and so it gets it it becomes a shouting match us to enter the conversation. Right. Yeah it's the structure of the mediums what I was sort of thinking of I mean with Facebook you'll just get like a 20 page rant and then in Twitter you'll just get someone who's trying to shout as loud as they can and however many characters you know. Speaking towards the the healthiness of like something like Discord but when I joined a few months back I was not very productive and I felt like I feel like the more I had participated with folks on here the more actually got done off Discord. Right. There was there was something about it like where you hear something like Twitter or Facebook or especially YouTube people say well I logged on and then I saw the cat video and the next thing I knew it was midnight I couldn't get anything done that day it's like yeah yeah that that makes sense but you get on to Discord you have a good conversation then you leave like and feel better. Right there's a psych inspiration cycle where we're and I signed now my YouTube spirals end up being more productive than not because I just you know watch lectures and stuff but you go away and like you you have you're not just watching things that aren't aren't important I guess you're talking we're talking about important things and we're dealing through issues and we're challenging our assumptions and so you go away feeling like you have to do something with this new thing that's going on in your brain. Yeah for sure. I mean Paul I'd be interested in hearing some of your perspective because you're on YouTube and you have this channel and I know you're not trying to get famous but you have a lot of people who do similar things to you talking about you know big ideas who are looking for this clickbait culture and trying to be outrageous to get views and like how does that feel to be a like a part of that world? Well I I've just been listening to you know the three of you talk about this and taking some notes along the way and and finding so okay social media its impact on open dialogue and there was I think in the formation of the question a you know that there was to pick up on Savilla King's we should really get Savilla in this Discord server to pick up on Savilla King's focus on quality and value because and then listening to Andrew and and Kevin and Cassidy to listen to sort of listen to all of you sort of dissect a bit okay I go on Facebook and why do I hate it so much so there's virtue signaling going on okay well there's plenty of virtue signaling going on on our Discord server in some ways and then there's the question of length because Andrew mentioned you know you get a you know a sermon I mean sermon is is kind of long virtue signal I mean that's it's it's it's as a preacher it's the most you know it's the most grit you know cringy thing we can think about and and so is it length because you know so we talked about nuance here you know and also Andrew talked about the fact that he goes to other Discord servers and oh yeah this is a social media so so there's so we have developed here on the bridges of meaning Discord server a degree of culture and and I found that very much to be true because Twitter for example can be a real cesspool Twitter Twitter can be a dog fight Twitter can be you know a Hobbesian nightmare of constant warfare but depending on how you sort of tailor your feed you know I remember I was I was we were we're talking I was talking with someone about ThinkSpot which is Jordan Peterson's you know social basically a social media platform to try to rival YouTube and the the big deal on ThinkSpot was going to be we're gonna have no other rule but you know you can say anything that's legal okay so then so then part of my when sort of the patreon thing sort of was falling apart and I didn't know what to do with my patreon account because I had one of those and then people start going to ThinkStar or subscribe star and then there was the thing well there's you know some pornographers on subscribe star and then it's like well boy and then I was looking at ThinkSpot and thinking what if you know you know pornographers decide to go on ThinkSpot to try to go there because that's free speech and then someone said well there's pornography on Twitter and I thought I've never seen any porn on Twitter and so I talked to Joey and Joey said he had the same realization and so he did a few clicks and says oh yeah there's porn on Twitter sorry Joey but but I you know for me Twitter wasn't Twitter wasn't such a bad experience now it's gotten worse because to one degree or another I've waded into some of these conversations which we could I think think about as open dialogue people at least speaking themselves but but you know and my I really I would love to give up my Facebook account except that you know family and friends but but Facebook has I guess what I'm trying to get at is I don't think we have even articulated exactly what it is about social media that we are instinctively finding unhealthy distasteful now there's certain elements of it kind of the the addictive quality to it but you know I think that article that Internet of Beef's really got at that in a way because there is this dynamic of mooks and nights and in a sense social media sort of like reality TV has has created a has created a context in which we in a rather disgusting way feed off of unhealthy drama in the way that Housewives of New Jersey or how many you know it doesn't seem to be an and it doesn't seem to be coincidental that social media arose at the same time as reality TV so so I I'd like us to to to go a little bit deeper into this question of okay so we go on to social media and we're watching this and we're even participating in it but gosh you get there are sometimes that I turn off Twitter and I think I gotta I gotta put limits on me and this platform because it's corrupting my soul in a way that and and and soul corruption isn't even just gosh I just blew two hours there but I blew two hours there and I feel like I need to take a shower and find a good Christian to confess my sins to because this is this is this is making me this is sending me in the wrong direction from what my faith aspires me to move towards so I'd like us to dig in I mean so we all can sort of beef about the Internet of Beefs but I'd like us to dig a little bit deeper into well what what really is going on here and sort of in a vervecchian sense what is and I haven't mastered all his fancy vervecchi words yet but but what is the you know what is the reciprocal narrowing that is going on in social media that we both find addictive and soul-crushing right but it's it's interesting you bring up reality TV because I am NOT a fan of the medium of reality TV but I am so fascinated by the way that it represents people and rewires our brains to see culture and I was talking to my roommates about this yesterday because they're they're big bachelor fans and so I've I sat and I've watched certain things and I dissect these things that are going on in this bachelor world and how they've created they've cut this together to make someone look like a villain and they've they've cut this together to make it look like a hero and so you have a lot of people especially young women taking this in and watching the bachelor and it's rewiring their narrative of what it is to find love and to be in a healthy relationship and that's very dangerous especially if you're not thinking about that intentionally now I'm not an advocate censorship necessarily so it's not like Mike we should get rid of the bachelor but I do think that there is something to be said of like how we need to talk that we can media especially media that is or you know light like my roommates are also really interested in the makeup YouTube scene you know these these influencers doing makeup and stuff and you know I they always joke that anytime like how's the makeup world there's like shut up you don't care I'm like I don't but I do find that world fascinating and I think a lot of what that world is is fueled by is the drama that exists in that world and you know Jane Dawson is a big influencer in that world and right now he's going through a sort of cancer culture thing because when YouTube started he was this gross out shock humor guy who's then pivoted to be this makeup guru and now all of this kind of what was always inappropriate but now people are really saying inappropriate stuff is coming out and so it's like how is that how now how do we now move forward and like live in this world where reality like reality TV and social media has created these versions of people as heroes and villains and but people are much more complicated and their gray scales but now we have to make decisions where our lives lies and it really matters what you do that on Twitter because it could ruin your career yeah I could ruin you and the thing you bring up there with editing I think that's why a lot of long-form stuff has gotten really popular because it's completely unedited if you might take off the front and the back you know from conversation or something like that just just random stuff but outside of the intro and the outro everything in there is what you see yeah and so it's it somebody can lie to you you can tell because it doesn't match up with the rest of the conversation and yeah whereas in in editing you can cut you can cut a scene where it sounds like that lie lines up with the rest of the conversation right and I do think that is a big reason long-form is getting popular but what I have noticed and I don't know if this exists in all you know cultures but that the cultures that I'm in especially entertainment most people don't see don't go and look for the long form they see the cliff and go oh my gosh it's so clear can't you see and it's like wait hold on what's the context and sometimes to say wait what's the context like that question is not even tolerable the fact that you would even ask that shows shows that the evil that lies within you and it's it's scary and you're questioning me I've always been asking that question the contact yeah and I don't think it exists oh sorry go ahead I just mean I don't think it exists everywhere and I think that eventually that culture is gonna break because people are gonna have this like a similar thing that I did when I started becoming very interested in IDW of like oh maybe I don't know as much as I think I do like everybody has those moments and it's gonna break but how do we how do we encourage nuance on social media platforms where it's it's hard to cultivate yeah I think you get that here to an extent I mean one of the things that I was thinking when you were especially talking about the reality TV I was thinking about well a lot of it's just we have been thinking about this is like we just tend to think in narratives and we just relate to the world in that sense and then that's also I think the problem with social media is that the narrative is so short and we don't really get the full story from someone and sort of in a sense also the context from which they are expressing a certain view on to the world and so then you have the easy placement of people into camps that are facing each other that are spewing stuff at each other and throwing like grenades into each other's camps like you suck it's just like this bipolarity of the just the the nature of the social media but it's always in different contexts or like different what's different systems basically of how they operate yeah I want to highlight about about discord there's a there's a there is a negative side like I don't want to paint it like some perfect platform or something I've seen I've seen people like because in the general chat there's been some debates recently between our resident former Orthodox Jew and southern Baptist and they've just been going back and forth and back and forth and sometimes it gets kind of heated and people ask them to move to the forum because that's kind of where you can have nice open debate but I don't think it can't it can get heated but I don't think it's ever really gotten to the point where people are outright insulting each other they'll catch each other and say like hey that's going a bit too far but then usually you'll hear them apologize and I think that's I think that's different though because I've heard folks say you know don't apologize to the mob it's like yeah that's a mob these guys are literally apologizing directly back to each other yeah that's very different is that in a sense because most people on here you know we don't I mean we sort of fall into different camps but we all sort of realize that we have different takes on our camps in a sense so I wouldn't even really call it a camp we mostly see each other as individuals but there's still been times when people have gone too far and sometimes apologies haven't been made so it's not always the ideal but sometimes you know and that's just human nature in a sense but the I guess the ratio of interactions where things have been inflammatory is pretty to like just normal interactions are pretty low compared to like social media where the percentage is pretty high the ratio of forgiveness though is a lot higher yeah you you probably will not be forgiven on any other platform oh yeah well that gets back to the question of culture here that there is a culture that has developed here where in a part of this obviously has to do with the high level of religious participants in this forum so you know I'll sometimes go over I haven't done it for a while but I'll go over and lurk in some other forums like the portal discord and and ask questions because I'm curious about that and so you know obviously that there there's culture that's that's that's developed here there have been people who have you know flamed out and slammed the door the two or three people to my knowledge have been banned because culture you know even culture does have to have a certain degree of enforcement my I my preference is to give live people give people a lot of rope and generally speaking if you give them a lot of rope they'll usually you know do something you know do something self-destructive with it but but usually in a social media platform that's something they can come back from and there are a few people in bridges of meaning discord that have left and come back several times and and in many cases they've got their own demons they're working through but but you know I do think you know I look at social media and reality TV in some ways sort of as junk food because you know we've all got this it was one of the things that I've you know I've learned a lot from Peterson and verveky is a lot about cognitive science in terms of the fact that here the world is so enormously large how do we handle this complexity we handle it via narratives narratives stories are unbelievably powerful compression algorithms that take huge amounts of reality and compress it down into manageable ways for us to deal with and we as human beings develop very early on in life this capacity to use narratives we see ourselves as narratives that's how we manage the complexity of our lives we see the culture around us as a narrative that's how we manage the enormous complexity of communities of of tens dozens thousands millions of people through these narratives and so so now we go out into the world and we want to engage with the world productively well now now we get into this Jordan Peterson chaos order realm where we need just enough this you know bicameral brain thing where we need just enough chaos to keep us interested but we don't it too much chaos we sort of you know lose the thread and have to go back into a dark place and suck our thumb and regroup and you know and you see this same process happening with social media where we go out into social media because there's a degree of chaos there there's the chaos of other human beings and we want to go out and gather information Cassidy before we started recording talked about herself as a sort of an addict of information and so she goes out and we go out into social media partly because of this this along the way we have figured out watching movies and television shows that are highly edited and highly scripted we like it because the narratives are clean and well developed and some of the smartest best people have gone into making this this production for us so we really enjoy that but now with social media now with reality TV in a sense we have the sense of ooh this is this is less scripted now in the case of reality TV the bullshitting we have sort of gotten accustomed to the bullshitting and seen okay so so an editor and a producer and they've spun this into a narrative and we're not really seeing the people in all of their glorious nuanced complexity chaos the good and the bad we're seeing a character that this this editor has created out of the volumes of of of reality TV footage constructed and into a narrative and of course they have done that and I think Cassidy is right in that they do this because this grabs a larger audience but then there are these these spielunkers like you all who know I really want to get down into the roots of the mountain here and I really want to dig down and okay so now social media is in a sense a great platform for that but the the platforms themselves and the algorithms in many ways have now taken on the roles of the editors of reality TV they are constructing the narratives Twitter is showing me the the feeds that Twitter is guessing based on what I've looked at so far what I want YouTube you know Cassidy asked me about YouTube one of the very interesting things that I continue to learn is just watching YouTube and how it works so I'll see a video from a small channel that suddenly gets you know hundreds of thousands of views okay what's in the title what's in the thumbnail why did YouTube prioritize that I look at you know I listen to Benjamin Boyce and Jonathan Peugeot talk about not exactly shadow banning on YouTube but you know you know that the algorithm is is monkeying with it and you know Jonathan and Benjamin suspecting that YouTube is suppressing their channels that's them okay well that's interesting so there's I mean in a sense we go out into social media imagining we are going out into the street well what is the street now your street is also the product of you know generations of editing intentional editing on the part of politicians and police officers and neighbors and and so you know none of this is without human fingerprints but so now we go out into social media and it's just sort of like you know sitting in my office it's I have to keep snacks out of my office because if I have a snacks here I will just sit here in front of my you know doing my work and consume a bag of chocolate or a bag of chips or something and after I do it it's like that was a dumb idea and that's very much the same sense I get out of too much social media so I don't know that's yeah again listening to you all these are some of the the threads that seem to be emerging the going back into the cave and sucking your thumb that's what you get from eating the junk food of social media yes you eat that it's like eating a whole pie of pizza you're like oh my gosh I feel so bad yes yes or like having a cart of ice cream you're just like oh but yeah and I think the nice thing that I've gotten out of this discord for sure is that everyone is seems like generally across the board I found that people are when we've actually compared you know the big five people are very high in openness and so it's always been nice because everyone's in a sense has always has their flashlight on in the dark and trying to find and they have like a big flashlight so it's like really bright and they're all looking for something and it's just like they're all just scurrying around in the mines or whatever and like reading books like what can I get out this you know stuff like that wait on walking out into the street like the way that I look at at social media is your you're you're walking into somebody else's book but is that book that that everybody has access to and they're all writing in it and it's completely incomprehensible oh the story that's being kind of conducted the analogy that I use it comes to this stuff is I talked to Andrea with the bangs and we had talked about what happened to George Lucas's story why did it kind of go off the rails with the the prequels and I said well there the original trilogy had a good editor that was his wife well he divorced his wife if he had never done that we probably would have had a great holes like the entire series would have been great but we've got you've got the vision of a single man then you've got the the people underneath them and the something like this discord the vision of a single man is all and so we're all kind of all kind of in the same vein because we kind of understand our perspective of what Paul thinks and that that keeps us in a frame of mind especially when we're interacting with each other here but go out on the Facebook and it's like okay what is the perspective of Mark Zuckerberg nobody knows the guy's a weird blank slate and all of the people under him are are corporate and so they're all just starting corporate taglines and you go under that and then you've just got media you go under that and you've got no rich people you go under that it's like it's spreading out and you've got this giant pyramid of people disseminating an idea that they don't understand and it's like it's no wonder why there's no overarching story to Facebook yeah I think when you mentioned the pyramid it made you made me think of sort of this analogy that I've been thinking of was is like story mapping and mapping and this is why I've liked about Paul does and why I've listened to a bunch of actually especially as older conversations with people is being able to just lay out how you thought about things and sort of mapping it to each other and showing okay here was this mountain range where I was having this great time and things just collapsed and I went into like this awful ravine and sort of and then also projecting not projecting that is loaded word but expressing sort of a compass in a way that you use to get out of maybe the ravine and that's sort of how I've been thinking about stories recently is like how could that and I feel like the open way that Paul talks to people is how we could maybe do that. There's an infectious openness to it. Yeah yeah because it's just there's no real bars being held and you can just sort of and I also if you want a reference for this towards the end of my I talked with Coleppa towards my last video with him I talked pretty extensively I'm not giving the best account of this idea but we all need to be able to willingly share our stories and our maps and then we can and our compass as well and we can get a solid landscape it's the basically it's the reverse of because I've read about 40 pages of Sam Harris's moral landscape it's the reverse of that he projects the landscape on from one perspective in a way or where he's just sitting and he's not walking around the mountain range but this is we in a sense are all out there but we have like a collective meeting point which is like this maybe it's in a sense it's also this discord because we all meet here and we express their story yeah and so we all are here and then we go out in this sense into our own realm and come back and be like oh this is my work you know this is a little bit little chunk of my story but yeah it's interesting you bring up the moral landscape because I remember he was William Lane Craig or something talking about the idea of what's the best for human suffering like that's that's a subjective question the same way like if you were asking what's the best way to get to this certain destination well it depends on what you're looking at are you looking for the scenic view are you looking for the quickest way to get there because those are two different things and that's where yeah sometimes when we get caught in our own narratives it's like the best for what and I will say as far as some of what the PC culture and what social media does is give voices people voices which is good because there's power in our stories I think the problem becomes when we make our personal stories this ultimate proof and then we can't we just keep seeing it through that lens without without opening up to the nuance and you know I I think one thing that does this social media platform does well in integrating the voice because when you're talking about communications over text we have no idea of inflection so we can we can look at these heated conversations we're seeing between these two people with varying beliefs and sometimes you can look at them go oh my gosh these people hate each other but it's in some ways it's like the same cultural communication if someone who came from a very reserved Catholic family went into a very loud argument of Italian Italian family and they hate each other but that's just how they communicate that's their cultural communication and they understand that and so we we take our own little narratives we plop ourselves in the middle of someone else's and use our lens to understand what's going on and social media it's hard not to do that with social media but it's so much more nuanced and because we have voice channels we can sit and go oh that we hear those two people talking civet civilly other time and then they get really heated but that's just that they're on the same operating level you know what they're doing maybe it's not as hateful as we think but you know sometimes there's trolls sometimes there's hate but you know to the point where you can't say anything because you're you're spending too much time apologizing so you just have to say what you have to say is typing the whole thing or else you're gonna get no vacant apologetics of I don't want you to feel you know intimidated by this or anything like that okay just get past the apology and get to the point yeah I think this was hint or I think Cassidy talked about this a little bit prior was sort of the healthiness of the discord and also just comparing it to other places I've gotten really a lot of benefit from just being able to sometimes just sit here talk to people when I've been like something like in in the sense my nature is to just isolate myself but sometimes I find for some reason this media easy to just talk to people I think it might also have to again do with the openness aspect of this area of the internet well I think Paul did make a point about and Joey has said this too I've had conversations with him there is a lot of Christians on the server and when we look at who Jesus was and his sort of ethos there is a lot of like forgiving your brother and helping you know you know like being there for others and creating community and I always think about what is my what is my what is my role as a Christian when it comes to hard conversations and I always end up in the place I need to be the person who is not easily offended and doesn't go out of their way to offend people and that's a hard line to balance and you know we I think I think sometimes even when there is a lot of tension and heat and we're all humans we all fail there are a lot of people who are willing to apologize and move forward and there's so many times where there's so many people who want to come together and like love and it doesn't matter what your background is like we want you to feel like you can come and talk about the things it doesn't always have to be these deep intellectual questions there's people who've come with their burdens and been able to we've been able to help each other and that's really awesome and I I wonder if if there wasn't so many much many religious people on there would we be able to keep that going I don't know it depends I think it depends on the culture I mean I think you raise a good point but I mean in a sense also with the burdens those can almost be like those are usually probably the deepest conversations in a way even if like if you're comparing like the deepest philosophical questions or conversations you can get into if you like start talking about your burdens it's almost like in a sense it's almost like a Pandora's box or I mean sometimes it's almost like our microcosms of maybe you could say chaos I don't know but yeah but it's funny so listening to Sean McDowell talk to John Steingard the guy from Hawking Nelson who left left the Christian faith and they were talking about how you know atheists don't really have strong community church groups like churches do and and you know people have tried but they haven't lasted and why that is and I you know I wonder is there is there something to you know like because we have people of all different denominations and different religions on here is there something to this commitment to religion that does make this more sustainable and if we try to get rid of that is it going to crumble I you know I've been working through the Sermon on the Mount in my Sunday sermons and going through it again this time so much in that sermon is about creating a culture of interpersonal relationships and I think so much of what Jesus does is if you take these values and you raise them up as high as Jesus does these will help you form a healthy community you know when I you know when Andrew when you were talking about you know how much time you spend here and and also talking about how it's fun to come to the discord and get some new information you know get a new book recommendation get a new video to watch that's that's all cool but it's the bonds of love and community that make that make a community durable I see that in churches you know it's the this this is that this is the place where your heart was broken and people came around you this is the place where you had a need and people sacrificed to help you out and it's those kinds of interchanges and interactions that that build a strong bond I remember a number of years ago camping in came into United States culture in the 60s that could be a whole nother conversation but one of the things that that sociologists noted was that families who camped together had a greater sense of community and I think part of that was the chaos and unpredictability of nature you know if you camped out on the East Coast you spend a lot of time camping in the rain which I did growing up you do that as a family and you that that that suffering and that together and suffering bonds you and so many of the teachings of Jesus are like I'm preaching this week on Judge Not That You Be Not Judged so many of these teachings call for sacrifice for one another for the welfare of the community and if a community really does practice this and if even if even only 20% of the community practices practices in a serious way the community will form and as I've been watching this discord form one of the amazing things that I've seen is how often these church qualities have happened in this context even in this social media format so I and I think when it comes to I think when it comes to atheist communities it's it's not that atheist communities can't form but you're not going to get the elevation of these values I think those values are within atheist communities because they're within our culture generally but you're not going to get the prioritizing and the repetition of these values in a determined way where you know just to sort of you know hack us as you know hack us as human beings where in this community you are going to lose status for being a jerk because that's not just the normal losing status in a community for being a jerk because communities have a certain degree of resilience to jerks if the community is getting other things from those jerks but this is a community where Jesus is king and so you're at least going to have to show some of the values and quality of Jesus if you want status in that community and here at the front of this building is a cross or a cross with a a tortured man on it and that sets a tone that I think is productive for the creation and maintenance of a community often where lonely and hurting people can gather. Yeah that's that's like the in a sense the total benefit and blessing of Christianity is that there is a ease of forgiveness and lightening of the burden in a sense because you can just be like well we all are fallen creatures in a sense but we and we need to be able to recognize that in each other as well. That's I think part of the mob culture in a sense with social media is they find the victim in the other camp and they're like all right get that guy. Yep pile on. Yep they just hop across the trench that's dividing them and you know stab them or whatever you know just go at them and and the other camp can't really do anything because in a sense still must like they're in this other section where they can't just can't help you know. Well and to get back to the earlier comment about open dialogue well once you have this this gang warfare culture take over you do lose nuance because I forget this quote I picked up from the you know the relationship between nuance nuance and tyranny. I mean you lose nuance you lose nuance you're going to have tyranny because it's not just the it's not just the the threat of violence verbal or at least verbal assault against members of the rival or opposing tribe you keep your tribe together by the threat of violence with breaking rank because you're ready to do damage against that other army of mooks on the other side of the divide but you're really going to save your fiercest judgment towards the traders in your own midst and once that type of culture digs in and I think social media especially with the algorithmic purifying effects that the commercial platforms have adopted once that culture takes hold well you're just you've basically set up a tyrannical system and and now not only do we see the life of the university played in the streets these days not only is every place evergreen not every place actually but certain not only is Seattle and Portland and areas of other blue state cities evergreen but but now social media is gang warfare because you know you don't dare say you know do do all black lives matter or only the ones who are killed by white cops you don't dare say that right because because your group is going to enforce that because that's the value of this group now when it comes to Jesus you know here we have a guy who everyone wants to kill and in fact he's been turned over by one of his 12 and so right there at the midst of the church ideally you have a capacity not only for thick community that we deeply need and desire but also for a community hopefully where we can get into nuance which is anti-tyrannical with the betrayal part it's almost like we've reached the bottom of hell if we're talking Dante's Inferno with betrayal yep yep that's exactly right well I was um I was watching a Ted Talk by John Ronson and he talks about social media and social media shaming and and one of his big points is we've now created a license to do really say and do really uncompassionate things in the name of compassion and that's that's what what I do think social media has really created because there is this wall where when you're not face to face to a person you're much more willing you're much more willing to say worse things than you would ever say someone to their face yes and you know when it's in the name of you know standing up for the rights of lives lost unjustly or for you know discrimination against an outside group it's it's really hard to terrain that in and it becomes this status if you can tear down someone else in the in the name of of niceness yeah it doesn't make sense it's a contradiction it's easier to virtue signal too just for that reason well and then virtue signaling becomes a status play and that sets up all the wrong dynamics again which again right at the center of Jesus right at the center of Jesus' sermon on the mount are three lessons in anti-virtue signaling right there at the middle when you do your forms of righteousness do them where nobody sees it's right there in the sermon on the mount and it's it's disturbing as well that how many of these people do that yet they're doing it as a form of status seeking and the people that actually get status doing things already have status to begin with it's like i i'm going to get famous being famous then get more famous it's like and and yet and yet the buddy beneath them is trying to do the same thing and can't do it and it's trying to do the same thing and can't do it and it just became it's like a capitalism of a virtue signaling yeah and and suddenly they get resentful of each other and themselves because they're they're seeing the same thing that they don't like in capitalism in virtue signaling and they can't fight it because it's their tribe yeah they start kicking each other down the pyramid as they're trying to climb up when someone starts getting close to me oh i'm gonna kick you down you're not gonna get to the top i'm gonna beat you i'm gonna be more woke and it's and it's that antithesis which will of course absolutely destroy community and set up this internet of beefs and set up this gang warfare the serengeti you know law of the jungle and yeah and and then we hate that because we hate it and we love it yeah it there's i think you've you've brought it up before of uh what was it called blood sports um yeah it was i was around for the beginning of that and it was it was interesting i thought it was i thought it was a good way of getting some open dialogue out there but doing it kind of in a more of an entertainment way but it turned it quickly turned into um rivalries and shouting matches and it became unhealthy very fast and you could see the folks that got into it and the folks that realized what was going on and got out of it sargon of a cod was involved with it very early on and there's another guy called uh uh i can't i can't remember his name but he one of the guys that that really got into it um in a little bit too far and was talking was talking to a friend of his and he's in canada and he was talking about his friend you know waving around a gun or something like that it it just got stupid and and and he he dropped off the map because he got into legal trouble and it's because he wanted to be more and more outrageous and there's there's a viral that people get into when it comes to um rage and and anger and um tim pool has been bringing it up recently it's like these people don't want solutions they want to be angry there's a a comic that's like hey it was like man i can't stand this thing well oh here's the solution to your problem and he smacks down whatever the guy's holding and he says i don't want a solution i want to be angry right right that doesn't help anything right yeah when you when you brought up the spiral it made me think of in a sense we have like it's like the opposite of the spiral in a way where we're we're circling outwards but we keep on getting farther and farther from what maybe you could call um i guess what in a sense this discord aims for some sort of truth whatever you want to claim that to be or however you want to find that but it's like and you also get this uh phenomenon of disillusion because you're getting so farther and farther away from each other and it becomes this separation and that's sort of part of another like dimension of social media is that you it's the paradox of we're much more connected but we're also so much more disconnected because we're just in the face of someone i think clarity would be a lot more accurate because truth is so yeah clarity is a good one but if if something is a little bit more clear people can gather together more yeah or just like a general tealows there's there's no tealows anymore just the yeah i don't know exactly how to describe the outside of the spiral but the inverse spiral it's also makes me think of pageau and his talk inversion yep yep yep yep you get to a certain point and you know it comes back around the clown the clown is now the sane one because everyone else is being the clown yeah yeah well i think there's i think there's some truth to say that there is some sort of uh unity around division or outrage and like those and i don't think it's a healthy type of unity but there's and it's marketable right there's a reason milo unopolis did what he did because it got him views and you know there's there is there's a market for the outrageous and i think there's a lot of people who argue that's why trump sometimes talks the way that he talks because if he's pc and like every other politician he's not going to get as much news coverage as if he says outrageous things and doesn't censor himself and i don't think that's healthy but how do we get outside of that unity because there is i think so many people and you're and you're seeing it i think especially in conservatives because they've been told for so long that they're you know or they people feel that they've been told so long that they're evil for being for holding these conservative beliefs and they don't care about people and it's just frustrating and then finally you get people like candice ellings who will scream and say you can't tell me whatever and and does all these things and and i think for a lot of conservatives they can hear some of these things that these sort of loud screaming conservatives say and go okay i can agree with i can agree with some of the underlying issues but i don't agree with the way you're doing it but they they do it that way because that's what gets them the views and so it's this real negative feedback loop that we as individual humans are feeding into because there's something in us something really dark and disgusting that loves the the drama and the outrage there's something more effective about speaking out in strength um way that the way that candace candace owens does owens does like you don't you don't gauge a whole lot of weakness for her communication style there's there there's the uh fast fast acting thing is shock value of wow she just said that and that will jar a few people either towards her or away from her and then you've got a very slow thoughtical um long suffering of the books in the in early roman time the christians in early roman times that had no status there's something there's there's something more long lasting about that that seeps into people um where paul had brought it up before of the the the there's more of a story about the servant or slave that um felt her own and then the her master the you know i think it's so platform when we think about you know the question this you know kind of became sort of a conservative uh fever point about structural racism um let's let's look at structure with respect to these dynamics so a social media platform understands that in terms of our our our salience hierarchy someone getting angry grabs our attention now why would that be because if you're in a room and someone gets really angry you have to pay attention to them because anger is sort of a pre um is sort of an early indicator of potential violence so our bodies are are now tuned so that if someone in the room gets really angry and they start shouting outrageously we look at them okay so now you have a platform and the the goal of that platform is a commercial platform and the coin of that platform is attention and so what you do is you tune that platform to attract the attention of as many people as possible so okay so now what we're doing is outrage is the coin because outrage and anger go together and we are naturally disposed to look at that which is violent that which is angry that which because that's how we're tuned in normal society to look around and just like the church is tuned by the values of Jesus of uh judge not that you be not judged turn the other cheek don't do your righteousness in public these are all the value tunings of Jesus that he intends to to to dominate the community now what we have in social media platforms are this other tuning by our amygdalas and by our limbic systems to draw our attention to you know all of the usual suspects that grab our attention because in a normal in a in a in a community of a few dozen human beings we have to pay attention to these signals but you up those signals now what happens when this is being done to an enormous to a large population especially a bunch of younger people that not that tuning is also retuning their minds and again i think part of what we're seeing in public right now is a result of this tuning i think jonathan height has brought this up in his work and you know looking at the hockey stick of young teenage girl suicides well as jonathan height pointed out because boys are much more physical in terms of their interaction with each other somebody gets mad over there some boys might do some pushing and shoving and you know maybe some fists will be thrown but that might be a bloody nose and a little bit of you know some bruising but sort of the natural cycle is at the end of it everybody kind of okay we kind of let off our steam and and now we're okay with the girls well you've just weaponized their um you know their character assassination way which is parallel to the boys throwing fists you've just weaponized that and you've just amplified it and boy wouldn't want to be a girl in this in this situation because and and this is all for money it's all for money and that's the structural aspect of it and it's evil oh uh oh no i'm here okay well should we just thinking about that do we do question time right yeah we want to go into question time yeah i think that's a good place so if there's anybody who's listening who has a question about what we've been talking about feel free to to come unmuted and ask a question or if you just want to add something go ahead if not i guess we can continue but i think yeah now is probably a good time for anybody who wants to join if i want to go in a parallel to sort of the start of what you said paul is i think jordan peterson has used the analogy in that sense with the the attention part um uh he used the lecture hall as an example and when someone starts just doing something strange in a lecture hall you instantly pick up on it and you're like what the heck who do these people think they are you know in a sense this you know it's now now it's like the attention people who started out in the the rows of seats have come down to the stage and now they have almost um um just disposed of the professor yeah yeah and it's it's interesting you bring up young women because last night i was listening to the joe rogan his joe rogan podcast with abigail schreier who wrote uh she just wrote a book about the the mass transitioning of young female women and how she thinks that it's not truly gender dysphoria as the as it's been defined but it's sort of this contagion that has you know young women are very susceptible and you're seeing these groups of friends all become trans all at the same time and it's a symptom of something more than just this dysphoria that it's it's become this thing to help fix their anxiety and make them feel accepted and you know social media is a huge part of that movement and so it's it's yeah it's hard to like i'm so glad i grew up when i did and not i'm not a young woman now like in my teens because social media is so much more prevalent and dangerous than when i when i was growing up even though i still think it's a problem for my generation but there's just a lot that happens there that for especially for young women is very concerning well when you look at a structural evil you know people would say well the patriarchy oh okay the patriarchy well what what what do we call it when facebook what would do what do we call it when the facebook corporation which owns instagram does a number on teenage girls that leads to suicide an overwhelming desire for surgery that will scotch their reproductive systems for the rest of their lives you know it's a it's a it's rightly decried to be a heinous thing when the government sterilizes or the chinese government sterilizes you know huge groups of women well it's a far sneakier thing when instagram does it through you know contagious gender dysphoria um and well there is structural evil but you know we don't see you know we don't see gangs of you know 15 year old teenage girls tearing up main street over instagram but it's happening but nobody will recognize it it's almost like a stockholm syndrome of um social media yeah we're being held host a lot of people are being held hostage but they can't really get away but now they like it you know well and something uh what her name abigail right she what she was saying is that it's not just a social media movement it's now getting it's feeding into the medical system where doctors don't want to bring up some of these issues that are happening what the trade-offs to puberty puberty blockers and these parents who put their young kids on puberty blockers were never told the the trade-offs and they thought they were doing the right things and you know you see that you see that with that issue but i think you're seeing the impact of social media and this sort of stockholm syndrome in in regular media too and barry weiss just wrote a resignation letter from the new york the new yorker i think and talking about yeah uh yeah it's either new yorker or the new york times i can't remember but um basically she was saying she was resigning because she felt like she could be the journalist that she was supposed to be and she was getting in closed doors leadership telling her you're so brave but wouldn't wouldn't stand up for her in front of the masses of young journalists who were holding on to these social justice um ideas and you know essentially bullying in a way on you know corporate social media platforms and levels and you know attacking her on twitter and she's like i won't be a part of it anymore so it's yeah it just has real life impacts outside of just this world online unfortunately it's gotten even worse than that it's gotten kind of institutional because i just uh and shared on twitter uh horrifying story of uh this boy that was in a juvenile detention facility and they forced him to have estrogen um like forced like he said like the the guard said you can't can't refuse this treatment and he was afraid because like he he has he he hadn't gone through like one of the processes or uh for um or his evaluation or whatever and it would it would give him a bad mark if he started being belligerent so he just went with it it's changed him forever he's he's gotta have surgery to he for for mammary growth and it's it's messed with his brain father said that like he he does nothing but stay in his room and was never like that before and it's if i can come in here i i think one aspect of social media which leads to these extreme pieces how the system is laid out in regards to once you're in a group in the social your platform you're in that group and you don't see anything else from any other group let's say i'm a very i watch ben shapiro the first time i'm on youtube the algorithm now is only going to see me in superior clips yep i think that's a big problem with structure that i like to hear your thoughts on that paul yeah someone someone who'd been on my channel he was you know he got into christianity a bunch of things changed about his life and he he was asking he noted that in some ways a lot of his old bad habits that he's trying to put behind him he the algorithms of these platforms keep pulling him back to places he didn't want to go i told him you know delete your account start a new gmail account and start liking you know you have to retrain the algorithm to go out there and find the kinds of videos that are going to direct you in the way your life you want to see your life go you need to you basically need to make the algorithm your slave instead of your master but that's going to take some discipline on your own part in terms of what you watch because once you start watching this other thing i mean how many of us i mean most of you found me by the algorithm because you watched jordan peterson and then i popped up and you know same thing for me and and there are times when i sit and think how much agency have i lost by my participation on social media yeah well yeah you can go no go go andrew i was just going to mention that like i've noticed that change because i have two gmails one for my university and one for just like my personal and the difference between the two is very it's not like totally drastic but i end up with more more of you all and it's just it's such a strange difference though yeah i think one of the main advantages i've always done myself is i've kind of tried to be as kind of anonymous as i can on the internet not for like for my own reason i don't know who i am or anything like that but just because then you don't get all of this tracking crap that comes along with it and this is one of the reasons why a lot of the times i when i queued my web browser going incognito mode or private mode a lot because then there's no cookies that are being tracked and then they don't follow a lot what i'm doing and usually i also get a lot of random stuff stuff that i don't even follow because i do that process it's annoying because then you've got no history you've got no things you have to type in your passwords every single time but it's less tracking in that regard at the beginning of this conversation i brought you up bill yeah hello hi it's it's this weird situation where some of the problems that are being caused by this stuff is people continuing to remain anonymous when maybe more people need to come out and stand against some of the the negative things that are happening but on the other hand there's a whole other issue where a lot of these issues are are coming from people going out and saying exactly what they think and it's biting them in the end so there's these trade-offs of both of these lifestyles and like you have to find a way to hold these two extremes it's a problem if i if the individualists all speak up individually then everyone will be destroyed the individualists would have to coordinate and then talk all at the same time the if i want to go back to sort of the the analogy of the lecture hall it's almost like especially with when paul brought up the the sneakiness of the of just social media in general with especially instagram it's almost like the the sneakiness or not the the lack of sneakiness from the chinese government they they got shut down by the professor they're like no leave leave the lecture hall but then the then instagram crept up behind the in the back of the lecture hall and back stabbed the the professor and everyone's just in shock now so the individualists are in shock they're like oh my gosh what just happened and and it's almost like um yeah it's the sneakiness in the back step so another question i would uh say is in reaction to what has just said about in you speak your mind it always seems to you in the butt in this culture and and that that runs counter to William Pearson's central idea that best way to face chaos is with truth which it seems that in this environment um don't get the best outcome thing that i would ask this question is it good do that in regards to the outcome or receive or is it something is it something physical you will receive from god in age to come yeah that's that's that's where the the difference between a secular and a christian perspective takes hold because in a secular context you might say okay to speak my mind at this point to or at least to advocate an unpopular position at this point what will this what outcome will this get me well it's probably fairly predictable well this is going to get you ostracized from this community you're going to lose status um people are going to avoid you or they're going to actively marginalize you if you have a perspective that includes a just judge at the end of time and some degree of restoration or reward then suddenly you have an incentive to speak your mind here and now even though it might cost you your life and again that stands at the heart of christianity and i think if you look at the history of western civilization part of the reason the west has been so successful is because we have a culture where you can break the narrative you you quite likely will suffer for it in the here and now but the life of the age to come is leveraged in a way that creates sort of where we began with this conversation open dialogue now you might be wrong and your idea might be bad but a society is is generally better speaking if counter narrative arguments and i think this is part of what's that you know what the idw is about counter narrative arguments can get their day out in the sunshine for people to see because over the long term and again peterson i thought was good at this most of what we think and say is wrong how do we figure out what's wrong and what's not wrong well by putting it out there and by kicking it around kind of like a soccer ball and and figuring it out and taking a look at it and hopefully over time more minds are better than fewer minds um over the long run truth will come out because it's the most durable so i think i think that's an excellent point all right and we're about five minutes from the end of our scheduled recording so i think it's a good time to say any last words about the subject i think i'm done okay g oh i don't know it's just kind of gotten to the point where something something is going to happen outside of social media that is going to put social media into more perspective and uh crazier things get more violent that action is going to seem because what paul said was that you know anger here grabs people's attention because it's a prelude to violence and well we see a lot of elements right now but it's it's the same kind of violence we've seen before that adams brought up that if you in through the riots in the 60s this is nothing new this is this has happened before and it looks the same and it's going to blow over oh well in perspective of somebody who's been through that before it's like okay that makes sense but at brings the question of what's this what's this greater what's this greater violent what's this greater anger going towards and um fuller saying that there's going to be some kind of war and that is terrifying at the same time folks have also been bringing up that if there is anything that unifies it's an external threat and so i i'm just i'm just hoping it doesn't have to i'm hoping that the thing that brings us together these days isn't going to be world war three because because currently you know china's being belligerent and they're they're annoying us uh the uk and russia and somebody said wow that sounds like the band getting back together like well and and they happen to be encroaching in the same way as germany and putting people in camps it's just like this sounds like it sounds like a thing we've heard before and and you know if you look at brought up i brought up a couple of analogies a while back called one's called the straight spring it brings in that that thing that mark twain said that history doesn't repeat it rhymes and and with people bringing up that these riots look like the 60s okay well that means that that's going to blow over but if you're going to bring up the same subject and saying wow this escalation looks like world war two that's not good i was reading this morning i've uh i'm going through one of these great courses on the history of religion in america and in the 1850s there was rioting in new york city anti-catholic rioting rioting because the it was very interesting reading all the the protestant propaganda against the catholics and you know churches roman catholic churches were burned roman catholic schools were burned people were killed um then some catholics decided to take up arms to try to protect their churches and then the mayor of philadelphia that had a larger catholic population basically wrote the mayor of new york and said you know if catholics keep getting killed in your city we're going to have an army of catholics from philadelphia come to new york city and tear up your town and now you know today we would think you know gosh you know what what if the you know what if the oh i'm trying to think what if the mayor of i'm trying to think of a blue and a red city that are close enough to you know what if the mayor of baltimore said to the mayor of camden you know if you don't get your act together you know we're gonna we're gonna send our gang bangers over and you know tear up camden even worse just you know it's just crazy um there was you know when you look at the the massacre of mormons in missouri um it was it was the missouri militia that massacred the mormons you know and the militias were kind of these state armies because the states were much more states rather than these things we have today so but your your point kevin is exactly right these these tipping points sometimes become here's a flare up and then they subside but every now and then the flare up just keeps taking momentum as in nazi germany and you know occupies the whole the whole nation and and just levels up on an international basis and let's pray that that doesn't happen so but but at the same time the kinds of conflicts we're seeing are regular and they come over religion they come over race they come over economic class you know the the beginning of the french revolution you know hungry women stormed versailles you know this was a riot of women and um so so this is we're human beings this is what we do and problem is social media continues to monkey with our um our sense making structures so all right shall i end the recording i i think so okay and then real quick uh i i wanted to i wanted to ask paul something that that was asked on the on the uh questions um say a kind of a light-hearted um outro you're you're sitting around a fire with george mcdonald leo tolstoy and abraham lincoln you are charged with the responsibility of sparking a conversation that will be live streamed go and ask how the world to see and hear conversation is centered around three questions what questions would you ask why oh gosh i can't answer that off the top of my head you know partly because well i don't know enough about mcdonald really i i read tolstoy's confession and really enjoyed the book lincoln lincoln such an interesting brilliant fascinating man i've read multiple biographies of lincoln i i would i would focus on lincoln just because i'm more interested in lincoln than i am the other two and what would you ask him about lincoln i don't know i i i would probably ask him about his wife about what it what it was like to um how on earth did he manage to continue to lead the country during the midst of a civil war while his wife was going mad and he lost a son i mean you look at you look at what that man did with what he faced in his private life it's truly amazing and then and then you get to you know the second inaugural or or the getty's burg address these tiny little speeches that are just that are just phenomenally brilliant and this out of a guy who you know sort of comes out of you know comes out of nowhere in some ways lincoln man what a what a figure in american history and then to have him assassinated i mean because if you thought in some ways a war is easy to prosecute kill the enemy the real challenge was reconstruction and so to i mean to have the the course of american history with respect to race and so many other things would have been dramatically different if the united states had had a president continued to have a president like lincoln instead of andrew johnson who you know it's it's it's just a phenomenal phenomenal story the the story of the american civil war of abraham lincoln and then you know andrew johnson and then and then ulysses s grant you know again we have we have anxiety about our current age we have nuclear weapons we have you know a pandemic fair enough things are scary but the the to me the gaping the gaping hole in the imagined representation of the idw is the lack of historians because good grief look at look at what the nation and human beings have survived in the past it ain't pretty but what we're dealing with now i mean even compared to life in the third world you know the lights are on cops don't pull you over to shake you down that the even the even the numbers of americans killed by police now as compared to what they were in the 1970s you know you know i i have my criticisms of steven pinker but he's got a point and um life for many of us is secure affluent comfortable the opportunities we have are compared to the vast majority of human beings throughout human history the the opportunities we have are amazing we are we are whiny and pathetic compared to so many other human beings so i don't know what to do with lincoln tolstoy and george mcdonald what what a trio only someone only this discord server could come up with with that trio maybe that's a good way to end sound good it sounds good to me all right i'll stop recording and we can do some debriefing
