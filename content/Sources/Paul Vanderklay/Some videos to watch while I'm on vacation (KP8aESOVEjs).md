 Hi, this is Paul. I wanted to just make a little YouTube today I am going to be on vacation next week and I will I don't know if I'll be making any videos I'm going to be prioritizing time with my wife and my children next week. And so if something allows me to make a video or if I get a Thought or a comment and I just pull out my cell phone and I make a tiny little video like I've done on vacation before Maybe I will or maybe my channel will go silent next week. I don't know yet But so I'm gonna be on vacation next week. So if you send me an email next week They're gonna pile up and they might get lost So you might want to wait a little while before you send me an email anyway, there were just a bunch of really interesting videos that I've been watching and This is a bunch of videos that aren't from Jordan Peterson, but they're from other people Ian McGill-christ Made a video with Jordan Peterson, which was very interesting and then someone sent me this video and I watched it and I thoroughly Enjoyed it. I'll give you just a little taste for it and it very much Impacts the entire Jordan Peterson Sam Harris conversation. So let me just play a little bit worse In the medical world in the scientific world we prize a certain kind of thinking because we believe it can discover the truth Now if the world only comes into being because of the way we attend to it There can't be a single truth from which to start and reason can't help us here reason is a consistency tool That's all it is. It just means that if you start with certain premises, it can tell you what is consistent with it What it can't tell you is whether you started from the right premises It can't also tell you why you're going to use reasons. We have to intuit that we can't reason to that and Indeed the consequences of our thinking the consequences of our reasoning aren't Just bald facts they exist in the context of persons and lives and the home very complex animate world and so at the end of the day the Understanding of what we have discovered by reason has to be done by Calling on judgments and values and things that come from experience So there isn't actually it is an illusion that there is certainty and indeed I think many of the awful things about the world at the moment come from people who believe that they have access to a certain truth whether that is a fundamentalist religious people or fundamentalist atheists So the whole video is really very good I'll play a little bit more about genetics here towards the end You know, I'd love to just play the whole thing and put it on YouTube, but that violates I don't want to violate that you can just go to Vimeo I'll leave the link in the whole thing is really helpful in terms of the Peterson Harris conversation He can't find the duck. Well, it's a bit the same with genetics There's just not enough information there for a start. So the same gene packs six which Codes for your eye also codes for a frog's eye and a fly's eye They're very different eyes and the difference comes from the way the gene acts in context and Of course, that's true. Absolutely everything in life It's true of poetry when you take the meaning out of the context it dies music is entirely context physics is in fact Entirely context because it's about the relations between particles whose existence we hardly know We can't be certain about and it's in the patterns It's in the relationships and indeed our lives are patterns and relationships and that as somebody commented earlier is where Meaning comes in this world and I'd like to gloss the remark science doesn't take away meaning absolutely true But it can't give meaning either. It's neutral in that respect When somebody has a brain insult or injury It's not just like a component in the washing machine going a wolf the whole vastly complex multi-recursive system of the human mind is altered and There are many things as I say that can't be If you change the context change profoundly their nature Some aspects of humans such as their limbs are rather like parts of a machine For the simple reason that machines were made by humans to achieve many of the tasks that human limbs hitherto fulfilled Other than that even a single cell is an unimaginably complex Self-regulating and self replicating entity carrying out thousands of operations simultaneously that are Complexly recursive in effect and which communicates with and responds to millions of other cells of its own and of other kinds We Were worried about being able to model the human mind and a distinguished scientist at UCL and commented on a project where somebody was being offered money to Allow some of money to model the human mind and he said well We might do well if he could first model the nematode, which is a tiny worm. We can't do that So we probably not going to be able to succeed in this project Everything in the body is not Serial and mechanical it's not like relays of messages everything feeds back When you send a message out another one comes back as indeed from the heart as discussed earlier And here's Marcel Kinsborne on Neurons Marcel Kinsborne very great Anglo-American neuroscientist Counter to the traditional image of the brain as unidirectional information thoroughfare When cell stations in the brain connect the traffic is almost always bidirectional The traffic's not in one direction with a little feedback either areas interact equally in both directions Directly reciprocally or indirectly by looping across several cell stations so that the neural traffic reverberates through its starting point So We are not going to find it easy to model ourselves when we can hardly model such circuitry We don't know how to predict the outcomes of such complex interactions So there is there are limits to what science can tell us it is a wonderful tool It is a wonderful servant, but it should never become the master And the problem is that people become very distinguished in ethicists or astronomers and they think that this means that it gives them Some special gift that allows them to say whether God exists or what a human being is Or what kind of a thing the world is I'm afraid those are questions It's no disrespect to science to say science can't answer their questions for philosophy Our genes are puppet masters Well again metaphors are the only way in which we understand and science is particularly Metaphorical and it does rather matter which gene which metaphors you use so if you think of genes are selfish So if you think of genes are selfish you see one thing stand forward if you realize that in fact Competition is a very important part of evolution, but just as important is cooperation You you wouldn't be able to evolve without competition or without cooperation and we couldn't function without a degree of cooperation and competition so The model that you choose Tells you very much and I was dismayed when I saw a very distinguished Oxford biologist on television giving the I think the Royal Institution lectures to Children anyway, the whole video is very much worth watching and so check it out Another video Neil deGrasse Tyson and one of one of my meetups members brought this one forward now Neil deGrasse Tyson is an interesting guy because he's you can find plenty of YouTube clips where he Dismisses religion, let's say well what's fascinating about this conversation that he has with Robert Krowich Robert Krowich Was one of is one of the founders of radio labs, which is an older podcast. That's done some really excellent work and Neil deGrasse Tyson goes walks through basic operations of Looking at dimensions and how dimensions are are different and he's a little annoying in this because he keeps calling the fourth dimensions like another Another dimension with the fourth dimension is time. We know that and And that's important in terms of trying to figure out reality. So something that is true in four dimensions is more Some a lot of the thinking I've been doing lately it gets into this question. I'm working on trying to get language about reality because the The When you listen to Sam Harris talk and Matt Dillahunty They often treat reality as if it's a it's functionally binary It's something is real or not real Whereas reality seems far more complex than that and that's part of the difficulty that they're having when they talk about reality, so then when they talk about reality without without a Describer Then it's or without an adjective then well, that's just reality. That's like facts and Amazon boxes But then there's metaphorical reality or metaphorical truth and some of these things and that's that's just I think a very bad way to Approach this entire conversation It could be that we could talk about hierarchies of reality that might be a better way to discuss what reality is and That it within hierarchies of reality those things which colonize other realities are higher realities or stronger realities or more real and and so You get into this question of realities It gets complicated and in this in this video Neil deGrasse Tyson goes through some basic things about Dimensions one dimension two dimensions three dimensions the fourth dimension which is time and then additional dimensions and he begins He begins to think about the fact that Mathematically we can project into other dimensions, but by virtue of How we have developed We cannot interact with these dimensions as such. In fact, we in this moment interact fairly well with three dimensional space but we When you think about the relationship between consciousness Consciousness and the fourth dimension which is time then suddenly memory gets involved And if you go all the way back to the beginning of this video with Neil deGrasse Tyson, there are a lot of issues I don't think he speaks well in the beginning of this. I think he speaks rather rather in cautiously and unclearly when he talks about What is reality and personal testimony being Having the weaknesses that it does but when we get into the fourth dimension then absolutely we have to deal with time because Consciousness is always in a sense the now and then memory comes in and that helps us deal with the fourth dimension But once you start adding further dimensions, we are simply out of our league which brings Neil deGrasse Tyson to this conclusion Reader door. Oh, you just derived the fundamental law of calculus. Isn't that cute put it up on the refrigerator Their simplest thoughts would transcend our deepest thoughts. This would be Beings that can see more de vent that can see See again There's there's a metaphor because would they be seeing it in the way we see it even and even whenever we use the term C we're talking about this we're building out a metaphor and again the the McGillquist video talks in some very helpful ways about How dependent we are on metaphor as the C is Lewis and miracles But when we when we see this way, we're not even realizing we're using a metaphor Because what would say a being that can engage an additional dimension like a tesseract beyond us How would we relate to that kind of being and how would that kind of being See us when the go-krist makes the point that we have as many neurons in our gut as a dog's brain Has okay and we can't even we can't even model a worm We don't know enough about how worms How the nervous system of a worm behaves that we can model a worm, okay This is how inept we are and how little we know And so now neil degrasse tyson is just talking dimensions And maybe they to them it is obvious what dark matter is and dark energy maybe to them Particles popping in and out of existence is a trivial exercise in their understanding of the multidimensional space-time continuum and we are here groping at the sides of a wall not knowing how tall Wide or deep it is because we have the limits of the human physiology Evolved off the plains of africa just to try to understand the entire universe So I lose sleep on that question each night So that's my wait, but did you almost say at the beginning of that answer that you are Wondering maybe something of a mysterious that you that you you're not sure I'm not sure the world is so the universe is so complicated that it may be more complicated than we can ever fathom No, that's the hubristic way to say it. That's not how I said it Okay, how did you say it again we might not be smart enough Okay, not hubristic if you're hubristic you would say we are smart but the universe is just really complicated That's not what I said. I said we might not be smart enough to figure out a universe that could be trivial To the brain of a more intelligent species So check your hubris at the door. Otherwise You're you will not bask in the cosmic perspective that so much of this discussion brings upon us so May I now give you my compound answer my compound answer is I think often about the questions We do not yet know to ask because discoveries Yet to come But when they arrive will put us in a new vista a new place to stand enabling us to see questions undreamt of and unimagined before we got there So when I again lay awake at night, I ponder what kinds of questions Lay beyond our reach Because the questions that we even know how to pose They're there Those are not even interesting to me anymore because we knew how to ask the question I want to know the question That is beyond everyone's reach And by definition, I can't because we haven't gotten there yet, but that doesn't mean I I shouldn't dream Of that frontier Now I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I
