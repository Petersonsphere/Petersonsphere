 I don't know everybody comments that pastors are always sitting in front of books. So well you know man in this day and age there's so many ways to consume content. Most people say things like I'm an audible guy. I'm a podcast guy a YouTube guy and I'm still an old fashioned book guy. There's nothing like the written word on the printed page and I can hold a paperback or hardcover in my hand like I'll use Kindle for stuff I can't easily access but yeah I love books man. Kindle is awfully tempting when you want that book now and it's just like bang it's right there. Well TK thanks for thanks for being on my channel and I I learned about you on Twitter a couple days ago. Kind of the height of the drama. You know I've listened to Glenn Lowry and John McWhorter for a long time and I mentioned them on Twitter and someone said you got to listen to TK Coleman too and I thought I'd never heard of you. So and then message you and I want you to come on my channel so I can meet you and get to know you and you graciously did. So I don't know how many of the people who watch my channel know anything about you. So let's let's start with you and then you can ask me questions about me because you don't know me either. But let's let's start with you. So yeah so first of all you mentioned John McWhorter and Glenn Lowry I've spent a lot of hours listening to those guys especially McWhorter. I mean what a what a brilliant thinker. What a great philosopher of our times. And he's had a lot of interesting things to say about language about culture about race that I think is worth anybody's time listening to. I think one of the great tragedies of our age is we only expose ourselves to thinkers that reinforce what we already believe and feel. And it's so great to go outside of your familiar spaces and just engage great minds because learning how to think more effectively is just as valuable as you know hearing another way to explain what you already think you know. And McWhorter is one of those guys where on a lot of things politically I differ from him but every single time I listen to him I absolutely enjoy the experience and I walk away feeling like my IQ is a little higher. Yeah. Shout out to both of those guys and I would love someday to be able to talk to Glenn and John on race and be a part of that conversation. A little bit about me to answer your questions. Well more than a little bit. We've got time and on my channel I do a lot of conversations as they say on my channel with randos and just today I've had conversations with two guys that you know that I don't know in neat space and regular space. I have an open channel on my line basically that if anybody wants to talk to me if they can find a slot they could just sign up and we'll have a conversation and often I post them. So we're used to my channel loves people's stories. So tell me about growing up and who your parents were and what growing up was like for you. We'll start there and we'll take it from there. Yeah. So I'm the baby boy of a family of five in Chicago and my dad is a pastor. So I am TK the PK. I grew up in the church. My pops church was a Pentecostal all black church on the west side inner city Chicago initially started off as one of those like storefront churches you know and is now a much larger church on a major intersection in Chicago Washington and Cicero. And I grew up with a couple of fundamental assumptions that that have remained with me throughout my life. The first is you are here for a purpose and your number one job is to discern what that is and to to to embark on a journey of always refining and upgrading your understanding of what that is so that you can make a difference in the world according to God's calling on your life and all of the fulfillment that we chase and status in things and money all of that's gravy on the mashed potatoes man. But the purpose the reason for your existence that is really what it's all about. I remember hearing Dr. Miles Monroe once say that the root of man's frustrations is his misconception of self when we don't know who we are and why we are here how we have each been called individually to be the image and likeness of God on the earth and to represent some aspect of his kingdom nothing else can satisfy you you know. And so I was taught that very early on the second thing that was drilled into us is the understanding that work is distinct from a job and ideally you want to figure out a way to marriage the two if you can but you never want to limit your understanding of work to a job no matter how much you might hate your job or be bored by your job your work is your opportunity to give creative expression to the divine you know it's through the brilliance of humanity that we give glory to God work is one of the primary means by which we worship and so I've always prioritized those two things like anybody that grew up in the church you know my journey it was not a linear one you had a lot of little deviations from the path. But as the scriptures say raise up a child in the way that he should go when he's not when he's older he will not depart from it. And I think that's true of me albeit in a roundabout way. So you know when you grew up in the church especially in like a black Pentecostal church it's like everybody's an extension of your family. I've got aunts and cousins and uncles that have no you know blood relation to me but they look out for me we look out for them it's like family. I grew up in a context where I was often in the car with my pop or you know at a restaurant with my pop and other preachers and I have a very positive image of older men in my life who really looked out for my brothers and I and sowed the seeds of moral reasoning. Sowed the seeds of spiritual philosophy into our hearts and I was just always taught to take those things seriously which doesn't mean you can't have a sense of humor about yourself as you contemplate those things. So that's how I grew up. I would say when I you know in high school I fell in love with theater. I went to college on a theater scholarship and I grew up in a really conservative home not politically but culturally speaking. I can get into kind of like the political environment in a moment but culturally very conservative we didn't listen to secular music we weren't allowed to go to the movies and man if it wasn't explicitly about Jesus it wasn't happening in our home it just wasn't happening. You know my mom just had preachers like Moody Bible radio plan 24 7. It just wasn't going down in the common house if it wasn't the Bible like you brought a book in the home it's like how many scriptures in that book you know it was no joke and so when I got to college I mean I'm exposed to an unprecedented amount of cultural diversity of religious diversity philosophical diversity and it sent me into a kind of crisis of faith if you will and you know a lot of the questions that my friends would ask became my own. I remember plugging into some communities like InterVarsity Christian Fellowship Campus Crusade for Christ and one of the things that they were doing at that time is they would go out on the campus and they would minister to people and I would see these atheists and skeptics ask questions and I remember being really unsatisfied with the answers that were being given and I felt like I was relating more to the questions than the quality of the answers and those questions became internalized and so I remember this pivotal summer I'm at home I've got a brother who is going to Trinity at this time and he's now a pastor but he used to always keep great books in his room and I would always find good reading material and I remember he had this stack of articles on his desk and they were from Ravi Zacharias International Ministries and the name of the articles were called Just Thinking and the one on top said The Logic of Sesame Street and I read that and I was like whoa that particular article wasn't written by Ravi it was somebody in his camp but then the next one was by Ravi and I couldn't stop man and I kept reading everything and when I finished I felt like these scales had fallen off my eyes and I said whatever you call this this is where I want to be and so I remember going back to school I had been a theater major at that up to that point and I go back to school and I go straight to the philosophy department because I'm thinking I gotta be in an environment where I can be at home asking questions and nobody will be intimidated or annoyed by my doubts because not to throw believers under the bus but at least 20 years ago you go around asking apologetic questions the culture was very different now like apologetics has gone mainstream but then people would be like ah be careful be careful with those questions right and the philosophy department represented a space where I could go and whether my teacher was atheist or theist they were just happy to talk about it and so I go to the chairman and I said I want to major in philosophy he says have you taken any classes and I said no but you know I'm good I'm ready to do this and he says well usually people want to kind of take a course first see if they like it and then they study it you know declaring a major is a big thing and I said no no I read the Ravi Zakariya's articles I know this is what I wanted to do he let me do it man he let me study philosophy um I and there was a man in that department Dr. Timothy McGrew who became a good friend and a mentor of mine I wish I talked to him more but Tim McGrew is just like a ridiculously great philosopher who also happened to be a Christian and was just a great source of conversation in my life and helping me shape my worldview and so forth and I can go on and on but I've already talked too much no you haven't you trust me I have a channel where I talk for hours all about myself so don't worry about that and if I want to redirect you I'm I grew up in Patterson New Jersey I have no problem buttoning and redirecting you so you're you're doing great so so what school did you go to? Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo Kalamazoo Michigan yeah so I went to Calvin College in Grand Rapids so I oh yeah small world yeah it's a small world but my wife is from Grand Rapids area yep okay okay so you went to Western Michigan you got a philosophy degree what happened after college? Man you know the hardest part about telling this story is everything I tell you there's like five or different choose your own adventure paths yeah yeah that that gives you a completely different picture of my life and I'm like oh gosh which which path do I want to go down because it's not a linear journey at all a linear it's not a linear journey at all well we're sitting here and you graduate college just find just we'll find our way from one point to the other so keep going yeah you know obviously I let me tell you a little bit about myself yeah so that might help you yeah that'll help so oh gosh see I have the same problem um so I'm a third generation knowing where to start yeah I'm a third generation minister in the Christian Reformed Church now being from Kalamazoo Michigan you probably have an idea what the Christian Reformed Church is okay so Western Michigan you you bump into the Christian Reformed Church in Chicago, Western Michigan not so much other places in the country because my my so my mother's family came came over with the cows to Massachusetts that they're Frisians don't worry about that but my father's side of the family were Jews who went to Western Michigan and mingled in with the Dutch reform towards the end of the 19th century so then my grandfather became a minister in the Christian Reformed Church and ministered throughout the Midwest mostly with my father growing up my father was his eldest son and then my father my father um went to Calvin College um because that's what you did if you were Christian Reformed went to Calvin College and eventually to Calvin's seminary and then after seminary he had met my mother in college and she was from the East Coast and he had two um he had two in the CRC we call them calls basically two job offers one was from northern Alberta and the other from Patterson New Jersey and so this is this is 1959 1960 now you've you've read The Warmth of Other Suns I haven't oh you should it's an amazing book it's basically about the African American migration up from the deep south out to New York, Chicago, LA, must read book it's a phenomenal book and say this one more time The Warmth of Other Suns okay got it and you know I read that book about three four years ago and because of the story I'm about to tell you suddenly big pieces of my life made sense because I grew up in Patterson and of course when you grow up into something you don't know what's weird because it's all you know and I grew up and my father was pastoring this church which was mostly full of black folks from the poor area of Patterson New Jersey but I obviously wasn't black and but I didn't know that because you just grow up thinking you're what you are with who you are but and so then we went to day school with all the CRC folks in their Christian school but then we lived and church life was all amongst the black folks in Patterson well you know a whole bunch of stuff so that was my growing up years and so I was always sort of straddled to communities and then I went to Calvin College and I went to Calvin Seminary and I became a missionary in the Dominican Republic did that I never wanted to be a local pastor then we left the Dominican Republic and it's like what am I going to do and I could pastor I know how to do that I watched so then I came to Sacramento California I've been here for 22 years and it's a very it's a very diverse congregation in I mean you know in in the east we call the inner city but in California it's always the rings because California cities grow by these rings and so this area of town was one of the first places after redlining where black folks could buy houses and so this congregation was started about the same time my father's congregation was started and that was sort of second wave anti-racism and you know Dr. King was very much the the leader of the movement and it was it was very much integration where you'd have my father got there sort of before that consciousness and it had been in the 50s kind of a the CRC the white Dutch CRC churches had moved out of Patterson because they were in you know the suburbanization effect and but some of them were like you know a lot of these people living here they're struggling they're suffering we can't just you know what certainly we owe we owe our neighbors something and so then they had one of these old style gospel mission you know giving away food and all this kind of stuff and they did that for a decade or two then it's like this this should really be a church and not this dependent thing so they called my father who when I think about it knew nothing about black folks to Patterson and he stayed there for 36 years and so that was me growing up in this church which was you know it was weird because on one hand it was sort of Dutch Calvinist because that was my father but most of the folks were black and so it was always an alternative it was an alternative to the black church because there were plenty of those churches around if folks wanted to go to it and so for the black folks it was an alternative and for the white folks well there are plenty of those churches they could go to but they wanted this vision of integration and living together and becoming one body and and so that was but of course when you grow up in it it's just like isn't everything like this and of course later on you learn that it isn't so anyway so that's what I've done for most of my life but then Jordan Peterson came along and I've always been interested in things and I was interested in the stuff that was going on around Jordan Peterson not so much the political stuff much more the religious stuff because I saw people becoming interested in Christianity when I'd seen so many people become sort of new age or atheist or something like that and not come back and then in sort of in Jordan Peterson's wake people started coming back and I made a video a couple videos commenting on Jordan Peterson's work and suddenly I had people watching my YouTube channel which wasn't happening before so and that's how the YouTube channel started and and so all of this stuff and of course I you know so I was I was very much raised and again what we'll use John McWhorter's language second wave anti-racism Dr. King I was I mean that was that was that was it that and and so so then I you know I'm watching some of this stuff develop and it didn't start so much with the race racial reconciliation conversations it came about more with the the gender stuff and I began listening to people in my denomination talking about this and I began to say you know I'm this this this is sounding like a different a different mode of salvation that's going on here and so and and so then you know early on I found the blogging head the black guys at tv Glenn Lowry and I knew nothing about him and I had I had read one book by John McWhorter so I knew something about him and I listened to these guys talk and I thought wow I haven't I I don't hear so many of the conversations I was listening to it'd be like yeah you know and as a Calvinist you know to me thoughts like you know the racism built into me and the how the racism gets into systems none of that surprised me I I didn't have and growing up where I did that was all easy to see I know that that that everyone's got racism and that racism gets into our institutions it gets perpetuated none of that was news to me I thought yeah I I get that yeah yeah the hard questions are well you know what then and I I wasn't finding conversations like I heard so Glenn and John sort of speak from different sides of the political equation but they're both honest and you know honest about just honest about so much and honest to me about the black experience and I wasn't hearing that and and it wasn't new to me because I'd lived all my life around it and I I'd seen a version of it in the Caribbean which was very different but still you know still racism and structures and all that stuff is perpetuating between Haitians and Dominicans and so I watch all this stuff and I'm thinking I don't hear any except in the church but but again I mean part of what's happened and see a lot of my channel I deal with I deal with in a sense the march of secularity you know the black church has you know been undergoing a lot of changes too and so finally you know when I when I listened to Lowry and McWhorter I thought these are two guys I want to listen to regularly because that they're being honest about they're being honest about what I can see is is all sides of the issue instead of you know I listen to some of these people and I think these people on one hand are declaring that that that racism is permanent and systemic and I say yeah as a Calvinist I agree to that and so the answer is for these white people to do things to save them and it's like did you hear the first part of your equation when you listen to the second and I'm not I don't I know that white folks have to do stuff too I get that but McWhorter says it the best you know why why are African Americans the only people in the history of the world that somehow can't overcome a situation of adversity and when I hear that having grown up the way I did and so my father's ministry so often we had a heroin was going through Patterson at the time and so you know walking through getting free of drugs with heroin addicts and of course you know a whole new level of of racial conversation consciousness was happening and living with people as they're working through okay what does it mean to be black in this country and if you just read the well-documented writings of the civil rights movement there are multiple voices working on these issues and and now people like I'm not going to read a book I think this and bang it's like no read learn you know get in touch with you so anyway you got me preaching I'm so sorry I talked to you see what I mean about long speeches so you can't man this is not more no this is this is good stuff that there's a lot of good conversational fodder here so one thing I want to say about the whole thing of of the solution like like you know I think I don't know how you worded it but it was something along the lines of like oh just like apologize or something like that I don't know what it was but one of the things that it makes me think about is is is this idea that when you when you when you get redemption wrong you also get repentance wrong when you don't when you don't have clear ideas about what it means to be redeemed then you can't have good ideas about what it means to repent you know so one example of this that we see in the scriptures is you know when when the Pharisees bring the adulteress to Jesus right and they you know they said hey look the law says she should be stoned to death and they were very illogical in their thinking you could argue and and and by the way you know she was not you know the highest member of society she's certainly no one we should be holding up you know as any kind of you know beacon of of meaning you know and yet we do we talk about this adulteress because she's a very important symbol of something very special near near to God's heart but Jesus challenges them right he challenges them and you know in that challenge we understand the real nature of their error because these guys didn't understand grace because they didn't understand what the message of redemption was all about they couldn't get repentance right their idea of how we fix them they they diagnosed the sin problem they were right about that a law has been violated no criticism of them there but their concept of redemption was the right thing to do about this is to stone her to death and the reason they thought that was a good idea was because they were completely disconnected from God's ideas from God's vision of what he ultimately wanted to do with not only this adulteress but with every human heart right and and that's the difference between the Christian worldview and the world you know the world is a cancel culture Christianity is a compassion culture and those those those are two totally different ends in the world the reason we call you out on your sin is because first of all it's it's really fun to do so secondly it's it gives you a lot of power right uh there's nothing more powerful than the sensation of pulling somebody down but also you know when our anger is heightened as a result of seeing something done wrong it kind of feels satiating to call you out and to cancel you and now you're done and I can move on to whoever and what else whatever else needs to be canceled and I understand that I'm very empathetic towards that and I don't intend to mock it but we have to be honest about the fact that that is a different aim than the Christian worldview and you can disagree with the Christian worldview you can say well you know what I'll accept that as an argument that your worldview is foolish and and that would be understandable too but the Christian worldview says God's ultimate end for every human being is not to cancel them because of their sin but to redeem them can you imagine if the apostle Paul who was the chief of all sinners was canceled if anybody deserved to be canceled it was him right but the purpose of rebuke the purpose of calling someone out on their sin is because you understand all men have sinned all people have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God it's the glory that we have fallen short of that makes sin such a tragedy we were meant for glory we were meant to be these beautiful brilliant shining lights so that people might see our good works and glorify our father in heaven and as long as the clock is ticking as long as we are alive there's room for that you know and if we have an opportunity to bring someone into the fold who has a powerful testimony like Paul saying I was the chief of all sinners but now I'm laying down my life for the message of the gospel that's awesome that's a major victory for the world right but but we fall short of that because we don't understand Jesus's message and we see it illustrated in the Pharisees with the adulterous and we also see it illustrated in discussions today on politics and race we don't understand the message of redemption and so we don't get repentance right and and and we we actually lose a lot of people by representing the gospel as if it demands a form of repentance that not only doesn't satisfy but that actually doesn't really lead to transformation either you know yeah yeah yeah that's something there was something else you said that triggered me too but I forgot what that was it could be a long video I love it I love it yeah wow wow so all right so you didn't you didn't you didn't leave college and become a preacher even though you obviously have the gifts what happened what are you doing oh man I'm fully sold on the idea that that life itself is ministry and that all of us have individual networks and that constitutes the mission field and our job is to represent that light and everything we do but in terms of what I do now oh we gotta get I don't want you to go there yeah I want to because people in my channel a lot of people who watch my channel are young and they're trying to sort themselves out and figure out so hearing other people's stories about how they get places it's really helpful so you left college and then what oh yeah sure so okay so I graduated college and here I am with a with a philosophy degree which which certainly is not well you almost had a theater degree that's a that's maybe just a little better I don't know man like like is it better to think successfully or actually man who knows anyway anyway but so I have this bachelor's degree in philosophy that's not making the top of anyone's list for most economically rewarding degrees right and you know there's certainly a path ahead where if you want to go on and get a PhD and maybe be a professor but that that wasn't on my radar I had a number of different dreams and so forth and and and as I'm as I'm a new into the real world I'm really I'm really thinking about money and I'm really trying to figure out uh-oh how am I going to be a self-sustaining adult like you know this is a big question I gotta answer and so another story about being at home in my brother's library this is my other brother I have a lot of moments of transformation that have taken place in my brother's libraries which which is a case for having you know the power of having people in your family that read you never know the impact you'll have so there was a book he had called rich dad poor dad by Robert Kiyosaki and I remember reading that book and there was something about the case that Kiyosaki made for the relationship between financial literacy and a meaningful life and he presented money not as this thing to be feared not as something that is intrinsically evil but something that is a neutral tool that can be used for good that can be used for bad depending on how you understand it the way I like to put it is I like to say the love of money is the root of all evil but a wise and understanding of its nature and purpose is the beginning of much good I came away with that kind of conviction after reading Robert Kiyosaki and there was an elder at a church I attended at that time who was a financial advisor and you know I was all hyped up with a bunch of questions about finance that you know I asked him if we could do breakfast and I would pick his brain and ask him questions we did that it was a great time he recommended some books for me to read I went and I inhaled those books and I was like can we do another breakfast you know I got more questions we did that like about for about three or four rounds and he was like hey man you got a knack for this stuff you're inhaling a lot of these books you're really intense really interested have you considered doing a career in finance I was like that sounds good because in my mind at this stage I'm still thinking that the way to make money is to learn a lot about it you know I'm still being a philosopher with you know yeah and so through some connections of his I ended up becoming a financial advisor at American Express and I did that for about a year and during that time I learned a lot about sales I learned a lot about myself I learned a lot about how to work with clients and I've got nothing negative to say about the time that I worked there but I worked hard I worked long hours I'm in my cubicle every day and there's something about being in that space that really caused a lot of old dreams to well up in my heart and as as the early 20-somethings tend to do I started to freak out that I'm gonna wake up one day and be like Rip Van Winkle my whole life will have passed me by I'm gonna all of a sudden be 80 and I'll be filled with regret I'll regret having made money and been successful but I won't have followed any dreams and that's just hilarious to me by the way like there's nothing that young people fear more than like making a bunch of money being successful and being filled with regret I like to remind them oh believe me the odds that you will have so much success and money first of all I don't even know if that's happening right like you have no idea how hard just how hard it is just to get to that point where you can have that as a regret yeah but anyway that was my fear and something that I didn't mention is you know when I left the theater as a major I still had friends in that department I would still sometimes do plays you know I would still stage manage a play or act in a play and I still had a love for that world and I just didn't graduate with a degree in it and and I would still do some things in my free time and a dream that I had to be honest with myself that I had always had was to give myself a chance to to work in in the film business and and I just love storytelling man that that was my heart I still love storytelling and I decided you know what if I stay here I'm gonna get stuck I know people are treating me well and things are going well but I got one shot to just be able to up and move across the country and do whatever I want to do without answering to anybody I don't have to have a conversation with my wife with with kids any of that stuff and I did it man it was pretty spontaneous but hey that's exactly the time to do it you did exactly right because I had so many people mad at me so yeah here's a race element I'll bring into it so we're talking we're talking almost 20 years ago and to be a young black male working for a company like American Express and to have a label financial advisor to walk into the office with a suit and tie every day that's a pretty big deal right it's a lot more common now it'd still be a big deal right now yeah but but that was a real big deal then yeah and I even remember this time there was a maintenance guy who worked in that building and sometimes I'd be there working late it's like seven seven thirty and he would be coming in during his cleaning and I had seen him a few times and we had given each other the head nod but there was one day he came up to me and he was like hey bro it's good to see you in here bro and I could see his eyes water up he was like it's just so good to see you in here bro you know and I could tell that me having this job meant something to him at a level that made him feel more hopeful about his world yeah and and I empathize with that you know what I mean and so when I quit there were a lot of people in my life that were proud of me at the time that I had that job they were proud of me and can you imagine a black guy come on now listen to me can you imagine a black dude who was able to get a job as a financial advisor at American Express he not only quits the job but to be an actor only the only thing worse was for me to quit to say I wanted to go to the NBA I mean you couldn't have picked the worst thing to do right it's like come on man like we have proven we can do that TK we've done the basketball thing we've done that and that's what I want to do I was so disappointing man I really hurt a lot of people I won't go deep into that but I had a lot of people being mad at me and so that was really tough for me that was a really tough experience oh to be perfectly honest if you were my kid wanting to do that you know I wouldn't stop you but I'd say I'll see you in six months when you're crying to me because you need a bailout but yeah yeah go do your young foolishness so anyway I'm glad you did it keep going you're doing great my father's one of my best friends in the world but but pops if you're watching this I know you're celebrating when he said that I know you're like see my kids are in their 20s that's I I know it'd be like yeah right I put my parents through man I put them through but but so so yeah I mean I actually so here's the funny thing the I didn't expect that kind of pushback I really didn't expect it I I I had a very romantic image in my mind that this would be like that that moment you see in the Hollywood movies where where someone has an epiphany while they're sitting in their cubicle and they're like my soul is dying I'm gonna live a life of meaning and passion and then everyone's like yeah man go follow your dreams and then you get an Oscar by the next 12 months it was completely opposite of that the pushback I got was hard even the girl I was dating at that time was freaking out like what are you doing it was bad and and it really intimidated me I I thought I was gonna quit and just like go to Cali and do my thing but it really intimidated me I tried to maintain a strong face at that time but secretly privately I was so intimidated and I played it safe I didn't have the guts to just go and do what I wanted to do because sometimes it's like this I think failure people fear failure but I think there's something that people fear more than that it's not it's not failure that people fear as much as being alone when it comes time to own the consequences of failure that's what people fear so if everybody supports what I do and they all co-sign it and say it's a great idea if I go do that and I fail that's disappointing but not too bad because I've got a support network of people that are ready to tell me like hey man you know not everything works in life you did the best that you can you know good job we love you now you move on to something different but when you make choices that cause everybody to be concerned and people to think you're crazy for making that choice then that means the pressure to succeed is much higher because if you fail you don't have a support network of people that are going to be like it's all good you're going to have a network of people that are just waiting to be like I told you so I told you so just like you mentioned with like yeah okay I let you do it but wait till you come crying to me in six months wait till you come crying to me but if I do something that you suggest and I still need your help in six months you're going to feel a sense of like hey you know I invest in the future I'm happy to support you and I felt that pressure and so it wasn't so much that I was afraid of failure but like I was afraid of that pressure and um and it took me a while I didn't I didn't go off I didn't go I ended up getting a job at an assisted living facility that I had spent some time working in while I was in college because since I quit my job I needed to find a way to pay the bills and I'm just kind of in in what's the word for it when you're in the uh I forget the word for it you know whatever no man's land I'll call it but but I was kind of like floating floating there and you know as I'm as I'm working there um I decide you know I think I'm going to go back to school and do philosophy I think I'm going to go to graduate school yeah I was working at this place for like a year a year and a half and through a combination of just comfort fear that that dream that made me quit that job just kind of you know settle down somewhere into my soul and I knew that what I was doing was an in the meantime in between times I've always had it in my DNA to do something that was meaningful yeah I still knew that philosophy was something I was called to do and it just seemed more reasonable to me and more accessible to me to go back to school and study philosophy so there's this amazing miraculous story I'm going to skip over when it comes to that but I ended up going back to school and I'm in graduate school for philosophy where I'm on a third uh back at western Michigan same oh yeah and and I'm on a Thurgood Marshall scholarship for philosophy there and everything seems to be it seems like okay my life is starting to make sense again uh the the adults in my life feel like I'm being a serious professional again it's like okay he had the American Express thing but he's studying philosophy he's doing cool and uh so I'm about uh almost a year in one of my buddies who lives in LA he's a working actor he he played the character U-turn on weeds he's been in a number of movies number of tv shows uh his name is Paige Kendry and uh him and I actually were in theater together and we hung out a lot we're in college it caused me one day and what I didn't tell you is I I sang as well but you can usually assume that with theater people you know so anyway um he calls me one day and he's like hey man you know that show American Idol I'm like yeah he's like well they're actually having auditions right and I just feel like if if you went to audition for this thing and other people saw what I saw I think they love you man and I think you'd have a shot at being the next American Idol and he says I think you should come out here and do this and I go nah man nah not not interested right I'm on a stable path I'm doing well can't afford to break anybody's hearts anymore I'm good so he calls me back no no I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry he told me the first version of this he told me that there that it was in like um in in Detroit or something like that which wasn't far from where I was in California yeah and uh and I was like no I'm not doing it so he calls me back again like two weeks later or something I'm probably getting my time mixed up but he says hey listen they're they're doing another round in Chicago I'm serious I think you really got to do this and I'm like nah man he hits me up again a little bit later and says look they're doing this in San Jose I've been talking with Marcus about this who's another friend and he says Marcus and I both agreed that this is what you need to be doing and so we decided we're gonna pay for you to fly out here you can stay with us and the seeds of doubt begin to sow and there are all those dreams that I never really figured out what I was gonna do with I had made a definitive decision to abandon them had made a definitive decision to embrace them and the seeds of doubt started to come up and I'm like oh no I'm confused again I'm confused again it's like that that girl you date where it's like your mom says no don't date that girl but you're like I'm confused mom am I in love or am I stupid and so I remember you know asking you know my philosophy professors about it a few of them that was close to and and you know they gave me the answer that I probably would have given myself if I were to be talking to my 20 year old self it was basically like man look you're on a good path right now you got a lot of potential with philosophy you know what I mean like and this is a good thing you can have a big impact on people with this and you're doing good man you know just just focus you know and it's not like you're going to be 50 when you graduate if you've got other things that you want to do you still can but getting a PhD is pretty hard takes a lot of focus and it becomes harder to come back to and do that kind of stuff later on just focus you're in a good position you got a full ride focus and I remember so the the hall that the the name of the building was Dunbar where all the philosophy professors were and you know I walked down the long hall you know towards the stairs to go back home that day and there was a philosophy professor I believe she was the only female in the department I could be wrong on that her name is was Sylvia Culp that door was always closed she was I never met her before I knew that she was a philosophy professor never had any of her classes never even saw her in person but on this particular day that door was open and Sylvia Culp professor Culp was there sitting in her chair and I was like one more perspective let's get one more perspective and I don't think I was conscious of this at the time but as I look back on it I was hoping that someone would say something different to me in order in order to give me permission to what I was to do what I was looking for an excuse to do and so I knock on the door I introduce myself to Dr. Culp say you know I've never taken your class I'm a I'm in the grad department here but I'd love to get your perspective on something I'm wrestling with she's like yeah have a seat and we started to talk and she says to me she says you know there are a lot of philosophers out there but the last thing the world needs is one more philosopher that's going to be working with future generations and talking with them about the good life when that philosopher doesn't even know what it means to be honest with themselves about their own dreams the most interesting thinkers are the people that are willing to take risk they're the people that are willing to go get answers to their own existential questions you can't be a great thinker and a great educator just by reading books and studying what the other philosophers have thought that's not what Wittgenstein did that's not what anybody who's worth their salt did you've got to live life go get your answers if you want to come back to this when you're older there's no expiration date on being a philosopher either go get your answers and I knew that's what I needed to hear and I made the decision to break hearts hearts so check it out I had this buddy in the philosophy department this one cat we're really cool and I told him and I was like man I'm just gonna do it he's like you're crazy I was like I'm gonna do it and he says okay look he goes you're crazy you're out of your mind but if you're gonna do this you gotta practice and you gotta be ready he's like you're gonna blow everything you're about to blow your scholarship you're about to blow your social capital here basically he's like so you gotta be ready he's like this is what we're gonna do he was like we're gonna walk around campus and we're gonna stop all the people that we walk into randomly and we're gonna tell them that you're gonna audition for American Idol and you're gonna sing for them on the spot and he says that's gonna be scary he says but it's gonna work your nerves because when you get in front of those judges man you've got to have courage you've got to be ready right and and we did that over the course of a week we did that you know and by this time I had already told my friend I'm coming out there I'm gonna do it I'll accept your offer so they're excited I have my date for when I'm going out there for the audition and now I'm just going across campus with my buddy and we're stopping people and and one of the first people that I stopped there's a group of these three tall black dudes and I stopped them and I told them and they gave me the look like they looked me up and down they looked at each other and one of the guys said whatever man go and do your thing whatever and I sang for them and and and their faces lightened up their eyes widened they smiled and one of the guys said hey hey dog you got some skill man and he gave me some depth he was like hey do your thing bro do your thing right and uh and and I and I got that experience from so many people by the time I was close to getting on that plane to go to my audition I was so bold I remember walking into this coffee shop on campus called rocket star cafe a lot of the students would hang out I walked in and I stand on the table and I say attention everybody I am getting ready to go audition for American Idol and I'm just trying to work on my nerves so that by the time I get there I'm ready to shine I would love to sing for you by the time I finished it was like let's go let's go I sang for them everybody gave me this huge applause and I was like destiny it's like right out of a movie this is happening baby I'm about to go win American Idol this is happening I go out there I could talk with you for two hours about the experience of being out there what it was like what it's like to audition for that show I'm gonna fast forward to to the moment where I'm standing before producers so one thing I gotta make clear because some people are gonna be like well where's the video so here's what you gotta know about the audition I could tell you so much about it but when you audition for like the three celebrity judges you know that the auditions that you see on tv those are auditions that you actually gotta make it to okay because there are so many people who audition there are other producers that you audition for first okay and you don't make it to those judges unless you establish enough interestingness you know for the other producers that's right it's not just talent it's not just talent it's not just talent because you can be a good stinger but you know the entertainment industry is also about interestingness right you need personality you need something that is you know you need style and also if I've got 20 people that look similar you know who can all you know do runs or sing with silky smooth voices okay it's like I've already got voice to men what's what's different here you know what's unique and so you have to have that unique elements so and there's also two ways you can be interesting you can be interestingly good or you can be interestingly bad you can be a terrible singer but you can be worth watching right you can be worth watching and so you got to be sufficiently interesting to get moved on so my opportunity comes up and I sing and the way it is is they point you one way if you go to that next round and when you're sitting it was at the San Jose Shark Stadium and you're sitting in this crowd and it's like full man's thousands of people and you get called down in groups at a time so when you're watching from the crowd you see the producers do like this and then that person has a oh yeah made it to the next round where you see them do like this and that person hangs their head they're like they're sheep and the goats yeah I get up there man I do my best voice to man thing and they pointed me to the to the exit door I lost I lost man I was not the child of destiny I lost you are not looking at the next American Idol but I'll tell you let me tell you why that was one of the most important moments in my life first thing when I finished audition auditioning you better believe I was crushed for at least at least maybe a couple of weeks especially with all that I put on the line for I couldn't go back to the world that I knew but at the same time there was this sense of intoxication that came from that there are certain things you do in life that feel scary before you do them but then when you do them you're like I want more I want more of that adrenaline rush I want more of that challenge I want more of the right to look back on my life and say yeah I did that I already know that's gonna be one interesting story to tell in 20 years that's gonna be more interesting for people to hear than what my job title is I want more of that right I want to live for the interesting story to tell that's the first thing the second thing is even though I took action steps that might have made it look like I was bold to an outside observer I was scared on the inside I was frightened the whole time and I discovered that fear on the inside out is an entirely different experience than fear from the outside looking in when you're looking at creative risk on the outside it seems like your fears are just going to destroy you and embarrass you and drag you through the world making an open show of you but when you actually step into that fear you realize that that experience from the inside out it's just another challenge to face and and when you realize that it doesn't destroy you that it doesn't really embarrass you that nobody really cares that even when you are embarrassed you overcome it and you don't care it makes you ask yourself what else have I wanted to do that I've been afraid of now now that I've slaved that beast of fear do I have any other things I need to be honest with myself about because I'm ready baby I'm ready to get after that the other thing that it made me realize is that the pearl of great price is not a dream come true but it's the person that you get to become as a result of being true to those dreams the real reason to pursue a dream isn't because of some Disney narrative that when you wish upon a star it makes no difference who you are the reason you pursue your dreams isn't because the universe gives us a guarantee that we're going to get everything that we want the reason you pursue your dreams is because on the other side of fear there is a version of yourself that is superior to the person you are right now in every single way there's a version of you that's smarter than the person that you are now there's a version of you that has a better sense of humor that's more creative that's more self-confident and you don't get to be that person until you step through your fears because when you conceive a dream what you just have is a vision a vision that exists inside your head or inside your heart but in order to pursue a dream you have to take action steps that will lead to different ways of engaging reality you're going to meet people along the way you're going to make new observations you're going to learn things about yourself and about the world and so it's impossible to follow a dream while remaining the same person that you were when you initially conceived the dream the mere act of pursuing a dream leaves you transformed like it's it's an alchemical process you know and and that that changed everything man that changed me more than any self-help book that changed me more than any girl who dumped me that changed me more than any class that I took just by following that one dream and at that point it was like game on man game on like I failed at that what else do I want to do I'm good with that like I'm actually cool like what else do I want to do and from that point on if I wanted to do something I just went after it and I tried it some things I failed at some things I succeeded at and none of those things have I regretted because as that saying goes the likelihood that you'll regret the things you do far less than likelihood you'll regret the things that you don't given all of the prefacing fine print that we need to give about within the boundaries of what is legally morally blah blah blah you know so anyway man I could I could tell you about so many different things that I've done since then and and each of them can have a story just as long but I think that story especially to the audience of younger people that might be wrestling with what they want to do one of the things I'll say to that is don't treat your purpose in life as an intellectual puzzle to be resolved by navel gazing or meditating or analyzing or asking a bunch of people questions that's only one part of seeking after the truth but there are things that you can only know by engaging reality and a lot of people when they think about finding the will of God they use the will of God as a way of hiding they they treat the will of God as if once I find out what God wants me to do then I'll do something that gives me guarantees I'll do something and I can know for sure that I won't fail because God you know has told me this is what he wants me to do with my life but that's not even remotely consistent with what we see in the scriptures think about Moses who had the very experience that everyone would dream of he had this burning bush experience right where God is like this is what I want you to do who doesn't want that right and then Moses walks up to Pharaoh you know like hey God told me exactly what to say to this man in fact I even had an objection to God when he told me what to do and God was like no problem Moses if he asks you that you tell him this so I'm ready right I go up to Pharaoh Pharaoh let my people go thus says the Lord right and Pharaoh says no right and and the best part is the Bible says it was God who did that right it was God who did that Pharaoh says no man I'm not letting your people go Moses welcome to a story of all sorts of unpredictable things that you didn't realize that was going to happen welcome to a story where you're going to feel frustrated multiple times welcome to a story where you're going to feel like you're failing you're still going to have questions you're still going to have doubts you're still going to wonder what the heck is God doing in my life because having a purpose does not mean having a detailed roadmap of what's going to happen every step along the way having a purpose means having a relationship with God and understanding that your trust is not in your knowledge of what's going to come next but it's in the knowledge of the context within which your life takes place this is the meaning of Proverbs when it says trust in the Lord with all of your heart and lean not on your own understanding but in all of your ways acknowledge him he will direct your paths and something that I would encourage young people to do if you're wrestling with like finding your calling whatever it may be is don't be afraid to try new things don't be afraid to experiment don't be afraid you know knowledge of what you don't want is just as valuable as knowledge as you know of what you do want you know yeah go get a job at McDonald's but that's not what I want to do for the rest of my life so what you learn a lot about customer service you learn a lot about work ethic you learn a lot about things that are going to be applicable to whatever your dream is I mean I have so many people that tell me things like I want to be a business owner I don't want to be a burger flipper and I tell them well if you're going to own a business then you're going to need to be able to motivate people to actually respect you enough to work for you and I know for me I don't want to work for any business owner that has no concept of what it's like to pick up a broom and sweep the floor I don't want to work for any business owner that has no concept of what it's like to relate to me and my ability to take out the garbage you know what I mean everything that you do will help you build character and you never have to worry about getting stuck in a job if you're worried about getting stuck in a job I'll say this to you the way to get stuck isn't by doing something that you don't want to do for the rest of your life the way to get stuck is to stop growing within that position you can do anything and you'll eventually outgrow it if you pursue it with excellence people make this mistake of thinking that well if I go all in with my job at target if I if I show up to my job at Starbucks and give it the same effort I would give to my dream then that means I'm going to be stuck in that job forever and it's no it's the opposite it's the person who resents their job and drags their feet and shows up like oh I hate being here that's going to be stuck there for the rest of their life the person who shows up with enthusiasm and performs with excellence is the person that's going to be getting job offers for every month it's the person that the manager is going to be afraid of losing because that manager knows I got such a great employee every every you know car salesman is going to be like trying to recruit this kid to go sell you know Lamborghini's you know that's how it works when you do what you do with pride and excellence anyway I'm gonna pause here oh I I can listen to you all day long I really can wow wow wow you have a gift I am I am I am mightily you you have a gift you have a gift wow I talked a lot of people you have a gift I and and what you just what you laid down right there that was you have a gift what God will do with that gift that's a whole nother thing but you have a gift and I praise God for you and I praise God for your voice and I am so glad I don't even remember who on Twitter said oh you talked to TK Coleman who's that I don't know I talked to this guy no problem I I am blessed I am deeply deeply blessed well I appreciate you being gracious enough to to reach out and be willing to connect um you know you know I'll take a I'll take a quick moment to just kind of um just say you know because I didn't talk about what I do in the present and I know I'm skipping a lot of steps but that's okay you know because now I really want to know what you're doing in the present because it's like wow I'm primed I'm I'm all ears yeah well so for the past six years I've worked as the education director for an apprenticeship program I co-founded called Praxis and if you're looking it up it's discoverpraxis.com and the goal there was to criticize by creating one of the things that my co-founder and I realize is that there are a lot of people who aren't interested in going to college but they still need to know how to develop skills in order to be able to create wealth in the marketplace and have a career and if you if you aren't the right fit for college or if you don't want to go that route all you really have is is military and and trade school and a few other small you know niche markets and so we wanted to to sort of reinvigorate the concept of an apprenticeship but but for the white-collar world there are all sorts of things like sales marketing customer success and so forth you know that that apprenticeships can be a viable model for and in the startup world they're a lot more open to the idea of not requiring a traditional credential they're they're open to the idea of alternative signals and ultimately what they want to see is just evidence that you know how to create value they're not really concerned about a degree either way and so we started this apprenticeship program where you know we run our students through a professional boot camp they learn about different aspects of not only job and career prep but different aspects of value creation and through that we have helped launch you know over 200 careers over the past several years and i've been the education director you know focused on things like coaching the participants you know things like helping develop the curriculum and so forth and where i'm situated now my primary focus is i'm the director of entrepreneurial education for an organization called fee fee stands for the foundation for economic education it's a non-profit it's the oldest free market think tank in the country and fee is devoted to popularizing things like the economic way of thinking financial literacy and entrepreneurial habits in college age and high school students so a lot of what i've been doing with fee i've been an adjunct faculty member with fee for about the past five years and i've been teaching a lot of these things but now my focus is centered around really helping people understand the distinction between being an entrepreneur and being entrepreneurial being an entrepreneur it's you know starting a business founding a startup being entrepreneurial is about a way of thinking it's about bringing a sense of artistry and creativity to whatever it is you do and i want to help teach people how to not only apply that to their careers and to their dreams but to their relationships to to their personal challenges in life because it really does apply to everything when you bring these insights to the table and so i'm focused on that but i also have a special place in my heart to help with the building of black communities particularly young black men i believe as you have probably seen in your experience in black communities the entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well in our young black boys it is alive and well and there are so many aspects of the behavior of young black boys that have been you know demonized or vilified mostly by maybe teachers that don't relate culturally and so they they translate their difficulty with handling our boys into a projection of like a lack of character in our boys and hey our boys are just like anybody else you know anybody can commit sin anybody can be difficult to deal with there's definitely that element but but and often the most difficult people to deal with are the ones with the most potential i've seen that all the time absolutely absolutely and so there are a lot of issues in black communities that i think are very important to address and i think it's absolutely you know absolutely important that you know black entrepreneurs like myself black educators black economists make an investment in those communities i'm not interested in somebody passing a law to force us to do this but but it's in my heart to do it and i want to popularize that you know um you take for instance i'll just give you one example and and maybe this pushes us in the direction of some of those you know mcwarder lorry discussions doesn't have to this goes anywhere it goes sure sure thing you know you take the topic of mental health and you take you take kind of the difference between what black kids experience and what white kids experience when you look at the school shootings for instance you know usually done by you know young suburban white males whenever these school shootings happen these are without a doubt tragic events and everybody agrees that it's a tragedy but they're almost always correlated with a national discussion on mental health because there's an understanding or rather there's a confusion over how these perfectly good suburban kids who grew up in affluent homes managed to do something so tragic and because it's such a rare dramatic thing there there's a collective sense of how do we fail our our young boys how did we fail them what did we do wrong why didn't we see this coming surely there must have been some sign of existential angst in the hearts of these young boys what can we do better to make sure this doesn't happen again but you also have a problem of violence in black communities and you know when when black people kill other black people it's sort of like maybe without explicitly saying it kind of a sense of well that's what thugs do right we'll see that's why y'all get locked up all the time we'll see that's why the police are in your neighborhoods all the time see y'all just don't know how to act and we don't really have that same investment in conversations about mental health in black communities in addition to that we have our own set of stigmas that we bring to the table we're even admitting that there's a problem with mental health even suggesting that getting therapy you know for a problem that you have is a little bit taboo we're kind of new at this in black communities and we're just learning how to warm up to it and we don't have a you know a long history of black scholars devoting themselves to this to studies in this coming back to the communities teaching it we're relatively new you know and so being a part of a movement that involves facilitating those conversations supporting people that are doing the work you know encouraging other people to do the work you know being a sales pitch for for people with talent to meet these needs being a sales pitchman for people with talent to meet these needs that's that's something that really occupies a very large place in my heart and it's it's one of the reasons why even though the topic of race relations in america has never been at the forefront of my conversation it's never been what i've led with it's one of the reasons why i've taken more interest in being a part of these discussions because i think some of the most important points that are necessary for people to understand if we're going to create change are being missed because a lot of a lot of what's talked about now is being reduced to left versus right talking points and when your moral reasoning is limited to left versus right and you're not thinking about it in terms of good versus evil right versus wrong true versus false then there's a whole spectrum of things that you're not just that you're just not going to see and so that's what's that's one of the things that's important to me yeah wow wow i i i just i praise god for you and the work that you're doing and i don't i don't know anything about it except what you've told me and i'm old enough to know that folks can talk well but um i i what what you are what you are telling me is is just so good to hear because yeah i mean my whole life i've i've lived and worked in communities that have been struggling with with so much of this and um i i so deeply appreciate appreciate you know i just i just deeply appreciate what how you laid this out because obviously laying it out isn't sufficient every preacher knows that laying it out is not sufficient to seeing it happen we know that but laying it out is a helpful first step to at least get an idea of what we want to look for and um i mean right away i i said well i got i got two daughters that are i'm gonna i'm gonna put i'm gonna send them to your website because they graduated college but it's like yeah you girls got some you girls got some uh got some education in the university but you don't have much education in the world and so um but i and i'm oh wow you know we had a couple of girls started coming to the church um one was 12 and the other was 13 and the 12 year old girl was white and um she could only come if she'd bring her friend who was a 13 year old girl and she was black and they started coming to church when they were kids and my church has mostly older folks and so not hardly any kids around they started coming to church and started coming by themselves and you know the church was just all grandparenting them like crazy because so happy to see them here and the uh the 13 year old girl she was being raised by her grandmother um her father was her father and her uncle were both living in the house and there were reasons why neither the father nor the mother had had custody and again these are and and and you know and and this this this girl so she started coming to church and then for after a while the 12 year old her friend just kind of dropped out but the 13 year old kept coming and she kept coming all the way through and like her her mother her grandmother came once and was horrified because i mentioned harry potter in a sermon and that oh you know and so then she couldn't come for a few weeks but she got to come back to church and and you know and and then so anyway and um so then her so then she was she was she graduated high school got good grades smart diligent i mean this girl so much potential this young woman had and and we had someone in our church who who was fairly well off and was having scholarships for people so i i told her i said look you can go you can go to so many schools you can go to you know you can get we we i i would love to help you get into a four-year school and really you know because her grand the situation at home wasn't great and then she's like no my grandmother won't sign the fafsa because my grandmother says why is someone going to give you money and it's like because she would have gotten all the financial aid she needed yeah and then her grandmother dies and she's 18 so it's like okay let's do this and she doesn't and and i can't tell you how many stories like this i have where someone grows up and they're in a difficult circumstance but they've made at least one or two right connections where it's like let me help you get on a track and there's money out there there's scholarships out there there's schools out there you know for a student like you there is a way right now let me help you get in that way and so often they you know maybe they got to community college but they didn't have a mentor and you know and they didn't have this you know and and i just i just years and years and years of of watching this and you know and and what's amazing to me is that you know at the same hand there's some members families of the church who they're african-american families and they're they've sent their kids to the best schools and they've got all these scholarships lined up and it's just boom boom and they're just out in the world and their dramatic successes and and and so it's like you know and so i say to the kids from you know from a very difficult situation single parent household what have you and you know i i you know did you see what happened with that person you know let me help you let me have help you have a track that looks more like that and the track that looks more like some of these other tracks and so i'm i'm inspired by your vision and i i love i love what you said about i mean because i i've grown so again i grew up in paterson and then i worked in the dominican republic and i'll tell you in the caribbean these these so i worked with haitians in the dominican republic and they were illegal and the saying was you know a dominican will only it's kind of like the americans and the mexicans you know a dominican will only work when there's no food on the table the haitian will work even when there you know there is food on the table because the haitians have this reputation of being entrepreneurs you know if they could just get to the dominican republican and of course there's selection process it's these these haitians that are willing to cross the border and make a life the border and make a life and but you know i i saw all of this dynamism and then of course from the new york area so dominicans were coming to new york and you know they were entrepreneurial they were pushing and boy they demanded their kids got an education and they you know you i mean these people were on the move and it was like they're yes i know there are obstacles in this world but there are opportunities and so i am i am again you have you have simply inspired me today and i you have you have you have really encouraged me and i am so deeply deeply grateful for for for your story and and and just you know yeah if your parents are listening good job good and faithful servants because you know i well you all know our parents aren't perfect and when you have young adult children you know you you get to see all the ways that you failed them because they'll tell you um but you know i i need this i want you to go ahead and tell my parents how good of a job they did with me i need this well i know they know the bad side too don't get me wrong um they're preachers kid you know how to you know how to you know how to talk i hear i heard that right away but you know and and one of the things so i got into this i mean i was just a anonymous small church pastor in a little dying church and you know just what what you said is true i you know i got i got to the point at this age it's like what do i got left to lose now you know and my career's not going anywhere you know and so why don't i go on the internet and make a film make a video about jordan peterson and and then why don't i talk to randos and then why don't i start meetups and all of that's been wonderful for the last few years and it tracks with exactly what you said about the world and actually it tracks with exactly what jordan parent jordan peterson was telling young people he was saying look you know you sit there in your mother's basement covered with cheetos dust playing video games all day um you know yeah you're going to be miserable and and i began to discover all of these people who were simply depressed and you know having this meaning crisis and you know he would he would peterson's a whole other topic but no you're um people who listen to my channel are going to deeply appreciate what you have to say and i'll warn you they're going to um they're they're going to follow you on twitter and they'll probably be sending you emails and they'll be putting things in the comment and uh but that is that is all good so you you have you have inspired me well let me let me ask you this how's it going yeah i mean it's going well you know the the the harvest is always right and the labors are always few so if you are involved in in the work of building broken people building broken communities you're you're you're never at a at a shortage of work to do you know um every opportunity is a problem every problem is an opportunity and there's a lot of work to do and there are a lot of people out there that are willing to collaborate there are a lot of people out there that are eager to be mentored eager to be taught eager to have someone you know show them love eager to have someone tell them the truth about themselves in a way that heals if i can if i can just make a quick aside about that a lot of times when we talk about people who tell it like it is or people who kill it like keep it real imagine a person in your mind who who represents that for you and i can almost guarantee that it's someone who's willing to tell you things about yourself that hurt even though you don't want to hear them but they're true right we almost never use that for people that tell us how beautiful we are for people that tell us how much potential that we have and i believe that facts don't care about your feelings but that applies to the positive and the negative so facts don't care about your feelings and if the fact is you're beautiful i don't care if it makes you feel good i'm gonna tell you the truth i'm gonna keep it real you know if it builds your self-esteem and makes you feel more comfortable in your own body i don't care that it's fluffy i don't care that it makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside if it's true i'm gonna tell it to you and so we got a lot of people that enjoy keeping it real as long as they get to be the person to to slam dunk the truth on top of your head when it makes you feel bad we need more people that are willing to to throw that pitch right down the middle to you you know so that you can hit the home run that you're going to hit there are a lot of truths that people need to be told about themselves that are very healing not just truths that need to be hurt and i enjoy i enjoy telling people the truth about themselves that needs to be healing i mean that has the power to be healing and so i don't enjoy the fact i don't take delight in the fact that the suffering in this world is the basis for that opportunity i don't take delight in that at all but but what i do stems from not not a place of guilt it doesn't stem from a place of duty it's not something i think i need to do in order to avoid going to hell it's not something i think i need to do in order to convince anybody that i'm a good guy it's something that genuinely makes me come alive one of my favorite quotes comes from the minister and civil rights activist howard thurman who said ask not yourself what the world needs but rather what makes you come alive for that is what the world needs people who have come alive and for me this is the work that makes me come alive there are million and one problems to solve no matter which set of problems you devote yourself to you are guaranteed to leave more problems unsolved when you die than solved so if you try to start with like guilt and duty you're never going to have rest because it's like okay i'm dedicating myself to the problem of cancer but what about domestic violence over here okay i'm dedicating myself to the problem of domestic violence but what about poverty and minority communities oh okay yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna dedicate myself to that i want them to know i'm a good guy yeah but what about misinformation and mainstream media okay and you're just going to be running around with no peace trying to virtual signal in every direction what is the set of problems that it makes you come alive to solve and if you haven't gotten that far that's okay what observations in the world in the real world stoke your curiosity right start there and when you deal with the stuff that makes you come alive then you'll begin to realize that is your inner compass pointing you in the direction of your gift that's the thing that makes room for you in this world and that's the thing that even though you have suffering even though you have difficulty you have something special that makes it meaningful and that's what meaning is meaning isn't about having it easy meaning isn't about always loving what you do because you ask any parent there's a huge difference between i love x and i'm happy with x right now right when you wake up to you know a crying baby at two in the morning i don't know if that's passion right i don't know if that's following your highest excitement you know that's that's meaning right that's that's love it's a kind of love that's anchored in something that's deeper it's kind of like in lord of the rings you know where where everybody who takes that ring it corrupts them because it's a powerful force that can destroy you but if you're called to be the ring bearer you have something special that other people don't have and you can be able to carry the burden not because you're trying to virtue signal by carrying the burden but because you know this is what my heart beckons me to do when you find that work it gives you the strength to endure the suffering other people on the outside looking in will say wow you're so courageous wow you have so much endurance and you'll just be like nope i'm just following my calling you know and we can all have that when we follow our calling so things are going well man i'm just i'm just continuing to do the work and uh continue to do what i'm called to do you know one step at a time one good deed at a time that's all wow wow well i'm satisfied i mean we got more time if you want to use it but i don't want to take any more of your time than than is necessary but i i don't maybe you i don't know if you have any questions for me but um go ahead and give i mean send me you know message me the links and things that i should include here where people can find you and how they can support your work and how you know because you know to whatever degree my channel um can give you some visibility and spread the news about what you're doing and so that people can support you i want to be able to do that sure i appreciate that i do got you have one question for you let's go back to our brothers we have in common uh john and glenn have you had a chance to have them on your show have you talked no no no i you know i the the thing that people do is they always try and get like a bigger name on their channel and i don't like that i don't like that you know i've had some i've had some people and if jordan peterson says paul i want to be on your channel i'll have them on my channel that's all right but the thing is you know one of the things so one of the things i learned from watching my father serve the people he served is that um you know the the riches the riches that god has placed in this world in corners no one will ever see and and so that's why i like it doesn't do anything for my youtube algorithm to have randos on my channel i have conversations with people that will never have a youtube channel and and nobody will you know nobody outside their own little immediate circle will ever know their story but i you know in in c.s lewis's the great divorce where you know there's this there's this basically there's this parade in the middle of heaven for this woman and c.s lewis's you know they're the main characters like who's that and it's this name that nobody knows and you know this world is full of saints that will never be recognized in this world and so you know i i praise god for what glenn laury and john mcward are doing and if they wanted to be on my show they they're always welcome and if they wanted me to be on their show i don't i don't know that i have a lot to contribute to what they're doing because they're doing it far better than i ever could and it's all that calling business you know we're all we're all called and and again you you said it so perfectly when and i tell my kids that all the time i say look you have no idea when you you know for a while you know we didn't have a janitor at church so my son was you know cleaning up the church and i said you know you're doing a good job here and that's you know obviously i'm your father and so you know i can hold you accountable but sometimes parents don't hold their kids accountable but you know i just let them know that i was really proud of them because i'll tell you whatever we call that there's various names for it but whatever we call that that little thing i mean wherever you go that thing will be valued and that's far more important than the degree you have or the number of people who see you because the truth is if you're a boss and you have a really good worker you don't want to talk too much about them because you know someone else might take them but the world you know we we we finally serve before an audience of one and what what each of us yeah it's fun to have acclamation and fame but you also know that there's another side that comes with it in this world which is criticism and critique and and the more painful criticisms and critiques are the ones that are true but you know we we finally serve before an audience of one and so i want if if my channel lets you know a few extra people know about these saints who will not you know will not be known far beyond their own immediate circles i'm really happy with that because i and the pleasure i get is is i get a chance to know them and see them and and my life has been i mean it started in a weird way so i started making these videos about jordan peterson and then i'm a pastor so people are like can i talk to you and it's like i'm a pastor i should say yes so then i talk to them and then and then you know we'd have conversations on zoom like you and i are having now and the conversations would get repetitive i thought other people could stand to listen to this so can i record this they'd say in some of a lot of them about half of them aren't you know appropriate to record or share because there's too much personal stuff but a bunch of them were and so then i thought well what if i posted on my channel you know would the world end if i do that and i get their permission and then people start watching this and and and pretty soon everybody got the sense that you know i'm not alone i've i've got my i've got my failures i've got my fears i've got my limitations but you know i'm not alone and people began finding each other and connecting with each other and and to me that's just the job of i said this is what pastors do this you know we bring people together and you know if if the church is all about the pastor well it's not really a church it's just a you know sermon listening society it's they're each other and they get knitted together in the body of christ and they're all unique individuals and so in a weird way over the last couple of years that's what's happened and i'm not surprised because i say well this is this is what christ does he knits his body together i didn't plan on it and so i somebody says talk to this guy okay and look at look at how i've been blessed today so i just i just keep doing this and i'm happy with that yeah man that's awesome and i love that perspective about the uh what's the what's the hidden treasures in the corner quote again well it's it's you know it's the pearl of great price but it's also i don't it was that that was from c.s lewis and the and the um the great divorce where there's and he even gives this woman is sally smith of some little community somewhere you know and i just did so again i've i've lived a weird life so one of the one of my good friends when i first moved to one of my good friends when i first moved to sacramento a guy down the street was driving by he saw my son he's about the same age as his youngest son says hey your son want to play soccer i thought i'm not gonna ask him i'll say yes yeah he'll play soccer he doesn't know nothing he's six years old what does he know he didn't even know what soccer is so yeah he'll play soccer and so then you know i i you know this the guy right down the street we became friends and he had you know grown up in the black church and then finally we're getting to know each other so what do you do for a living i said i'm a i'm a pastor he says oh i know pastors pastors are kingdom builders they build their own kingdoms and um he's like oh and he's in politics this guy um he's a he's a lot of people in sacramento in politics and so you know but he and i became friends and he started coming to the church and they started bringing his friends to the church and in many ways the church is alive because of him but um and so then when his um his mother died a few years ago this is so read the warrant of other sons because i was reading the book at the time he asked me to do the funeral for his mother down in la so i went down to la to do the funeral for his mother but you know and and so i looked at i looked at his life and here's here's someone who grew up in a bad neighborhood and in la and you know how many of the people around him didn't go anywhere didn't get anywhere and here's someone who you know eventually you know went to you know graduated from public high school went to occidental got a law degree i mean he'll he's far more successful than i am and in so many ways um but then you know when his mother died he was going to make sure and so i was i felt a little embarrassed i felt a little embarrassed giving the the eulogy for his mother at the funeral because of course they're all the politicians and you know you go to a big black funeral in la and you know here's this then people are like why is this white guy doing the eulogy for his mother but you know but here's the thing why did he he made he made his mother had a good going off party because he knew he knew what she sacrificed for him to become the man he was and that that goes on to his children and grand i mean i mean she her sacrifice and and you know again i grew up i grew up watching these women in the church sacrifice and and do for their sons and their daughters and and many of them got sidelined into things and you know were incarcerated or or died early or you know there's heroin and aids and all that where i was growing up in paterson but so when you look at my friend who he's a visible man and people will talk about his successes and you know all of that but it was his mother and he knows it so we did in his funeral it's like you know and i knew exactly you know because sing her praises because nobody might know her name yeah but she made it happen and it's and i'm convinced what jesus says you know the kingdom you know be of good cheer little flock for it's your father's good pleasure to give you his kingdom but you know she might have gone out of this world with you know pretty nice funeral but you know was she ever wealthy was you know and she was she was just she was just one sister who went to church faithfully and you know fought like crazy to make sure that that her boy did not lot wind up like i mean how i mean you know as well as i knew how many stories are there like that and well you and i might know them but the world doesn't see them and we see you know we see the you know we see the obamas and say wow but i know that before the obamas there were mothers and fathers and communities that that sacrificed and poured into them and and in my mind those are the heroes and their stories are not often told and so to the degree that i can not only help tell some of those stories and encourage others to be those individuals who maybe maybe no one will ever know your name and maybe you'll never be on a stage and maybe maybe you'll never have the gift of gab like a preacher but i know that when we stand before the throne and god looks at their sacrifices because again it's always the sacrifice when god looks at their sacrifices and when we get to the other side we will see that and so yeah you know we'll we'll get to talk to some of the big names on the other side but the ones who will i'm convinced the ones who will be the ones who will be heralded are many people that we've never even heard of so yeah and the bible's full of that and and it makes you wonder if how much we'll really care about the big names i mean think about when you were in fifth grade or think about when you were in high school wasn't there someone there that was just so cool so popular and maybe to get that person to like you would confer so much credibility on you and then by the time you're done down you know done with college you don't even remember that person's name they have nothing to do with anything that you're trying to achieve in life right then by the time you grow older and you get married it's like you only keep in touch with about two or three of them you know it's just a totally different game yeah you know as you grow wiser but you know you make me think about there's this movie i think it's oh my gosh the name of it is something like mr magickorium wonder emporium it's some weird name like that i know i butchered it but it's i think it's uh johnny depp is in there i think uh heath ledger before he passed away um but there there's a there's a moment in there where you see like someone someone finds this there's like a group of monks and they they just all they do is they do this like chant over and over and over again and uh and the guy you know is asking like well what's this all about and and and the monk tells him well this is the chant that sustains the universe and you know like if if they stopped chanting the entire universe would dissipate but but the whole world was being held together by these guys that were just praying in some far corner of the earth that no one knew about and and while while everyone's getting angry about who's going to win the super bowl or some terrible call that a referee made at a basketball game it's like the work of these monks in a corner that no one will ever know about who are keeping this whole universe together so we can even have a super bowl to go to you know um but i i like your work that you're doing in this regard because i i feel like today more than ever there there's a kind of distorted relationship we have with fame and the role that it plays in the pursuit of a fulfilling life you know because when you look at the pre-internet world the pre-printing press world the pre-automobile world the pre-industrial world which is still the overwhelming majority of human history people's concept of being known was a local thing you you were known in your family you were known in your neighborhood you were maybe known in the marketplace but this idea that i live in nebraska and my life doesn't count as much if i'm not known in chicago that's a very recent phenomenon that did not play a role at all in ancient people's medieval peoples like modern people's concept of happiness and and we're one of the first generations that have this ability to be discontent because we are we have this heightened awareness of people that grew up next to us but who are known in new york and in california you know or there's someone that lives in ireland that's known all across the united states and we can compare ourselves to them and and so we have this idea that in order for my work to count in order for me to have an impact i need to have fame and and i don't think most of the bible verses were written with with fame in mind with our contemporary idea of fame in mind it was written from a perspective that's large enough to provide us with guidance for such a world but it certainly wasn't written in a way that prioritized this contemporary concept of fame and i think your mission is kind of bringing us back to this this ancient wisdom that says it's its impact not not likes not vanity metrics that's okay to have it but don't don't keep yourself from using your voice or doing what you do just because you don't get to have a blue check mark by your name you know well and and you know your story the worst thing that could have happened to you was probably to go on to the next level because you know i the your that i wouldn't when i when i message you after this i'll let you know some of the very interesting ways that there's been some um that there's been some interesting intersections between you and i that i'm not going to say right now on the tape but it's it's not and and again i i mean i so i work in a space now of of a lot of apologetics but it's kind of my own way of apologetics it's not really like that other way but you know people people wonder why i still believe in god and why i believe in providence but i i listen to a story like yours and i say there's somebody's fingerprints all over this story and and he thought yeah i'm gonna send this is this guy's gonna this guy's gonna trash his philosophy program he's gonna go out west and he's gonna sing to all these people he's gonna get out there and he's gonna lose but i am going to the things that i am going to do with that moment and with this man's life i'm gonna do i'm gonna do my work with this man and again as a as a christian there's no there's no there's no greater honor than we can have than to be used by god and um you know and the you know the story of mary is you know talk about talk about messing up somebody's life you know in that culture in that context show up pregnant when you're already betrothed to a you know probably an older man who's going to make your future secure and you show up pregnant and the best line you have is god did it i mean let me talk about parents coming down on you um ain't nobody gonna believe that so you know and that's to me just just god god is the great storyteller and we are his stories and he he loves making good ones and i think the word that you had about about you know gosh i get in trouble saying that because sometimes i watch the risk people's like through the risks people take and it's like that's just dumb now now moving out to la yeah i can understand your parents but that's also you know you're doing it in the time of life if you if you had been 45 years old with three kids and a wife and a morgan's and say i'm gonna quit my job and we're all gonna go to hollywood and i'm gonna be a star i i'd lean even heavier on you but um but no god this is this is the work of god and so it's all good it's good you got time for one more question oh absolutely i i like us i i go full joe rogan on this channel i mean we take our time all right i got one more for you okay i i'm curious to hear from pastors on this i did a live stream today with my brother who's uh he's the campus pastor at roberts westland but he's also been a pastor of other churches before one of the things we're talking about is pastoring multicultural churches especially at a time like this right where where race is the hot topic and you know one of the things that that he has heard and i've heard other people talking about it you know there are some people that they want to hear what the gospel says about these current times and then there are others that say look man just preach jesus just preach love don't bring politics into it you know um how how do you navigate i'm curious to know how your congregation is responding to these times one of the challenges of a pastor is that you you don't get to be like if you were like a finance guru you could just sort of like stick to your thing you know you you could be like i won't even go there i'm not even gonna take that risk i'm not even gonna offend anybody i you know i'm just gonna stick to my thing but when you're a pastor and you have a community of people that are reacting to what's going on in the world it's like you you gotta speak to it you gotta address it and you know when you've got a lot of people in your congregation i can imagine people can be pulled different ways why why not right like they're arguing everywhere else how do you navigate the complexity of being able to speak from the heart of christ to your church what what challenges are you facing in the way people are responding to you or to the times and how are you dealing with it i'm just really curious about that well i i have it easy in many respects because my congregation is for the most part older as are many congregations and because the congregation is diverse and because i have in the christian reform church we have elders and deacons they're the office bearers and so i talk to my office bearers and i say hey this is going on you know what do you think we should do and i listened to them and i was i was teasing one of my elders the other day because he was saying now sacramento is a very so i i grew up in patterson which was very ghettoized and you know black folks lived here italians lived here jews lived there you know so that that was the new york area growing up i moved to grand rapids i lived in grand rapids for a while and in some ways race relations in grand rapids were even worse than patterson then i moved out to sacramento california and part of what you know in 2003 time magazine did a piece on my neighborhood and said this is the most integrated city in america and he said the diversity is just crazy broad and nobody's a majority and and that has helped sacramento and it doesn't mean that sacramento hasn't had its issues when stephan clark was was killed by the police that wasn't too far from here but i there are in my congregation so again if you read the warmth of other sons there's the california aspect to that there's the chicago aspect there's the east coast aspect and there's california aspect and i thought that that books that book laid it out perfectly but many of the um you know many of the older many of the the older people in my congregation grew up in louisiana and texas and florida during jim crowe and you know i listened to a lot of people today talking about their oppression and i i listened to them and i look at these people and whose whose stories i've heard and i actually talked to you know a couple of the the folks here at church and said i'm going to use my channel once this covet thing is done and i can sit down with these elders a little bit more safely i want to get their stories out on my channel because for years they've told me their stories about you know growing up in louisiana during jim crowe or in texas and and and these this generation is passing away but you know this that that generation you know fought the good fight in the south in um it and and i'm convinced they could not have done that if not for the church the church prepared a generation to sacrifice because that's what every every good thing happens in this world through sacrifice and that gen and that and and so you know and they were led by a man who said you know we're going to do marches and they can take almost everything away from me but they can't make me hate them and you know the power of that message just shocked people because we're all expecting this kind of thing and and so and yeah folks folks had to deal with the natural responses to to police dogs and water hoses and you know the the the imprisonment everything that went on in that story but it was it was it was the gospel and the church that taught these people for generations that number one they would suffer but number two they would not suffer in vain and and even if you know look at dr king's last sermon you know i've been to the mountaintop i might not get there with you well that mountaintop was how many legal successes that that movement achieved but obviously and if you're a christian you understand we don't get to the mountaintop here and that doesn't mean getting again all of this stuff is built into the christian story that all right i'm so i'm a calvinist so i had an interview with somebody and he was like this repud he was like this conservative and he was trying to make a point and he said like like are you a racist and i said yes he's like what do you mean i'm a calvinist that means that that the sin that i have even if i struggle with it i will never be fully free from it but i'm saved by grace which means that i'm not saved by virtue of achieving the the gift that has been given to me gives me the strength to to wrestle against my sin even though i keep losing because i work out of gratitude not out of an attempt to somehow secure something for myself that's the basic gospel message that we work out of gratitude so you know some people might look and say say paul how could you how could you still have racism in your heart when you were raised in the church you were raised and by the parents that you were raised and by the work that you've done overseas and in here in an america and i see that you've been you know i i got a i got a white homeless person and a black homeless person that i deal with every day because they they seem to think that outside my door is the best place in sacramento to camp and so it's like all kinds of trouble for me but but but no there's still racism in my heart there's still sexism in my heart there's still but that's just the beginning of the stuff that's in there and you might say well well if if that's true and you'll never be rid of it well first of all god loves me and and and so he's done this for me so i can be motivated to not grow weary in dealing with my own sin and those sins are not only in me they're in my church they're in our society we will we will never get to the mountaintop in this age but by the grace of god and with his strength may we never get weary of climbing that mountain either and it's both and so on my sermons are straight out of the heideberg catechism it's misery deliverance gratitude and all of the good things we do in life we do motivated by gratitude not out of fear sometimes there's fear there yeah but i ideally it's motivated by gratitude because i see what you know it's like again it's like my friend's funeral for his mother nobody said well you better give a good send-off for your mama no he did that send-off for her because he knew what she had suffered for him and you know he was going to make sure that everybody knew who the real hero of his story was and where did he learn that story he learned that from his mother and where did she learn that story she learned that story in church and you know what and the part of the problem is that the zeitgeist controlled by the media has a has a you know it has a attention span of two weeks and you know as well as i do that right now everybody's on tv saying oh because of george floyd things are going to be different now and i just sit back and think i believe that when i see it because i've watched this movie a and the truth is that the real change happens in the neighborhood because again of people like you and people like my friend's mother and people like my friend and people like the elders and the deacons and the elderly saints in this church that have an understanding of walking and keep walking even when you're weary because of what my lord has done for me and the promise he has in store for me so i will not labor in vain even if in my little lifetime i never see the fruits of my labor and this this you know and this is not just applicable to you know america's sinful painful history of race it's applicable to all of our sinful painful stuff and so you know churches churches have to speak to the moment but you know i often tell people politics is now religion as always that's the relationship between them and it's not that they're disconnected but you know as well as i do something's going to happen somewhere and the whole national tension is going to be off this and then something like this is going to happen again and people are going to be like i thought we took care of that and it's like yep that's so true yeah what kind of world do you think you're living in and and if you need to be and and it's only the it's not only the people but it's often the people who don't have an understanding of what makes me think sin is going to be so easy to root out out there when i struggle to root it out in here and if i know this about myself of course it's going to be hard out there but at the same time everything that you said is absolutely true so what do we do we still risk we still try we still go because christianity and the gospel is is the most optimistic story you can find because the end is already secured and so this the story of of this chapter of the world has a happy ending so you know but that's true of you know that's true of every we we never go to what we never go watch a movie of oh here this person was born to a wonderful family and everything went great and and they went everything they ever asked for happened for them and then they died nobody goes to that movie yep in fact the movie doesn't even begin until you get that conflict that's right you know you're you're you're bored i mean when when everybody's smiling and happy and hanging out having a good time it's like okay when's the action is going to start and it's not until like the camera zooms out and you see oh somebody's watching them or you know like the music gets all you know twisted and you're like oh there's something bad getting ready to happen that they don't know about now now we have ourselves a story yeah yeah yeah and so i i you know i on one hand again one of the things i appreciate about laurian mcwarter is that you know in many ways the the fight that dr king's movement fought bore good fruit and we can celebrate that absolutely you know again churches rehearse this all the time someone comes on some you know we're celebrating a milestone maybe somebody got sober maybe someone finally married that girlfriend they were living with for too long um you know we all celebrate we all celebrate that but we also know we celebrate the moment but we don't rest until they put us in the ground and there's always a new struggle so just like you said a few minutes ago so you know we keep doing what we're doing i i actually feel worse for you know a lot of the churches that don't have much diversity in them and that's most churches um because they well where are you going to turn for this and that's what makes me so frustrated by some of the voices i hear out there i don't know that they're being helpful and of course i've got my own opinions about what's helpful and i'm certainly not always right but so when i when i hear somebody and i think they're being honest they're being honest on the good side and the bad side and so let's let's stick with that and like you know this moment will pass but um let's let's keep doing the work that we're called to do every day yeah right on the money that's it the the spotlight will forget about this and move on to something else the trends will change but like the work that needs to be done is it's got to happen whether the spotlight's on or not they don't and and what you're doing i mean because that's where it's at you know i'm telling you these kids are growing up and and they're being disabled by how many voices around them some of which are well-meaning but disabling and and you know i've seen those those children have amazing potential and they can do great things and i mean gosh look at look at some of the heroes we have um i was listening to um chloe valderi she's on twitter too and a podcast that she did with a guy benjamin voice and she talked about you know you know dr king is a founding father of america and she said it and it just the light went on for me i thought he certainly is and and um and frederick douglas is a founding father and a number of months ago i was reading a you know biography of frederick douglas and you know when you look at the adversity that he overcame you know please don't tell me that people who are born to difficult situations can't overcome their adversities when you look at someone like him now of course the exception proves the rule but i i'm again i've in this with so many voices out there in my opinion not being terribly helpful you know listening to you today inspired me and encouraged me and um you know took away my weariness of doing good so you know god is good god god brings these god brings gives us these meetings for a reason and um you know we we trust him that's the whole point and and people like it on my channel i get a lot of philosophical questions we do philosophy and that kind of stuff too but people like well what what what pastor what do you think a christian is and i say you know what a christian is a christian is someone who trusts jesus more than they trust themselves that's what a christian is um and yeah there's there's trinity and there's there's theology and there's doctrine and there's all that stuff too but finally finally we come and we say lord you know i'm i'm just me but i trust jesus and i'm going to trust jesus more than i trust myself and so that's that's what i tell my people let's trust jesus more than we trust ourselves because he is lord and he is good and someone who would allow himself to be brutalized and murdered and on the cross say father forgive them for they don't know what they do he's a man who can be trusted he loves he loves his enemies and what and as they possibly says why we were while we were still his enemies he died for us so follow that lamb wherever he goes that's that's what i tell the people yeah yeah word man words are wise this is good stuff right here i i so appreciate you you have you have just i have three amazing conversations today all of which will go up on my channel but you have you have so encouraged me and please send me all those links so i can put them in the notes so people can follow up and look at the great work that you're doing and i'm going to share this with the leadership of my church because i want them to hear what you have to say and i want the work that you're doing to bring hope to people who are struggling with with all of what they're struggling with so god bless you and i can i pray for you i don't often pray on my channel because it freaks out some of the atheists but i do it sometimes so let me pray for you yeah yeah lord i'm so grateful for tk and i i'm so grateful for the the serendipitous connection that we were able to make on that we were able to make on twitter and i i lord i thank you for his parents because they obviously are servants of yours who have who have who have poured their life into into this this other servant of yours and i thank you lord for their wisdom and their diligence and i thank you lord for the good fruit that you have poured into his life and lord i i see that you have you have gifted him tremendously and i am i am i am just gratified to look at the the little glimpse of his giftedness that i've been able to see this afternoon but i pray lord that as he works in in this in this very challenging and demanding field i pray lord that you give him much success i pray lord that he is able to to guide and mentor and inspire and make a way for for for many lord in in the black community that have struggled and been discouraged and where lord even well-intentioned voices are in some ways telling them that that that you have not given them the capacity to reach full maturity and potential and lord that's a that's a lie you have and i pray lord for the day that that that they got to put quotas on asian students because our colleges are just so filled with with young black men and women who are educated and entrepreneurial and starting new things and blazing new trails lord i i pray for that day because lord you know you know and and lord i pray as in the name in the words of jesus your kingdom come your will be done on earth as it is in heaven because i believe lord that that in fact the most christian demographic in america which is the african-american community that they may step into the leadership position that you have that you have that you have destined for them in this country they have in so many ways in many unrecognized ways but lord and i pray that that that you would that you would bless tk and give him a role in in elevating your people and helping them to thrive so hear my prayer lord in the name of jesus amen amen hey i really appreciate that
