 Hi, this is Paul and I'm sure my special guest will be in in a minute and I it's okay I failed in the control V last night to I sent them the email without the link which is of course the the deadly email misstep but I I'm always trying to figure out what to do with these Friday live streams not that I have any lack of ideas and often I'll bring on some of the the this little corner or this little cave or this little clearing regulars and up here here he's coming right now and I'll I'll I'll there is I'll let you in in a second I'm gonna first give the intro Rick and so lately I've been just be sieged with requests for oh can you do my podcast can I do a randos conversation and part of that is because I of course started the the supporter level of my channel and giving people basically saying okay well let's we'll do a conversation and I was I was unprepared for how fast the the membership section would grow and so I get an email from from someone I didn't know and a name I didn't recognize and it had a little sub thing on the email and probably what most of you don't know because you don't have YouTube channels is that there are companies out there that basically you can hire them to try to get you on podcast to try to get off zero and they seem to be in the Philippines and so I get these emails from people oh here's so and so and we think they'd be a great guest on your podcast and I hear that and I just think that's a load of BS you have no idea who my podcast is you have no idea who my audience is I love talking to people who are in the conversation I don't really have any patience for people who just want to sort of get on the channel because I've got a measly five-figure sub number so so I so and the way I am I explained this in an interview I did this week for another thing the first time someone asked me for something and I give them I try to give them a very kind no so usually with those those those that those companies that just ignore the first email and then they keep coming after me and then I give them a less kind to know a much more direct no in case because they they obviously didn't seem to hear the first no and then if they come back again that's when you know I told the story that at the church phone here we did church phones are just besieged by Christian telemarketers trying to sell us all of their services and and so then I give them the kind no and then they don't take no for an answer comes they come back then I give them the direct no and this one telemarketer called a third time and that's when I told her what I really thought and then she hung up and then I got a call from her supervisor telling me I was a bad Christian because I made her telemarketer cry so so I got this email and I basically said I I'm besieged with requests I you know I'm not really I really am interested in talking to people that are sort of within this little cut this little corner or this little clearing it was just watching Grimm Grizz and and so then the the the administrative assistant I was talking to her first and then I got a call from then I got an email from the guy says well I I know I've talked to Peugeot and I've talked to Ben Carson and I've talked to all of these famous people but I may not be as niche as Grimm Grizz and our Matthew Peugeot and I thought boy anybody who comes in and mentions Grimm Grizz's name I know you are paying attention so Rick you earned you earned your slot and I also I try to explain you know I usually have between two and four time slots a week that I can sort of give to people and but it was just so funny the way the thing rolled out and I also thought well you've done these big conversations before people I'm a little hesitant to bring people onto a live stream because the hive mind can be a little it's the internet so but I thought now this this guy will take it so let's let's do a Friday randos livestream with this guy who yeah very successfully got his way onto the show so Rick congratulations welcome hey Paul I am honored to be here I cut my chops in telemarketing so that was gonna be the next step to get on your show luckily the luckily they need knowing who Grimm Grizz was was enough for you was sufficient that that was sufficient because you know I I'm a I'm an ardent devotee to Grimm Grizz somebody cynically said well you only love Grimm Grizz because he keeps talking about your stuff well of course I I've got a sufficient level of narcissism as anyone does on the internet I suppose but I know I love I love Grimm Grizz for all sorts of other reasons because I personally I love my the friends I left love best tend to be those friends in low places so so well well let's get going Rick because I don't know you at all and you're you're sitting in a lot so and I also love paradox and so here's this guy he's talked to he's got a conversation with the show he's got a conversation with all of these big names and he mentions Grimm Grizz so who on earth are you well Paul I have a paradox I have a paradox it's you know it's it's said that that the paradox is most prevalent in the servant leader to leave it also to serve and that's also pin up with the idea of being a Christian leader and so you know how do you how do you bifurcate these two things where you love the inside the organization you love your people but you're willing to defend them with the ferocity that's necessary to to to protect them adequately right you've got a love inwardly and sometimes you've got a you got to be a little little ferocious a little little hateful not not not hating the satanic standpoint but but a little a little aggressive on the on the outside and so that's my life that's my life I mean I've got I've got big mean people to negotiate against you know eight to five and then I go home and I've got three little girls that were trying to sneak in milkshake trips so the mom doesn't find out and you know that's my life that's my life well let's let's begin like I usually begin with Randall's conversations tell me about the home you grew up in yeah so grew up down toward the Mexican border I live in Houston currently so I live halfway to the next I grew up halfway to the Mexican border little city called Corpus Christi and we grew up in a two-bedroom house my my mom was always always working my dad was always working he was out of out of work for a little while while we were growing up and we we basically followed him on the weekends to go paint paint flagpoles so he would go door-to-door with these banks and and give him a business card and go paint flagpoles and those kiddos would be in the car and and that's the way that we grew up and grew up in a in a Nazarene house so this is a Wesleyan Armenian tradition and to give you an idea idea how contrary they are to the the CRCs we I showed up at I showed up college Paul and the Mennonites were sending to their kids there I figured if the Mennonite kids are being sent here I'm in the wrong place I will not have any fun and so it was true it was true so what was you went to a Nazarene church what was church like for you as a kid yeah you know a hundred people every Sunday Sunday school you know I was the guy to hang out the programs there in between Sunday school and the service service you always had lunch after the same with the same people after church same thing on Wednesday night Bible studies we were Sunday nights as well we actually did this this really interesting thing called Bible quizzing and the Bible quizzing was was heavy on scriptural memory and so throughout my throughout my childhood I would memorize entire books of the Bible and so sporadically I memorized I think it was Luke John Galatians Ephesians Philippians Colossians Philemon first of second Corinthians and I can't repeat them all back right now but I you kind of lose that after you start on the next the next book but I remember at times John specifically sitting down with some friends and just quoted from start to finish word for word that's the sort of scriptural integrity my mom and my dad built into us when we were growing up it was it was fantastic and you can still use that as a treasure trove of knowledge and and passion even to this day yeah there's it's hard to it's hard to it's hard to oversell the value of scripture memorization it and and and since sort of biblical knowledge has really been falling out of our culture scripture memorization is just a powerful powerful thing and I know some people you know wonder about this well why on earth would you memorize anything when you have a cell phone you have everything in your pocket it's different when it's living inside your head and so that's that's really a powerful thing did you go to did you go to public school went to public school most the time my parents were able to afford us to just a private school for I think fifth and sixth grade and in public school and that's that's the way it was and so we you know we were out there in the public schools and and was little little nerdy kid and you know that's that's the way that we rolled and I was I was a band kid as well oh you're a band kid okay yeah okay yeah what was your what was your first besides painting flagpoles with your dad what was your first job that you got paid from some other people so I was actually the janitor at the church beginning at age 15 okay and you know I'm like I was that kid who would wait to the very last minute it's it's Saturday night at 11 o'clock I should be home because it's past my my curfew and I go over to the church and and don't realize that there's gonna be a funeral before the service the next morning and I walk in and there's already a body there so I'm a 15 year old cleaning this sanctuary at night by myself with a dead body in the room and that's when I figured I probably need to find a different career okay what was high school like for you yeah so band nerd I was I was around some really bad influences through the end of my junior year into my junior year I made the decision that I need to just cut them off and so my senior I live basically friendless just just cut them off cold like you know they would call looking for me they would ask about me and I just shut them down I'm still going to school with the guys but you know I had I had a friend when I was junior in high school that already had six kids as a junior in high school six kids I some other friends were drug dealers I'd thank God never got involved in that never did any drugs nothing like that but I remember playing pickup basketball Paul and and I'm sitting there and I'm it's my turn to rotate out and I'm sitting there because I've got to watch the weed for someone someone's gonna come pick it up and that's that's the sort of environment that I live I live with this this bifurcated life where I'm living that in my personal life but then at church I'm I'm in this the scriptural integrity was was there a moment that or an incident that happened that made you decide okay I've got to draw a line here I've got to turn around I've got to head in a different direction because I'm not I'm going with these people yeah so I think that it was I think it was in my junior year where I mentioned the book of John it was very very very very important to me and we had this thing called a world Bible-quizzing championship we needed winning it that year but to show how I guess how cut and dry it was or how systematic it was we actually memorized the concordance to the book of John that thing because you had to anticipate what the question was going to be after one word and one syllable generally if you're in yet like finish the question then you have to answer it is the way that it worked so because the first you know want to respond to the question had to finish the question so that's the way it was and that junior into my junior year was really striking it wasn't a it wasn't a spiritual encounter I would say but I think at that point I had got enough of the gospel into my brain into my heart that I realized I got to be cold-blooded about this and I and I was okay what did you do after high school yeah so went to college at Southern Azure University in Oklahoma City and can group in Corpus Christi major in in trumpet performance and music business so I have a lot of a lot of music theory music composition things like that that we had to take them and I didn't mean my wife my senior year walks into the band hall and come to find out she grew up down in Corpus Christi with me as well and I just never met her before so we both grew up in the exact same place I knew her sister she knew my sister but we had never we had never met just a total God thing we've been married 21 years and and so we were up there started the first business one summer down in Corpus Christi so I was home for summer break and from Oklahoma City so Oklahoma City to Corpus Christi is a nine-hour drive and so started the business one summer in Corpus Christi just going door-to-door just asking for business was able to hire a couple people at the end of the summer and I would drive back and forth every week so Thursday classes would end in Oklahoma City I would drive the nine hours back to Corpus Friday I would see clients Saturday I would train staff Sundays I would drive back I did that every week for 18 months until we finally both graduated and moved down to Corpus Christi Wow well what kind of business did you start it was a facility manager so for commercial companies we would give them one one price so if you need like a roof replaced or HVAC unit replaced anything like that that went out over that year we would cover the cost for it and so it was something that I had some knowledge about and we would we would get in that it was it was a pretty a pretty good business that's interesting so well talk to me about how that business works because obviously it's you know because there are different kinds of businesses that do the sort of thing and because I mean because I'm a pastor of a church I know about you know HVAC systems going out plumbing issues I mean I know a lot of church planters that sit there and they're like oh gosh I wish I had a facility and there are times it's like yeah you yeah facilities awful nice because you're all set up on Sunday even if you have to rent it out just to make ends meet but at the same time you have this facility and the parking lot needs to be refit fixed or there's an HVAC system that goes out so so your business was basically for for a certain price we're gonna cover we're basically gonna ensure that you don't have to have these big costs and so you basically can budget our our price into your budget and know what you spend so instead of like trying to save money and then whoop we got to spend a ton on a parking lot or a thing so I'm curious how do you as a business figure out that number because to me that would seem I mean that's that's whether your business is gonna live or die because if you get that number right you'll be okay you get that number wrong some church that you've contracted with loses their HVAC and it's gonna cost 30 grand and suddenly your business is like you're on for that 30 grand and it's like you get two or three of those and you're done so yeah business like that so it's it's very much like like the actuarial business and insurance right you you know exactly how long the light bulb lasts and how long a specific brand of compressor lasts inside of an HVAC unit you know all these things and you have master spreadsheets that just figure that out what that what that probability of going out would be you also you know you also take care of some of the recurring needs the dailies needs so like the the cleaning and the maintenance and the engineering and the landscaping and all that sort of thing because you can get eyes on the problems a lot sooner right you know if you're not if you're not looking at it every day you really don't know what's going And you may be six months down the road maybe too foregone to repair it has to be replaced and so that that's it's it's a predictive maintenance business essentially what it was and and so it it's a it's risk but you get paid for risk if you're able to measure it correctly. So I obviously we've never met until now but just listening to your story and and looking at you and getting some just trying to just trying to cold read you to what degree did did your parents did your parents I mean it seems like from your story your parents knew they had to work hard to make ends meet and you're a kid growing up you learned something from them that hey uh life life is a hustle I mean life you have to you you sit around in life I mean you find lots of proverbs in the book of Proverbs about this. Tell me about that relationship about watching your parents because quite obviously from a very young age you were a go-getter because I knew a lot of people in college and I don't know anybody I knew a few people who did something like you did but but people like you are kind of a rare breed because most college students on the weekend are not even studying so you know talk to me about how that growing up sort of put you on a track to where even in college you're you're already you're already starting a a pretty sophisticated business. Yeah yeah just for full clarity I was a C&B student in high school and college I never read a complete book in fact I would basically I would basically take those those those yellow books those summary books I think it's what they were back then yeah and I would skim those if I if I was gonna be a good student that that week and so I just had no care for for formalized education now I'm an avid reader now but back then that's the way it was now my parents really operated like a like a cohesive unit so when my dad was out of work for a number of years my mom picked up a second full-time job and then she also had a part-time job on the weekend so I remember very very vividly she would go into a regular job at 6 a.m. in the morning you know work till 3 come home see some see some clients there she was a nurse so she would she would either do tell some you know phone screenings things like that and then she would work an overnight shift in our back bedroom with a phone line there and a computer and she would take calls from doctors offices all night long the next morning she'd get back up and do it again then on Saturdays she would work a full day I don't know if it's a 16 hour day or 20 hour day whatever it was to have a that have this third income going as well and they were just they were just you know a great a great partnership and how it worked they never I don't think I ever heard him discuss how they would make that make that work but they were just they were they were hustlers and they and they realized that you know I remember one summer my dad and I had to figure out what to do and our job for that summer was we would go go around to garage sales and we would ask the people that are on the garage sales you have any you have any boxes of old watches like from a dad or granddad or something like that and they would say oh yeah we've got this box and they would bring it out and we would we would basically eye it and appraise whether or not it was real we would buy it there and then go sell it at a pawn shop or go sell it to a dealer and so we traded like like like Indian traders for entire summer just to just to pay the bills and you've got it and I remember I remember my wife probably watches I remember dumpster diving too I remember them drop pulling up in the back of a grocery store and us kids would jump in the in the dumpster and look for those den it cans that they would throw out that's that's how we rolled yep what did you learn about marriage by watching your parents marriage wow great question great question that if you love someone that you don't necessarily need to articulate you should articulate it but you don't necessarily need to articulate it your work and your commitment and your sacrifice mean more than flowers meaning more than gifts mmm and the very giving of oneself is the highest possible gift that you give and that that's really that's really what I saw my parents are not lovey-dovey towards one another they hang out all the time they go to lunch every day I mean they're together but you know they're not they're all over yeah yeah no and one of the things that I think people don't realize is that there are actually lots of ways to have a good marriage and and I think we get presented oh this is the formula for a good marriage it's like well that's probably a formula for a good marriage but there are actually a lot of different ways for a good marriage so when you met the woman who would become your well let me ask you this did you were you were you because a lot of my audience are single men so were you were you a hit with the ladies or were you the kind of guy that sort of you know well talk to me about you as a single guy yeah I was very single I was very very very single yes I was not I was not the I was not the not the ladies man by any source of the manager I mean I had opportunities and I just I just wasn't interested I just wasn't interested by what I saw and then when my wife walked I remember my wife walker to the band hall that one day and it was like a it was like a ray of sunshine and I'm like that's the woman for me and we never we never look back it is amazing and there there are there are there are psychology books on this topic it is amazing how often that dynamic happens I remember the first moment I laid eyes on the woman that became my wife I remember that moment I remember exactly when it was where it was what she was wearing I mean that picture is in my mind now I didn't think at that moment she's gonna be my wife but I saw her and I paid attention and actually I didn't get to meet her until about eight nine months later and then I met her again another six or seven months later and so so when you she walked into the band hall what happened what did you say what did you do did you wait did I mean obviously you strike me now you strike me as the kind of guy who probably married up so I'm not no offense here but it's just just an impression because I know I did so yes oh yes yes yes I so I was a little bit too nervous to speak to her now I'm a senior she's a freshman I'm a little sooner sit to speak to her I did not ask her out I sat behind her in bands so she was a saxophone player tenor sax player I was trumpet player so I sat behind her I was you know like those are beautiful ears there's a beautiful feet but that's all I can see but I like what I see and and so that's what we were finally about three months into school I think was October November they had a kind of a Sadie Hawkins weekend where the girls asked the guys out and she asked me out this freshman asked me out and and come to fight come to find out she was from a from a very very great family she was a fifth generation Nazarene she had Nazarene pastors in her in her background her family were farmers and just very very avid entrepreneurs just just very very gifted deal makers who loved the Lord and and it's just it's just a wonderful family to be a part of now but I definitely married up that's that's for sure so how long until you started dating and then you married you're a senior so you probably wanted to get on with life did did you marry before she finished school yes we married about a semester before she finished okay and then and then we relocated back to Corpus so by that time I probably was up to maybe 20 or 30 employees in the business and so I needed to get back to Corpus to take care of things okay and then pursuant to the next four years it grew pretty dramatically up to 400 W2D employees and so that that first four years of marriage was a lot of work on the on the professional front well part of part of getting married is you know you have this first draft that you inherited from your parents and your parents were obviously an an economic economic partnership that they worked hard to survive they took care what was it like when you got married in terms of because part of things when you get married you has these two first drafts that you're probably not even aware just of these assumptions about what marriage is gonna be and then you come and you realize I married someone who has a different assumption about what marriage was what was that like for you yeah so for I'll say for my wife first she married me and then she realized that she basically married her ultra entrepreneurial ultra aggressive dad she basically oh other and so usual no no no so this so then the I wouldn't say the corrective procedures began but but I think there was there was definitely some warning like a you're sounding a little bit too much like my dad or you're sounding a little bit too much like this maybe you can tip her down a little bit those sorts of things and I needed them I needed a big time now from my perspective as well a little bit context so my mom comes from a couple who were married for I don't know 60 60 or something like that my father comes from a family where his father drank himself to death and so did his father and his father so he comes from three generations of men that drank themselves to death my dad was first generation who stopped drinking yeah and so and so we've kind of have that I guess in our blood if that's a proper thing to say or not but but me knowing that that's in my background I play it really really safe like I'd never drink I never smoke I have such addictive personality especially with work I'm gonna go all in like yeah man if I if I had my first drink today I also have my last drink today because I'll be dead by mid-dive that's just my personality and so I can't I can't chance it but she knows this going in and so and so from my background we look at the two paternal figures as the dominating voices in our marriage and of course I'm kind of the crux at that so yeah I'm the one that also that has to be the safest possible husband but also the most provisional type of husband because she's used to a certain lifestyle certain workload a certain certain sort of sort of set of benefits that are that are accrued to that okay okay and and then so you're you've got this business which is a it's a it's a one of the things I one of the things I really love about being a pastor and it's not so much anymore because my church is you know not a lot of people in my church have day jobs anymore they're almost all retired at least the older crew one of the things I always enjoyed being a pastor was getting a set getting a chance to get to know people because it gave me a chance to get to know their work so one of one of my favorite people in the church that is now passed on he was a rice farmer and you know it really gave me a chance to learn about if far you know people think of farmers as you know sort of hayseeds out there but farmers are fierce business people if you're not if you're not a fierce business person as a farmer you will be an ex-farmer or you will be a hobby farmer because farming farming is a is a really it's a really sharp business so you obviously you're a go-getter you're a business guy you get this you get this company going up it's a it's a it's a and the thing grows big and so now in a sense like your parents you're a hustler but you're successful I mean you're probably you're I mean I'm sure you're watching that business and you're making sure you know you're making sure that the business is going well you're working hard what what's what's it like making that transition from you're still a hustler but you're succeeding in a way that probably your parents didn't what was that like for you yeah so I never met anyone growing up that had a company of a hundred people low-loan 400 and and the way that I realized that I had 400 employees was one year I was when I was 26 we were sending out the WT's you have to you have to mail them out right so we had them all printed up and I'm there stuffing envelopes and I have to figure out how many stamps I'm gonna buy to go mail them out and start counting them and I I'm over 400 and I'm like this is this is interesting but I don't have an office I don't have a management team I'm running this thing out of out of a coffee shop and my laptop yeah and so I don't have a clue I don't know who to go to and so luckily my my wife's father is there eventually enabled to to help walk me through that till got put other people in my life but that's that changed the paradigm now about three years after I started I was actually able to hire my dad away from his other employer so my dad actually worked with me for probably ten ten to twelve years something like that until he retired for the first time that's good so it was a great thing Paul man I remember I remember he had a company truck and it was gonna be like this is the Sunday night that he's gonna he's gonna retire he's gonna quit his job and come work with me so we can we can hang out all day and we're driving out there we're driving out there and he goes and he goes there's like a little drop box and at the office and he goes and and and puts the keys in there and and he locks up it's hard sorry locked up he can't get the keys back and he comes and sits in the car and we just kind of breathe for a second before we leave like what what just happened what just happened and and we've been we we just had the best time because we got to talk every it gave us a reason to talk every day and it was it was probably one of the most wonderful decades of my entire life he's still he's still alive and we still work on some other projects together but it was it was just just a huge blessing it was a little bit awkward to sign my dad's paychecks I'll say that yeah yeah yeah but it's it's we didn't make it awkward we didn't make it awkward it just it just he and I and that's kind of relationship that we've got oh that's tremendous I was in part of what's going on in this little corner these little live streams and Luke Thompson had a live stream yesterday and he starts talking about his father who was an iron worker and he was building these power plants up in South Dakota and again in terms of what has sort of grown around me it's mostly men and and so you know there's there's lots of daddy issues and and sometimes good sometimes bad and so I think I think that's a that's a beautiful story so so how did how did having a big what did you learn by having a big company so the first thing was that I had more responsibility than I really wanted it was a lot of headache it was a lot of headache so I began to build out the management team I thought it would make my life easier and it really didn't it's supposed to but it really didn't and so we began actually outsourcing those as possible closing down a lot of markets and and just just trying to get streamlined with that and so over a number of years we got streamlined and we didn't making a lot more money at 40 than we did 400 just because of the efficiencies just because of the efficiencies and so you outsource the lowest margin work and focus on the highest margin work and so we eventually spun that so we knew how to operate buildings and and manager costs yeah we spun that added a property accounting service there added leasing service there added third-party like brokerage investment advisory there and then we were approached by a group of 11 family offices very very wealthy family offices who who said hey we want to partner with you and let's go buy some properties and so we've been buying commercial real estate with them along because they knew I knew what I was doing yeah and so and so that was something totally unexpected but it became by way of having that large company see the need to downsize it so you could focus on the more important elements of what it means to operate a commercial property for instance and from there using that as a sort of an attractive type of asset attractive type of platform through which we could build relationships relationships that were higher value yeah and so that that's what we've been doing yeah that that I think is actually I you know so I have all these new I am the epitome of a of a one-horse shop here because I mean really I do everything at this church we got someone else to do the janitorial but with even with a lot of the little things that we have tiny little little jobs that people do I often wind up having to sort of make sure those jobs work and and so then people are often but I have a lot of I have friends who have larger churches and so have staff and I was actually talking about with my wife about this this morning because it's like people are like well you really need to hire someone and it's like people this is a it's a really careful dance and I was just watching Marquis Brownlee who just did a video on all these people quitting YouTube and the reason they quit YouTube is they start out doing YouTube and being youtubers because they really enjoy it but the bigger the channel goes the more they realize well I can't manage it so then they bring in people and and very quickly you wind up being a manager and this happens to a lot of pastors because if you're a if you're a sharp pastor and a successful pastor and your church is growing very quickly many of the things that made you successful as a pastor are not really the gift mix or the job that you need to maintain a large congregation and so as a person you really have to sit down and think about now now who really am I and what am I called to do and what do I want to do and and that's that's a little countercultural because the culture usually says grow for growth's sake and and really you have to ask well what what exactly is the thing that I need to grow and who exactly am I and what exactly is my calling and then what does that path look like and that story you just told I think really I think nicely sort of showed oh you've you've got to pay attention because everyone around you is celebrating oh you have 400 employees and you're managing all of these properties and and you take a step back and you have to say wait a minute what what what what just happened to my life this business has colonized me so was there an incident or something that sort of you got to a point and you said you had an aha moment what what was that about it was a very skinny well-dressed man that ascended to the presidency that put into place this rule that if you have over 50 employees you're gonna pay for health care for all of them and so think about that think about I'm very careful my California friends over there I know I know everyone's a big Gavid fan but but I want to be very careful be very politically correct here you know I almost I almost I almost tweeted you last night Paul that I heard Martin Shaw was able to drop the f-bomb twice on your program a couple of days ago so and so that I'm actually gonna work on my Brits tonight and I showed that tweet to my wife before I sent it she said Rick saying Britt is probably offensive to some people and so she said promise me that you're not gonna say Britt on the program tomorrow so I'm not saying Britt I'm not saying Britt so I don't be I won't be divisive here so so you know this this very well-dressed very very well-mannered very polished man comes into present scenes I'm gonna penalize every company over 50 fact you're gonna get health insurance for all of them now you do the math do the math so you've got so let's say you've got 400 you've got to pay for 350 people's health care insurance for that 50 first employee so if you can get below the 50 yeah you you get rid of all that expense yeah you get rid of all of it yeah and I'm no fool I'm gonna put it on a spreadsheet and this in the spreadsheet it didn't it didn't make any sense yeah and so and so that that was the big deciding factor around this time as well someone had given me a book by Randy Alcorn called the treasure principle you've probably seen that little that little pamphlet there I was on a I was on a flight and it's centered around this this little little nothing of a verse Luke 1234 that where your treasure is there your heart will be also that the that the heart follows the treasure and I started thinking well my treasure is my time and my money and they're all wrapped up in these in these people here that don't really care about me if I die today they're gonna go work somewhere else no big deal and so and so I began a process of giving away as much as I could possibly afford to and so it for for many years it was it was half my income and just just the way the tax brackets worked out in the AGI caps you really really can't give much more than that away for too many years in a row and so as I started to do that I began being approached by organizations to whom we were helping who asked me to help strategically like in a board role or advisory role consulting role and through that process I began getting very involved in some in some nonprofit organizations and so my schedule instead of working 16 hours a day on the business I would work eight hours down the business plus eight hours a day doing nonprofit work and that really helped right the ship right you you can get some some true perspective when you're not just looking at one thing and so that's that's help and there are fungible skills moving back and forth between the two worlds there they're quite fungible interesting so you you down you downsize your business well well you know the so the hive minds the hive minds blowing up and you know you've you've you've offended the guy who got you in here so let's let's let's not let's let's not let elephants stay in the room let's talk about health care because this is a this is a this is a touchy thing in America because unlike say Canada or or the Brits there I said it you know you know I've got some I've got some nieces who are working they're working retail and it's a it's a difficult it's a difficult dance because I understand for the sake of these businesses they've got low-skill employees and they they want to sort of maximize with respect to these low-skill employees and so all right so keep them under a certain number of hours so they don't have to pay health insurance keep them under certain hours but then then the business are also sort of saying well we want you available and I actually work with a lot of people come sort of in this because I work with a lot of poor people well we want you to be available all the time but we're only gonna give you 20 hours a week so so talk to me about because what's interesting is and and this is why I think sort of the shallow divide that American politics works on is is not what people think it is because you grew up on both sides of this because and this is also my impression that I know I know a fair number of successful successful business people that are successful as business people because they've also known poverty so so talk to me about you know this is not really a political channel but talk to me about talk to me about health care because I know another successful business guy in northwest Iowa who sort of had the reverse idea he was a he was a scientist and he was a you know he had multiple PhDs and he would build these businesses and he basically would outcompete the Chinese and pharmaceuticals but he he not only wanted to make sure his all of employees had health care he also wanted to make sure that all of his employees had enough money so their kids could go to Christian school so I mean talk to me about how this works in your mind because you're clearly a committed Christian and you clearly care about people and you know about poverty but when I hear people work with this it's I often hear there are different strategies with respect to these needs and employment and poverty so talk to me a little bit about this so so two two quick notes what those of context that that are not patently obvious so first thing keep in mind that we're predominantly down next to the Mexican border and this is this is at an early time where he verify things like that were not prevalent so you're competing against companies that are hiring illegal not not illegal but undocumented I said I forgot what they were called 20 years ago but they were called a different thing that they're called now so my apologies for that the second 50 people they were offered cash that was that was between 500 and a thousand dollars a month so they could go actually on the health care exchange and buy their own health care insurance out of the 50 people that did that I was the only one that did it no one wanted health insurance because it sucked it was horrible health care insurance yeah so they kept the cash yeah so so we so those are those are two things I should have mentioned up front but that's that's what was happening in the background health insurance this is an issue that both parties have botched yeah they both botch yeah the the first administration it was too big of a program and they just did not have the competency in the administration to pull it off so so what I mean what I mean that's not a political statement it's a it's a it's an operational statement that the value that we get when we pay say a thousand dollars a month for health insurance is not equal to a thousand dollars a month it's not even equal to five hundred dollars a month if there's so much fluff there's so much regulation there's so much lack of competition there that it's just not a value so you're not getting the value in exchange that that's my big issue with with the program if you got value in exchange for that that expense that'd be a different thing but you don't and it's a part it's a problem of both parties because there have been both parties in in office since then that that have not fixed it it's too big of a problem it's just too big of a problem and it takes it's it can't be fixed in four years I think you need probably a full eight years to fix it we might guess you might be 16 or 20 actually because it is a it is a huge problem for us yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so it's a it's a it's more of a statement of economics and and the cost-benefit analysis okay so so you know us knowing that our competitors were not going to get it because they were hiring undocumented people that were not that they were going to report anyway that it you know going to our clients are kind of say we're gonna let you guys go if you if you have to add this cost back in yeah and so we're gonna we're not gonna take losses it's not it's not like we're gonna take less money we're not gonna pay money to to to people so that they can do unprofitable workforce so we can lose money it just it's a mathematical decision it's not it's not an ethical decision yeah good good good I'm glad we you know because because because what happens sometimes with a conversation is especially and this is part of the thing about a live stream is at least I can be a little responsive to the hive mind there and figure out what's going on and and these are these are issues that trip people up and and they don't part of the reason I do the conversations the way I do is that you get to some of these stumbling blocks and of course you know the biblical reference to that and and suddenly people lose sight of the good because their attention all goes to oh he said this about healthcare I don't want to listen to him I think that's kind of a stupid way to go about life so you you downsize your business you you you start you start radically giving away your you know you start radically giving away and and then you begin and I'm sure one of the things that you began to run into is that that oh if a business is poorly managed it'll usually go under if a Christian ministry is poorly managed it will it's almost like the government it'll get bailed out just because of the the the the mercy of people out there so so so talk to me about this transition you made from saying okay you know I've already succeeded in business I know how to run a business I'm I'm very interested in what's going out there in terms of kingdom work but I really need see the need for leadership development tell me is there was there a moment or an event or something that happened that sort of turns your light on with respect to this absolutely absolutely so I came in in my 20s to an organization that was a evangelical type of organization they had about 800 staff in a number of countries that that did a lot of really good work and one of their measurements was how many additional people they could hire they had them in teams and these were if you're familiar with the Jesus film movement through campus it's one of those and so they would set out these teams and obviously the more teams you have the more presentations of the gospel that are that are being made and so and so that was their primary statistic now they would also count conversions in church plants and things like that that were really really important but the teams model was a little bit heartening because they would not measure the economics on the other side of that and so some you know me conceptually knowing that I could do more with a tenth of the people I I suspected you might be able to do more with it with less people or at least with less resources and so they they eventually put me in charge of it was a 40 person board and they basically they eventually put me as chairman of the development so we were in charge of all the fundraising so we would we would host 10 galas all over the country we would host 10 or 15 mission trips where we bring donors down to see different parts of the world that sort of thing and I got really good at doing the difficult thing remember like I mentioned I did some telemarketing when I was growing up that and I'm just going door to door so I pride myself in doing the uncomfortable thing that no one else wants to do and that thing in that case was asking people for money especially people that were very very formidable by their by their life experiences mostly these people were very wealthy because competency is reflected in in wealth in the secular community and so and so I got the chance to be able to talk to people's and I I wouldn't say I fixed the problem but I made it a lot more endurable and reinforce that area of the of the organization and gradually able to bring other people on I eventually became chairman of that organization we scaled up to 2300 team members by the time I left it took about 10 years to do all that and so and so that was one of the principles is number one you've got to do what you don't want to do because no one else wants to do it and then and then if you can do that if you can do that you're in a stronger stronger position and then number two you can do more with less and so and so we took those two principles and and really really saw that come to fruition in that organization okay okay well it's interesting because and again I have to sort of cold read you because we don't you know this is what we know of each what I know of you is what we've got going here and I feel like a stalker here because I've been watching you on YouTube for at least the last year or two okay I'm used to that asymmetry I'm used to that asymmetry it's also my impression listen to your story that and I've known other people like you I mean my father spent 36 years in his first church I've been 26 years in this church you're the kind of guy that keeps moving you keep starting things you have a thing over here you have a thing over there you have a thing over there um talk to me about what it's like inside of you when you have the sense of okay I'm gonna do this new thing or I'm gonna move on or I'm gonna leave this thing because often starting a new thing is easy leaving a thing is a lot harder tell me about that sort of thing yeah so business-wise the the business we have now is just a continuity from what we've had over the last 26 years from that that's the way that I view it like there's there's add-ons there's bolt-ons there's rebrands that sort of thing we never really went out of business we never really did anything that was a you know you fire everyone that sort of thing or sell everything but it seems cotton nudists and from my perspective now for the nonprofit perspective a lot of times these have you know term limits or you have to roll off after certain time periods and so yeah and so that's been a lot of it sometimes I'll you'll just find something that you just don't like structurally about the organization that you don't realize some some hidden clause in the bylaws that that allows someone to do something that you you perceive is is unethical and so and so you have the opportunity to be either to destroy the organization bring it down by sheer force or you can just walk away and I've done that I've done that it pains me to do a lot of work for really great organizations find something you don't like that you know is not you know it's not right and you just walk away you just kind of just eat it just swallow up swallow up the problem yeah yeah yeah so well what's what's your I mean we'll take questions from the hive mind and today's gonna be an interesting I can tell already because well let me let me talk about these divides I think any this this will this will be controversial too I think any I think any space in which real things are happening there are going to be divides you can't you can't deal with real things without dealing with contradictions because that's kind of the way the world is is is shaped for us right now so so so what are you so what are you what are you doing now and well let me let me go this how on earth did you find me and why on earth did you want to talk to me so I interviewed Jonathan pageau on my show maybe about two years ago okay and and and so I got to know Jonathan through that and then he just he just took off like a rocket ship yeah right around that period and no looking back and so I really enjoyed that conversation and I'm a I mentioned I never really read in high school or college I pivoted since then so you know I'll come into the office and I'll read my Bible for an hour every morning that I'll read something else for another hour and so I've gotten more thoughtful and so I think the the algorithm has picked that up and sent me what I should be watching and so and so you know you eventually showed up and and so never never really look back there now day to day is a little bit different now so I'm focused on on writing a book that I hope to release the middle of this year I'm also working on a on a new business launch which is which is sort of a succession of some of our other business pursuits in the financial space and then and then I'm I'm working on just becoming a better person a number of years ago I used to sit down or for a number of years I've sat down every year to do my annual planning and I always would list the things that I want to do this year I want to hire this many people I want to fire this many people I want to do this I want to do that and so about two years ago Paul the Holy Spirit told me that I don't want you to do something I want you to become someone and someone very specific and so that thought that revelation is dominated my thinking for the past probably two years it's not what you do it's what you become that matters it's it's the toes are in type of type of thought that it's not what you do that makes you whole it's why you do it it's that sort of thinking and so that's really pervaded invaded my mind and my life over the last couple of years and I want more of it I noticed so you know I hadn't heard of you at all so then I you know you'd sent me some links so then I went to your YouTube channel I looked through a bunch of things and that very much that very much does seem to be I mean you're playing around with YouTube too you're making videos you're talking to people you for a while you had sort of a your Peugeot conversation was sort of you had a sort of from the mansion type thing and then lately things have changed talk to me about how you're using YouTube to become something to grow in who you are rather than what you do yeah so the first 12 episodes was kind of a season of conversations and it culminated in a series of live live audience events here at this thing we call the mansion that's about a that's about a 13,000 square foot building we've got is a 7,000 square foot lounge so it's great for parties yeah this is where our offices are up here okay just for context yeah and at the end of that my marketing lead came to me and said Rick I want to show you the budget because we didn't plan on doing a series of podcasts here and this year for the budget I want to show you what what your show cost now the very final show was Don Trump jr. we it was it was a nonprofit it was a fundraiser for a non-profit faith-based nonprofit that he agreed to come and I agreed to to make a contribution to the nonprofit so he didn't really benefit I didn't benefit we just were kind of having fun we invited friends had open bar had valet has secret service here for five days it was it was kind of a nutso type of thing well so those sorts of things started happening so she shows me the budget we spent a quarter of a million dollars on 12 episodes I mean we had six cameras if you if you if you watch the that last Don jr. one we've got five or six cameras on his intro it's we were just doing stupid stupid things and so so I cut it off I cut it off after that so guys this is this is this is too much I know we're having fun but we're just we're just not gonna do this and so I took about a year off and then I started to just hit the hit the record button and just think through some different things that I was learning about you'll see some you see some ebbs and flows where we would hire consultants and they would say hey Rick we need to talk about business we need to talk about this great building that you bought where you made millions of dollars here that kind of stuff just a couple of those in there I feel very uncomfortable with those things but they they said that's what the algorithm wants to see so I'm thinking I'm thinking well I'm just gonna do what the what the professionals want and the algorithm really didn't give a give a give a crap about it so so you'll see those sorts of things in there and so it's just sort of an experimentation I actually enjoy going on other people's programs I've probably been on maybe 12 to 15 other people's programs in the past 60 days or so maybe 90 days and that's a lot more funded the conversation is a lot more pleasurable from in fact I was out there in California two weeks ago if you know the Christian rapper Ruslan yeah yeah I met him at ARC yeah yeah yeah very cool guy I mean he I mean he may have a million followers across all of his different platforms but like really cool guys so I was I was there he interviewed me his studio there and just just really cool guy and so I'm doing fun things like that that's what that's what I enjoy and so you know I'll you know I'll get up at 330 the morning in the office by 415 and I'll put in put in 12 hours man I'm I'm calling it quits because I want to be home to be with my daughters in the evening so that's that's what's happening these days okay okay well I will start taking we'll start taking questions from the hive mind here anything else in terms of what so you got this YouTube channel going you're talking about CS Lewis you're talking about a lot of things like that what's what's what do you what do you sense is I mean besides obviously keeping your businesses running being on boards of not-for-profits what do you sense is sort of your calling these days to help inform men that are in their 20s and 30s and looking for purpose and looking looking for a way to have purpose and also have high levels of competency at the same time that's that's really who I who I think that I'm called a minister to now give me a dad of three girls I'm thinking about this for their future husbands I've got to figure out a framework where I can coach these guys because the odds that they're gonna hire someone that they're gonna marry someone like me are very very low and the odds that they're gonna want to take advice from someone like me are very very low and so I've got to be able to change the local church my local community I just started hosting a couple of CEO small groups of decent sized CEOs and so we're doing that I'm just trying to be effective I'm trying to think about what will be still around in a hundred or five hundred years and so the best thing I can get is I can disciple men and I can write a book okay okay well I'm gonna know so if anybody in the hive mind wants to ask a question you can put question in all caps so I can see it or you can do a super chat because that gets colored so I can see it and so Anselman who is our Scott who has been with the channel almost from the beginning usually has a theological side to his questions he asked has the Nazarene Church significantly changed in recent years away from its original holiness ethos so I left the Nazarene Church maybe 15 years ago so I'm a Southern Baptist deacon now they they are still very entrenched in the holiness tradition and for those for those that aren't familiar with this Westland Armenian system they believe you if you kind of look at the Pauline you know Romans 828 through 30 they would just say that the holiness the sanctification comes in this life and you can live months and even years and steeped in Holiness where you're never gonna sin so they're they're they're barrier for sinning seems to be a little bit less or assuming it seems to be a little bit higher than than what ours would be in a reformed tradition okay okay so so you said Southern Baptist and reform there's been a big movement of reformed thinking and attention going on in the Southern Baptist is is that sort of where you've been at or talk to me about that yeah so when Diaz the same question yeah so I go to a very conservative Southern Baptist Commission Church there were some very liberal ones so I was in Manhattan a couple weeks ago my wife and I are sitting at dinner there is a older man and younger man sitting at dinner next to us I get up to go to the restroom they started conversation with my wife I come back he's wants to know why I'm not drinking I say I'm a Baptist Deacon he says I'm a Baptist Deacon too come to find out this is an older man in a homosexual relationship the younger man and and he said I'm a Baptist Deacon too in fact he was chairman of the Deacons he said at Montgomery Alabama first Baptist I think is where he said for three years and they've got a female senior pastor it's it's I mean it's probably a lot like you would see in a lot of CRC I would imagine these days but but it just it you're sort of in the Bible belt still and you have that you just ricks you're right off right off the bat and that he was chairman of the Deacons for three years and so you see some you see some movement happening there's a lot of pressure happening and so it's up to the individual churches to decide for themselves where and how they want to want to maneuver around these things yeah we've had we've had some some lightening up on the alcohol issue in our own church or the past year or two I'm not happy about it but you know I'm again I'm it's not gonna change my activity anyway yeah yeah well and you know I want to I want to I I had it I suspected you were gonna be one of my more controversial guests here so I'm really glad it's a live stream because I you know anybody anybody who's watched this channel enough should know something about me in which I'm not a I'm not afraid of conflict I conflict is important and so and and so you get into Christianity is a very live thing and so questions I mean t totalism was a major issue at the end of the 19th century that deeply impacted certain Christian denominations the Christian from church has never been sort of a t total religion but my grandmother my father's mother watched two of her brothers die of alcoholism and so she I mean every Christian from church never had a thing against alcohol but there's no alcohol in her home because you know and so alcoholism very you know and and watching sort of this the new young and reform reformed movement saw you know pubs and pints and and these kinds of things and it's just interesting watching these different waves go through the culture where where something like you know something like people figuring out how are we to think about alcohol all right so Chad Chad people are testing you now so and again I like I said at the beginning I said my impression of this guy he's not shy you can if you disagree with him you know this is sort of you kind of remind me a little bit of not Hank I watched Hank and Jacob go at it in the comment section over over health care because both of them are in insurance so it was really interesting watching them debate insurance but I thought this is not a guy who's gonna this is not a guy who's gonna sort of say oh they were mean to me and Paul Van der Klee's life no this is not that guy so here you go here's a test question from Chad could you offer some of your favorite member favorite member berries and he asks me to not except I have to say though before Rick showed me a year ago I probably could not answer this question either so he's he's sniffing you out culturally so some of your favorite member berries I have no clue what that is South I know okay know what South Park is I do know what South Park is yes you see as the kind of guy who probably watches almost no television no TV I don't have time for it I figured as much I figured that is so member berries are this little meme on South Park where you know the dynamic though because they nail it perfectly remember happy days remember you know it's just people when they get together they sort of form this little this little nostalgic community over something so Chad Chad's basically trying to figure out if you're if you're a South Park guy okay any other questions Clint D has another question here ask what Chad asked tell it no no no you can't redo Chad's question come on people on the if you say question I'm probably gonna put it up unless you're just being a troll can you tell us about your wife and your marriage so Gabby and he's already talked a bit about about I don't know if you saw it earlier but his parents we talked about his parents marriage talked about his bar you've been married 21 years well what have you learned in marriage if you're humble enough it keeps getting better it just keeps getting better and I am in I am so in love with my wife it's it's unfathomable I wouldn't if if you asked if you told me as a 50 year old man when I was in college that this kind of love was possible I would not believe you I would say you're just saying that just to be a good example and I tell you what she's incredible she's incredible I don't know what she's doing with me but we had the best time together and I would not I would not trade that for the she is literally the most most valuable most important thing in my life and and just phenomenal marriage is fantastic if you find the right woman and you're humble enough to realize that now now my wife also says this she says Rick you're wrong 90% of the time and I said I'll take it that means I'm right 10% of the time you know you got to take what you get Paul it's better than a clock oh yeah right twice at the broken clock all right next question from Grizz so so Grizz has some skepticism about how on earth did you drop how on earth did you drop his name you must have you must have encountered the Grizz and somehow tell me about tell me about that so I'll go brought me to you but Grizz channeled quite a bit smaller so you dropped his name so how did you know about Grimm Grizz I guess the algorithm showed him to me at one point I like I do know I think you I think you just quoted his his little tagline on his YouTube channel a second ago about the clock being being right or wrong half you know half the time but yeah yeah just just found him and got a chance to talk to him I think we follow maybe follow each other on Twitter now very recently and and so yeah just just enjoy I mean it's he he is so unique that I really really I really enjoy that just sort of that different different perspective I think he had that road trip a few days ago whenever that was yeah yeah just little shots I'm like hey this is this is just good watching this is just good I agree I I know there's a lot of channels that have sprung up because of me but I knew great I when Grizz Grizz Grimm Grizz goes live streaming if I'm if I'm if I have eyes to be available I I catch it and if I don't catch it then I can you know I can just sort of find the sermon at the end I Taiyo I think this is gonna be an easy one for him oh maybe not at ease oh why do you believe in the resurrection I see it everywhere I see it everywhere why do I want to believe in the resurrection resurrection is that if it happened for one of us anything's possible for the rest of us and and so and so that's my motivation to believe in it but I have to believe it based off of the own many resurrections these pre resurrections that I've seen in my own life everything from from having a sickness or having a having something happen that would just unsalvageable being resurrected it got me thinking that that maybe maybe it could just be possible in in little little miniature I guess pageau called a fractal I mean normal people call a fractal here but it looks to be that way but then when I open up literature when I read about when I read about you know Dante's ascent out of hell into purgatory up into heaven it's just one great sort of one great resurrection that's happened a million times before I mean it's it's all over the place I read about it in the letters of Van Gogh where he's talking about the use of beautific colors that that that reveal the and that that everything that he has everything that he sees he sees it best through the dirt underneath the fingernails of the people that are closest to the earth because he sees the vanity in this in this dirty unkept nature this messy nature of humanity a little bit what you're alluding to before about about this this this friction that happens between one side another the the energy and the friction and the beauty is it all happens the same place and so and so it's that it's that energy there that I think is what will lead up to the momentum of the eventual resurrection that Christ is using that to to have himself be proclaimed over on you see this not only the you know in the in the work of the beauty the Buddha but you also see this in the Vedic traditions you see this in philosophy you read about this although he's incorrect his assessment in Joseph Campbell about the miss you see this over and over and over again and I can't help but believe that it must be true not because of all the evidence because if if all the all the incorrect injustices that I've seen with my own eyes are not reverted and then only reverted but they're not reverted made untrue and then I see for my own eyes that they're made untrue my eyes cannot see justice let alone the people that see justice and so both those things happen to have to happen and so therefore I believe that with my own eyes I shall see the resurrection resurrected Christ and I see all of all the remainder come up with him I mean it's it's it's unstoppable it's logically necessary it's mathematically necessary and it's necessary based off of every other parameter parameter that I can think of your answers a lot like Jonathan Peugeot's answer it's a good answer I forget where I heard Jonathan say that it might have been on the sacred podcast all right McMosa here you go have you ever had to fire someone and how do you fire someone like Christ boy that's a that's a that's an interesting question I and I know you've had to fire people especially given the kind of work you've done I'm sure I'm sure you've had to fire a lot of people what will talk to me about what it's like for a Christian to fire someone it's important to tell them the truth that if someone is in the is in a wrong place in their life that they're not succeeding you've given them chances that they're obviously doing the wrong thing and I would be a bad Christian and they would be a bad steward of their times to remain in that in that position I could it would be better to be out there wondering wondering around trying to find the right thing for them to do with their luck with their lives and for me to allow that this to persist and to pervade and for them to be just wanting in their very life and so I have a duty as a boss to make sure that you are in the place where God wants you to be whether you believe in him or not and you have a you have a duty to do what's right and to do what you you were created for whether you believe that or not all right so I'm so what appeals to you about this little corner of the internet and if you don't have time for TV what value do you get out of listening to people like me and others in this little corner I like to think about the synthesization of various domains that's really what I like not necessarily the domains not less necessary literature and art and history and world religions I like to think about the glue that binds them how are these connected these sorts of these sorts of things and so when I hear Paul talk about what Vervecky said on another podcast or if I you know like I heard you speak a little bit with with Martin the other day you know I really enjoy hearing this Christianization of the mythos and then also what what you guys are seeing people like like Paul and then also with you know with the other other Brits like if I can say that that have pivoted over to to this this this side but I like the little the the nichey miss of the analysis because it's it's it's it's more entertaining to me it's more intellectually stimulating and I'm someone that that believes my in my intellect should be subservient to my imagination and so that's why I like being here very cool very cool all right we got a business question what is the most important part for a business plan towards alone and I have no understanding of this question at all so because I am NOT a business guy but maybe you understand it doesn't make sense my screen is inverted so I can't read it okay what is the most important part of a business plan towards a loan investment pitch I don't understand the question yeah yeah so you you need to prove three things you need to prove that you've got competency you need to prove that you've got integrity and then you also have to prove that you've got the discipline to pull it off and you can prove those three things you have a chance you really have a chance but the integrity is number one the company's number two and the discipline is number three number three and if you if you find yourself in a business situation that that you you're able to display those year after year after year people know you for that people will throw money at you okay how do you feel about the about the trend of deconstruction now I assume he's talking about people leaving the faith and people leaving church and people walking away from church and in America you know because that had already happened in Europe but it's we're seeing a big wave of it in America right now what are your thoughts on that yeah I believe it was Billy Graham that was asked a number of years ago about what percentage of people that attend church on Sundays are actually Christians and the number he threw out was something like 85% are not Christians that was never he threw out and I may be wrong on that but that's just seems to remember from years ago and so this that number was striking to me that maybe it would be better for these people not to be in church and realize the depth of their gravity and where they're missing the mark then to be in church and think that they that their social standing as a truce goer is will somehow somehow sanctify them in the end and so I personally would rather these people not be in a church context I'd rather than be away from the gospel because you have to know that you're lost and if you're gonna if you're ever gonna pivot towards the light you've got you've got to know your loss first no one that thinks that they're that they're already found that they're going in the right direction is gonna pivot do you have a group of men and women at your church that you kick around these kinds of topics together not at my church we do have a group of guys that are very very high achievers all very well read and we have a Junto group for those of you not familiar with the Junto Benjamin Franklin had a Junto group for a number of years and these were basically the savviest men that he could find and they would get they would get together for all night talking sessions for our group we get together at one of their ranches generally about every 60 days and we speak we talk about topics generally someone to pass out up or send out a an article to discuss Chesterton something like that and we'll discuss it we'll discuss all sorts of other things late into the evening we'll all go to sleep we'll get up in the morning we'll have breakfast together and then go to work the next day that's the closest thing that I have I have in the world to that but it's not not a connection to the church have you have you heard anything about my estuary project I don't know if you've encountered that in the channel what a lot of people struggle with especially in the corner actually I'm talking to John Van Donk after I after this conversation because I'm gonna address this directly because people it's there's a weird dynamic when you watch someone on YouTube you think you know that person and to a degree you do but especially at some channel that puts out as much as I put out most people a few can but most people can in no way watch everything I put out and so the algorithm actually only I mean I watched the algorithm quite carefully and I notice that it's very selective because sometimes I'll run across certain videos and then I'll decide okay I'm gonna dig down further and I discover there's whole ranges of videos from a channel that the algorithm doesn't show me it only shows me the certain videos that align up with sort of the little group that the algorithm thinks I'm part of a cohort with and people don't understand really how that works so so part of what I've been working on is John Van Damme will be very happy to hear me say this part of what I've been working on is this estuary project and I we are we are now doing it at 9 a.m. on Sunday mornings because I think actually it's very helpful churches get very insular very quickly and if I think probably more in the Bible Belt a lot of the stuff going on in the broader conversation is sort of echoed in the churches but in a place like California a lot of the stuff going on in the broader conversation is post-Christian and it's sometimes anti-Christian so that there becomes then a real dislocation between the church and the culture now there's an advantage to that that's sort of a natural process by which the church sort of cocoons itself and preserves itself in a in a hostile environment but there's a downside to that which is that the church loses the capacity to actually and the members of the church lose the capacity to actually be able to productively engage in what's actually going on in their culture and so estuary is sort of a way it's just sort of a simple conversational it's sort of a simple conversational project by which right now we've got people from our estuary group who don't go to church at all and have never been to church at all know nothing about church and they're sitting down with people who have gone to church for decades and they're actually being able to have a conversation together and what they're discovering is that oh you have some things that I'd like to learn more about and you'd have some things that I and so last Sunday we had our second 9 a.m. estuary meeting and so it's so funny because in my church I have a lot of senior citizen African-American women who have these amazing stories about the Jim Crow South and growing up there or stories about what it's like to be poor and black in America and you've got much more of these YouTube people who tend to be white doing well in business and they're having these conversations with these women from the south and it's just so much fun to watch and so yeah so if you want to know if you if you want to know more about estuary just go to estuary estuary hub org and and or just go Paul Vanderkley estuary and you can find out because I think that's a really critical thing going on in churches that especially in a place where churches are sort of living in a negative world church people need to know how to live not just within their little cocoon but outside in the in the in the big ocean yeah yeah and I think that's a lot of the reason why I I still have a foot in business as well as trying to do all these other things that I'm trying to do is because I can get my foot in doors that I couldn't get in if I wasn't in business right it's it's it's the platform that allows me interest to certain rooms and if I didn't have that I would be very much hamstrung so so one of the things I like to do is I like to figure out and I'm working with people from all over the world a lot of Indians a lot of people from from Asia not trying out I don't do business people in China North Korea anything like that but Japanese South Koreans those sorts of things and and we we have really interesting conversations about what their faith is but if I can learn a little bit about their faith and I can learn about so so for instance you've got this idea of you know Krishna Lord Krishna says that I am I am people tree I am papal tree I'm a fig tree and and that you know my my branches are Lord Lord Shiva the destroyer my my trunk is is Vishnu and my roots is Brahma and and collectively I am the tree and he's like I said so you're telling me he's a Trinity right that's what you just say you just said he's a Trinity well yeah but it's not it's not really the same because you know we don't believe three or three isn't absolutely three I said so it's one it's here's three is one it's not definitely not to like what it what is it and so I'm able to tease him a little bit like that and I and you know I could bring up a story you know there was a there was a story about this about this Jewish guy I'm not a Jew but there's this Jewish guy's walking into Jerusalem he's hungry he looks over and he sees these leaves these these Shiva leaves these this destroyer leaves that he's that on his fig tree should be grown in season and he goes over to pick some fruit there's no fruit on it and what does he do he curses it with the word and what he does he destroys the triune Krishna the triune Vedic God not with an axe for the very word and and and so I you know in 60 seconds I can give them a story of the gospel but a start where they're at and that is one of the most enjoyable satisfying things ever that if you can poke the bear you sometimes you can get them to give you a little feedback or sometimes they'll invite their their priest into the conversation which I love that's fantastic you know you can't you can't be in a better situation as someone that's trained to share the gospel yeah all right question from Luke how difficult is it for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven asking for me and most affluent people which is many of us on this live stream you know you might not feel affluent living in North America but if you look at what people live around the world if you're middle-class North America you are definitely part of the top percentages of people in America so this classic Christian question how to answer this yeah so so the beautiful thing is God gives us all the same resolution he gives us all the same answer that the poor man in order to get more so that he has enough to provide for his family and to end to be generous he must be generous he must give give stuff away he must give his money away in fact Lewis would say that the only safe amount to give is more than you can afford but for the wealthy man his solution to fight his own greed which is the which is the damnation this is what this is what Christ talks about in the Gospels he talks about giving away it's not how much it's not what you give away it's how much you keep like you shouldn't really keep it keep anything that that the solution for the for the rich man is generosity as well that you should give that away because if you give it away you don't value as much and you slowly move your heart away for it let me let me let me throw one other scriptural things as we're on a we're on a Christian podcast here I don't do a lot of Christian podcasts so this is this is fun the there's command in the New Testament that says love your neighbor as yourself that also has a mathematical equivalent that I should spend as much on myself as I do on others and only that much which means I should be given away half my income for others right love is you know you can you can show it based off your calendar or your pocketbook there's not a whole lot of the ways to do that I that's true all right Pseudo-Boeithius wants to know what does he think about the future of America we have a we have a serious birthrate problem we need it we need to get our get our hands around we're very very soon maybe in 50 years gonna find ourselves in the in the situation of South Korea that's a that's a risk the bigger risk I believe now I served on a on a Middle Eastern Jewish board I'm someone that had a Fathwa against me for a time for another another organization I served in so I'm very very sensitive to this but the the Muslim birth rates are very very high I think the last time I looked maybe a decade ago they were they were an excess of eight and that's their strategy they're gonna just gonna flood the market with Muslims and if you look up in the Sahara region of Africa what you'll see is you'll see this battle going back and forth so they're they're called to build a mosque every I think it was like every five miles they got to be every three miles it was something crazy like that and so you'll see this battle for missionary organizations going and then they're in converting these these little disparate tribal regions and they'll convert them the mosque will come a church and the there's all there's there's this back and forth there you will begin to see that here in America and you won't have a problem with right and left or or genders or anything like that you have a problem with the the Antichrist manifest as the mock tea coming in here trying to put shoes it puts you and your Christ's under their subservience that's gonna be your big problem Michael Satori asks have you considered integrating an apprentice program into your businesses as a means of discipleship yes so we have run scenarios where we would spend a year with young people that are generally just maybe just came out of school with their MBA and so I'll meet with them generally once a month and we'll talk about high conceptual things so so I'll break down for instance the Dow forum and show and teach about yin and yang and how all that kind of cascades down into into reality without a Christian bent but I think you can get there very very closely very very very shortly from there but but I do do that I I would be very interested in trying to figure out a way to scale that so you know if anyone has any ideas about how to scale something like that on YouTube or some other parameter you know I'm all ears because I think that would be a very very good leverage point well Michael Michael lives in New England and he's you can you can come back and you can get his name here and then you can find his YouTube channel he he he noted that a lot of a lot of young men I mean part of what part of the problem we have in our culture I think actually right now is we have we have too much of a we have sort of a fetish about higher education and so we think unless someone is going to college you know they don't have a future and the truth especially for a lot of men more than women men often just in terms of our disposition we like to work with our hands we like to work with real things and he noted that in churches that tended to have a lot of older people you could find a lot of older men with a lot of skills skills in woodworking machining landscaping a lot of fill skills in the physical world and and there are a lot of men growing up especially in the meaning crisis space that aren't that that don't have these skills they don't they might not have fathers that are passing them down to them they might not have any of this thing going on and so he said why don't we why don't we teach some of these men these skills by using often some of these retired older men to teach the younger men and and so Michael has a as a and he's integrated this in terms of Christian discipleship as well which I thought is a is really a cool idea and so if you're curious about this you can check out Michael's channel or contact him I'm sure he'd love to talk to you about it so yeah I'll definitely check that out I because I think that problem even continues up in the men or 50s and 60s because I think you've got a lot of men that have graduated school they've gone and sat behind the same desk for 20 years 30 years and so you have 60 year old boys in essence working there have never taken a risk never done anything never given up their time or their money or their assets never really cared about anything other than selves and their their little cohesive family of four and that's a big that's a big challenge as well and so I think there there are men that God is gonna put in place that will that will attack each generation there and and provide the information provide the encouragement that they that they need but but there you got to fix the why before you can fix the how and what all right do you ever feel guilty for your high levels of competence and success compared to the majority of others sometimes it feels like worldly successes and Christian teachings are at odds that again this is a long question yeah one more time more time okay do you ever feel guilty for your high levels of competence and success compared to the majority of others sometimes it feels like worldly successes and Christian teaching are at odds yeah so it's do I do I feel guilty I do not feel guilty because while most people were sleeping this morning I was already at the office working I I don't I don't feel guilty for that I don't feel guilty for that I don't feel guilty that for the first 25 years of me running this business that I worked 16 hour days and while everyone else worked eight hour days you shouldn't feel guilty because mathematically you gained 25 years experience but I gained 50 years of experience I made more mistakes but I I was humble enough to see what the mistakes were learn from mistakes and repeat and my repetitive cycle my feedback loops that got faster and faster and faster and so I'm sitting here basically a 45 year old with 50 years of experience compared to everyone else I don't feel guilty for that it's pure math that anyone else can do Chad wants to know what do you do for fun man I'm doing volleyball tournaments I'm going to basketball third middle school girls basketball is the best sport in America those girls will find it out they'll duke it out it's it's it's fantastic then I've got a pre-professional ballerina as well so man we're going to lessons like you know five nights a week I'm getting you know my last pick up most nights is 930 so I'm picking up my daughter from ballet 930 then trying to get home and feed her feed her again and trying to get to bed by 10 10 30 that that keeps me pretty busy yeah yeah all right are you the best in the world at what you do absolutely not I'm horrible no I you know I'm not even a good Christian I'm not even a good Christian I don't think there's anything that I can be the best in the world at I know that you kind of look at those concentric venn diagram things on YouTube that that say you should find out which are the best in the world at I may be the best in the world at at realizing that I really know nothing that that's that's really what I could be the best in world of not not knowing not knowing what I don't know but realizing that there's there's a lot of things that I don't know all right I am going to I'm going to drop the link into the hive mind I'm not seeing a lot of questions so so get ready Rick like I said I decided to do this I decided to do this with you because you didn't seem like someone who was gonna it was gonna back down from and it's been I just watching the hive mind it's been an interesting interesting show and I frankly I hate I don't hate I I I fear cocoons and cocoons develop in lots of different ways and cocoons have their have their role but when people is this is probably why I'm so high in openness when people decide they're going to just take a certain thing and say I'm I'm not gonna be and everybody has a right to to have their own opinion but I like I like I'm really glad you came on I'm really glad you're willing to do this well you volunteered so I yeah yeah yeah well I am I'm a frustrated individual to my wife I think I mentioned one of the emails I've done some some atheist debates you could probably find online I am frustrating to them because they want to talk about technical technicalities in the scripture and I'm trying to give context and I'm trying to tell stories around it and it's just a frustrating thing yeah well here's here's the guy Michael tell us tell us about tell us about you asked the apprenticeship question which I thought was a great question and I tried to give some fair assessment of your of your ministry so maybe you can shed that or you maybe have another question yeah no well I so I am I'm in Texas by Rick I'm not I'm not living and I grew up in New England but I've been in I've been in now so yeah well yeah so I I work full-time for a cabinet company and I'm also a youth pastor and you know my story was that I my dad was a pastor and he got saved in the 70s and all he cared about was that his kids knew Jesus which unfortunately meant that he didn't really prepare me for how to how to make a living too well and I kind of fell fell fell backwards into a trade career through some opportunities that I got and you know ultimately came to realize that you know working with your hands is a very spiritual spiritually beneficial process and and it's you know while I'm listening to Paul every morning I'm you know working on cabinets and things and so so I'm trying to I'm trying to figure out ways to produce resources for people who work in trades you might be able to bring somebody on and show them the ropes and you know because like 60% of guys aren't even going to college these days and but they're not there some of them are getting into the trades most of them are staying in their parents basement playing video games so so yeah that's kind of my my thing but you know I have the the vision I don't have the business acumen to figure all of it out but but I'm you know trying to reach out and get in touch with other people because people seem to be receptive to the idea and like you I also have three daughters so that's my concern for the future is who who are these young men and where are they going to come from so that's that's my deal so yeah yeah I think I think a lot of it is just realizing you come up you come from a line of men that work with their hands as they taught right yeah one of the one of the things I put in the email to Paul was that I'm just a tent maker you know I might I might have a I might have a title that people like to have but I'm just a tent maker I work with my hands but mainly with my fingers but I I worked my hands and and and if I can help people along as I'm doing that I think that's I think it's fantastic but I think that you're you know your your strategy to be able to add value in a in a very very tangible act activity is what will open up the opportunity to share more than someone coming off the street or someone on a YouTube channel right you know you can be in person and you can add you can add that value in a way that no one else can do and I think that's it I think it's a beautiful thing because you're actually using your you're trading your time for influence most most of the people that you see online are not trading time for influence Paul excluded they're trading influence for power is what they're trying to do and so and so you you're doing something that that seems to be more holy in nature and that you're right and that you know if you if you can get this to propagate in some way shape or form where you can you can encourage other people to to share what you teach them I think that's where the gold's really gonna be in it you know we used to plant churches we planted over 15,000 churches at one of the organizations I was in charge of you never plant a church unless it's a pregnant church already like you you've got to have the next generation already birth in the in the actual birthing it is you've got to have repetition and skill there because that's how you that's how you get leverage I love what you're doing Michael that that is awesome yeah feel free to reach out if you know if I can be of assistance on anything great Steve the golfer all right Steve what do you have to say for yourself well I like so I I was watching another stream so I missed the very beginning and it wasn't really clear to me it was almost like we were listening to AM radio so it was like what are we listening to it's like AM Blue Church radio or something so I'm Blue Church this is this is he's the least Blue Church guy I've ever had on my channel at least overtly so he had he had Donald J Trump jr. I don't know Donald Trump jr. middle initial but come on this is this is this is stretching y'all and open this on a new liquid show because nobody's more open than Luke I mean open I'm just I'm I wasn't sure like like I was saying in the chat like this is watching this particular episode is kind of like I felt like how my wife feels when she watches PBK I was just curious like what so what is the what were you what were you hoping to do with the show like I like I wasn't sure what we were what the it wasn't a typical randos format it didn't seem like no it did I mean I spent the first really hour getting into a story oh so I'm the idiot son oh you're not an idiot Chad I'm sorry oh by the way what's your name Rick hey I was just I didn't want to be rude to you with the questions I was just curious about you know like who is this dude and so I wasn't trying to be rude just asking some questions testing you a little bit yeah I appreciate that yeah and that's all I want to say I'm actually Chad it's all stupid so why did you want to come on Rick Steve why did you want to come on Rick well I thought it'd be great to meet you Paul I thought it'd be great to have a conversation with everyone that's watching you got you've got some very interesting people watching I've got I've got a handful of guys that are wearing suits all day there that are that are a little more little more button down here but yeah I thought it'd be great and just just frankly for the for the tactical nature of it you know I am working on a book that you're writing six or seven months so I'm just trying to get out there a little bit more okay okay yeah all right all right Luke what do you have to say it's it's Luke was the one Luke you've Luke's I love Luke's you know so so Grizz I always tune into Grizz but lately Luke you know he's got these early morning live streams that I've really been enjoying can't always catch so well what do you what what do you have to say Luke so thank you I so I I'm excited to go back and hear the intro where I hear more of the details specifics and the rando stuff but I just caught the tail end because I just didn't see it until right now and and I wanted to say two things first off I appreciate you coming in here because truly the I've been talking about on my live streams that a lot of what happens in this little corner the internet and particularly the PVK corner the internet is is almost like oh I see it almost as like a remedy for a lot of mainstream Christian culture which is what a lot of us are somewhat outcasts or like in recovery from a little bit and so and and I still have family that's still very much in that and I'm still like I'm Orthodox so I'm going to like an established church but it's a it's a weird it's a weird world to put yourself into like I mean I would almost say that like the kind of southern Baptist evangelical type people although I know a lot of those and a lot of those are my friends they're almost like that culture is almost like the opposite kind of culture of this culture and so I really appreciate you coming in here and and just stepping into the Hornet's Nest a little bit and then the other thing is Taiyo was saying in the in the chat a lot that and he was observing this I think it's very true there can almost be like a like a bodily antibody reaction to to someone like you coming in here and that's a little bit bullshit I think like I mean I want people like you in here in a very personal relational way and so I just thank you for doing that and putting yourself out there because it takes some courage balls maybe you could say yeah yeah no I really do appreciate that Luke it seems to me that that us guys who do where suits most days that that we that there are certain areas I wouldn't call them corners but necessary but there's certain areas where we feel a little bit less welcome sometimes and I think that you know if we if we were to have a full two-hour theological conversation you will see how much of a mystic I really am like I'm gonna I'm gonna out mystic all of you you already won it's gonna be so it's gonna be so insane and and but some of us have bills to pay some of us have very expensive wives some of us have made commitments to nonprofit organizations that we can't fulfill unless we keep we keep working and so thus the suit comes on and this is what you get sometimes but yeah now I really appreciate that that was awesome here great thank you Luke Grimm Grizz all right all right Grimm is skeptical Grimm is like I don't know can can can a guy doesn't guy like this really watch let's find out pastor Paul let's find out what is obvious to me is that everybody who has participated in this in this stream needs a savings throw versus mind control everybody who watches me should knows how those work so um choose Rick choose so I guess my control I'm doing a savings throw versus mine control watch me no they get a choice when I do a savings throw versus mind control and so clearly you knew you know to choose one of the choices I always present choose Grizz you don't and I'm totally with Luke in this you know this is let me tell let me tell you what happened with my Jordan Peterson meetup we had the Jordan Peterson meetup it was going for a number of years and then we had kovat and so you know we had to quote sort of you know okay I don't want you know the old anyway and then a bunch of people are like we like our meetup we just don't want new people and when I heard that I said no I'm not I'm not putting up barriers I'm not putting up barriers I heard a story on a live stream yesterday and in your description of this live stream the only reason this happened was because of my name drop and as he also dropped Matthew Peugeot too yeah well well that's not what it said in the description and and and and verveky and verveky yeah and I never I never I never said we were best friends I said like I yes name of people in the corner is what is I think what Paul's challenge was it was good yeah I was a tactical move and it was genius Rick I'll give you that but that's exactly why the savings throw versus the mind control and everybody who knows make your choice those of you who chose survival it's a 12 those of you who chose social it's an 18 those of you who chose wisdom Bakers Coven 13 and those of you who chose heart 7 you're gonna need your bonuses in the go kids with the 15 and thank you Paul I'm always I'm always a heart now hang on Chris I got a question for you about the savings throws are the savings throws good per live stream or per day because you know I caught the savings throws this morning and well if you catch them you can use them until the next batch sometimes I go days without live streams and you're still running on the old ones all right all right thank you Grizz thank you Grizz anything else Chad you want to you want to bring in I don't know well let me ask you Rick do you have any questions for us because I mean I I know just like I said groups get insular and then they have their rituals and then if you go to church and it was just actually I know this because people go into a church and especially if the church is thick their stand-up sit down there say these words there's do these things and even if they're a low church there's all these little tests to say are you one of us and at one level that's a really healthy thing because groups have to know what you know who's who's who in the group but these things also can become something that are very exclusive and it's like you'll never be one of us because you don't have this and so that's that's part of the reason why I am so glad you're here because Grimm Grizz is Grimm Grizz is thing this morning was was this little cave and I was gonna make a video about that and because I'm you know that's that's part of what I'm concerned about I don't want this little corner or this little clearing to become this little cave so doesn't exist don't worry you came back on Michael well yes so since you were saying that they did think of a question for Rick is you know what do you because this is a little bit my other the other half of my project what do you think the normal evangelical world needs from this corner and you know these conversations with people like Paul and the others associated Pete and I Pete and I had a talk and it's releasing on my channel right after this is a great time oh great I check that out yeah I think it would be helpful to know what some of you more outspoken guys are reading what you're watching I think that would be very helpful so so like for for me let me let me just let me just use JBP for example I'm listening to this guy and all he's doing is talking about you know five years ago he's talking about Jung and he's talking about Joseph Campbell but he never says Joseph Campbell it's over and over and over again I just tell me you're reciting Joseph Campbell just tell me that you're blaming Christianity you can never accept Christianity because there was miss that came beforehand like just tell me that just tell me that and that's what I'd like to hear from you know not only this corner but also other corners like what are the inputs what are the inputs you know I I'm spending time going back in you know I'm you know mentioned Dante early I'm reading Dostoevsky I'm reading I'm reading poetry I'm looking I'm you know visiting art museums to try to figure out what did Rembrandt mean by this or that and I'm reading you know myths and I'm reading the actual source text but then I get on YouTube I hear people that are that are reciting stuff that they they learned on YouTube videos and there's no source documentation on that and so I would like to find out what the hell's going on like where are people learning this stuff I must be missing stuff if you go over to the Friday morning nameless I often will mention all of the different literature that I'm reading or or films I'm quoting from so yeah I think there's a there's a lot of that I mean grail country is great for that you know okay would you link to that in the comments? It's got to be better about putting in your putting in your links in the notes I work very hard to make sure all my links get in the notes because I'll often watch something on one of the other channels and they'll mention something and they haven't put it in the notes and I think that's you know Grizz has sort of been good at sort of forming people in certain ways with his branding and teaching us some things but one of the things I'd admonish a lot of the smaller channels is when you when you have something in your live stream put it in your notes so that other people can follow up because what you just said right now Rick is super important because that's how I use YouTube too I hear a little something and it's like okay now I want to dig into that because there's probably more gold where that little bit of gold was found yeah we don't want to be like normie Christian YouTube where they don't link to anybody else's channel this is a conglomerate you got to follow the white rabbit you know where it leads and that's you know that's part of it that it's like the appendix of a book you know so we got navigating patterns mentioned Michael what's the name of your channel so Michael mine is my name for the one where I say all the crazy stuff but tectonic school is my one where I try to focus on the trade the apprentice apprenticeship thing so and Pete you've got I'm a strange theology is my sort of like a podcast style YouTube channel I look at theology when it pops up in strange places I like that so so okay Pete so you jumped in what would you like okay okay this actually goes to something that Chad posted not too long ago sorry Steve and it was it was a clip it's a clip from Jonathan Bejoe talking about the fringes of the garments of the priest and the fringes of the field and I think Paul like what you're doing right now is great like Rick I don't know you from the next guy on the street never seen you before show up on Paul Vanderklaas channel I know I've watched Paul's channel stuff like that and and what it is is it's as your field grows the the fringes the edge of that field that people can glean is it's like it's less accessible I'm not a mathematician so maybe somebody can help me out with this idea but it seems like the ratio to edge and area gets out of balance the bigger you get and so I think there's something that has to happen to break up that field or to still allow people to access sort of the fringe of the field while not being dislocated from what the thing is in the center am I making any sense because like that's that's what I feel about like this little corner the phenomenon that's going on even Paul's channel other channels that are bigger it's like you're not gonna how do I reach what's in in that field and I want to glean from the edges I want to still be let in around the edges but the the bigger you get the more dislocated the edges from the core if that makes sense and so Paul what you're doing right now with Rick it's like it's something to do with that I don't know where it came from you know Rick knows Rick's story but but here you are you're you're in a way disrupting the imbalance hope and in a way hopey hoping to bring us back into some sort of balance to say yeah it's a little weird to to see unfamiliar faces or hear unfamiliar voices and I want to embrace that weirdness I want to embrace the challenge of a new voice I don't want the field to just get big and filled with all the same stuff because that's that I think Luke was saying earlier we want to be the antidote to that type of behavior that was my thought well and I think I think part of what like the banser was part of the welcoming party you know and they I think that's that's kind of a normal thing but yeah I don't really know what your question was but no it's not a question I just wanted to I just wanted to point that out I feel like I feel like what Paul is doing in a way is is somehow and I don't fully understand it but it's somehow preventing the edge of the field from being dislocated from what the center of the field is like and I think I understand completely what you're saying Pete or I think I under I think I very much understand what you're saying and I very much feel those dynamics yeah because this is also part of the reason why you know I'm stressed right now to find enough time during the month to get everything but why I've continued to have you know non membership randos links out there and I know it's almost impossible sometimes to get a link but this is why I want to have input into my channel that I don't control and it's it's very much tied with what I learned from Peugeot with respect to the garments on that the fringe on the garment or the edges of the field unless you keep enough openness in your system to allow something different from what you've had that field is actually going to have a problem it's for the health of the field that it has a fringe yep and you have to sometimes bring this in to to you know it's sort of what was I and I have no idea if this makes any sense physiologically but it's sort of the idea behind you know this this little fasting trend that's going on in health things I or it's it's similar if you're dieting so one of the things if you want to lose weight and every now and then it's like yeah I gotta gain I gotta start losing weight is you start dieting and every now and then you kind of kind of have to do something dramatic because your body has sort of accustomed itself to the new diet and you stop losing weight so you have to do something to shock it again so that you can keep going where you want to go and and I've seen that in churches and that's why if if you don't really bother your church sometimes if you don't really cause people in that church to say wait a minute do I really belong here you need to incorporate that in your system to actually keep the system healthy well and to keep to your farming a metaphor there and when you farmers will have to rotate their crops in their fields otherwise your fields will die and if you have a mono crop that mono crop becomes susceptible to disease yeah it just gets wiped out you want that diversity to prevent a catastrophic failure of your of your crop yep yep look at chaos and order as David Boyer said it's you get too much order and you know and I've been going through the Gospel of Mark in my rough drafts and that you know it's just like just like you said Rick you know I don't mind I don't mind I don't mind him dropping an f-bomb in the stream if it if that's how he uses it because he's right because if you're really reading the beginning of the Gospel of Mark I mean I love Matthew and I love Luke but they're different the beginning of the Gospel of Mark just breathes from someone probably Peter who watched it happen who had his life termed upside down by this Jesus and even though Matthew and Luke probably take from Mark what is preserved in Mark is this sense that Jesus was doing this stuff and nobody but nobody knew what to think of him his own family got to a point of saying we we better step in because what has happened to our nice Jewish boy and and if you lose this if you lose this if you lose this you lose something of the gospel because unless Jesus can completely turn your life upside down it's probably not Jesus yeah yeah I mean I think I think exactly what you said you look at the you look at the opening to Mark chapter 2 Jesus is at home in Capernaum the house is packed and they're trying to get a paralytic in there so they're sort of ripping off the the roof of Jesus' own home which probably had mud and all sorts of thing they let him in and what happens he changes everything he says he see the Bible says it sees the faith of the four men that let him in and then he imputes forgiveness on the cripple based off the the other four men's faith that's insanity that is complete and utter insanity and then the scribes that are sitting there he reads their minds he reads their damn minds for my trust probably wasn't real hard because he knew exactly what they're thinking no they're thinking of himself this is this is blasphemy and he saw showing blasphemy what's harder for me to either say your sins are forgiven or say get up and take your mat and go home he came as him take his bag go with the guy leaves and then it's so what we're left at we're left with Jesus standing face to face with the chief with the with the scribes with a hole in his roof and the mud so you've got the vertical connection they're looking up through the ceiling at the sky the heavens declare the glory of God looking down at their feet at the very mud that that the same breather who is the same word is saying right there who breathe in the mud and gave them light that's their very being and then horizontally he tells you that you've got to forgive one another and you come to me for forgiveness only he wipes the floor with everything vertically and horizontally in Mark chapter 2 and then the rest of the stuff is just a free for all yeah yeah no I agree I agree a hundred percent and if you know both both side I mean and Pete I think you really nailed it with what you're talking about in terms of the field I mean God comes into Israel and everybody thinks they know what God is going to do and as soon as you adopt that attitude you have basically said I've mapped God yep and the minute you think you've mapped God yeah so I always say be be careful of anybody who claims to be an expert in theology because because the the journey of theology should keep you very humble and like it's gonna surprise you like you're never gonna have this figured out all right well it's it's noon and and I've got a I've got a 1 p.m. with Vin Donk and I've got a rough draft and I've got all these things I've got to do but Rick I just want to thank you for for being bold and for shaking up my little email inbox and talking your way onto the live stream and being willing to come in here and and that's the thing I I I hesitate to do Randall's conversations on a live stream because the live stream can be a little rough but when I got your email I thought no this guy this guy can take it and I'm so glad that you came in hey this is this has been a blast Paul I really appreciate you
