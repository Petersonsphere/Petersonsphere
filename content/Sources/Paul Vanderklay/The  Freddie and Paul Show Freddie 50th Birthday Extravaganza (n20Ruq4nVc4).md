Like on the Freddie and Paul show. Good to go. Don't you know? Like solid gold. Like shimmering tight. I come up bright like vanilla ice. Yo, that's right. Boy, Charles J. Bustin' something. Because you're always up to something. Once upon a time there was a man named CJ. He'd bust the first raps every day. As he cruised down the street, in his lexicon his name was known from college to Texas. All girls want to know his name. Like dice, he played them all the same. Dressed to impress, always was he. And girls mighted bite his hand to share the love. Follow him like a fan like Vegas. There's no luck twice to shine bright. Like double O-70, turn up all the lights. His curls shine for all the freaks. Drooping down past shoulders. Look at his chic, wearing a lace cologne. Smelling nice, wearing diamonds and chains. Shimmering tight. That's right. Tight, you see? Yo, E-40 is cool, you know? All the way to the top. Don't forget about two short keys. Good to go. Got to work the same. Ice cube nose. Then you got Snoop Dogg, you dog. He is trained and he ain't odd. Peace out to Snoop. Peace out to Dre. Don't forget about Eminem, really though, okay? Then you got, my boy, MC Hammer. Doing it right. Like he said, we got to pray just to make it today. That's right, we got to do it right. We got to keep it game tight every single, single day. Rocking on the microphone like I was to the place with the rhythm to the top. Rhythm to the bottom. Oh! I think that got him. Nice. Who's that guy? He's Freddie. He loves Jesus Christ, Gene. Who's that guy? He's Freddie. He loves Jesus Christ, Gene. You ended off, Charles J, with a rap. That is so funky and that's a fact. So let me hear you, Charles J, one more verse and don't you dare start to curse. When I drive down the street in my 65 all the ladies roll by and say hi. I get plenty of numbers, you know, the seven digits with the ladies I met and you might say I'm with Barbara, Diane, and girl named Susan. You know I'm the greatest cash-to-stuck lady cause my foot hits the pedal and she's in the gear, Veronica. Follow me from the rear, I pull over and start to curse. She comes to every work, my game is dead. She's staying behind in my time. Wherever in mine. Did you guys know? Ganton Morgan, who does that, Charles J's channel, on YouTube as well. Real tight. That was awesome. That was awesome. Alright, let's finish this show off talking what's going to happen for the rest of the week on sports. Okay, so today we got the 49ers and the Cowboys. Let's hope Prescott doesn't have a good game. And let's hope Holmes doesn't have a good game if it's the 49ers against the Chiefs. And we need the Kings to continue to do good and stay healthy and have their coaches come game tight and all that stuff. Peace out to Forrest, peace out to Gordon. We didn't see you today but that's okay. He must be busy, he's okay. And um, yeah, so let's just keep it real. Let's do this right. Just keep peace and harmony in the world because if we have more peace and harmony the world will be a better world. Because we got to pray just to make it today. That's why we pray. So anyways, I hope this is good for you and I'm having a good birthday and I feel right and I got it going on and that's tight. So, amen, hallelujah. Thank you Charles J.

Basically, so give me some ideas what I can do for the show in the future. Oh, we'll just keep making stuff up. We'll keep making stuff up. We can do this all the time now? I don't think we're... I don't think we're... Maybe once a month? We'll do this again sometime. We can't do it every time. I know, once a month. Because I remember it's 25 minutes. We never go 25 minutes. Can we do five more minutes? We said 30 minutes. I want to hear from you Paul. What do you want to hear from me? I just want to hear how I can tune in to your program. You can tune in to my program on YouTube. Paul VanderClay. No, I know that. But I wanted to thank you for putting out three things to tell people. Oh, you're welcome.

What do you think of the Warriors, Paul? What do I think of the Warriors? I don't think about them hardly at all. I'm really happy for the Kings, though. I'm really happy for the Kings.

What size shirt do you wear, Freddie? 2X. 2X shirt. You can send it to Paul. How does it feel to be awesome, Fred? Awesome is awesome like Tossin'. I don't know. Kind of like applesauce. People have been bothering me to do merch. I don't like doing merch just about a week, but we can do merch about the Freddie and Paul show. If there's anybody out there who can do a Pepsi for us. What do we want to advertise Pepsi for? They're not paying us. If Pepsi, if you want us to do a Pepsi commercial, Freddie and I will do a commercial for Pepsi. So we've got to get paid. Okay, we're done. We've got one more. What's one more? One watched American football. Oh, he watched American football in the 80s when Joe Montana, Dan Marial, and Bo Jackson were in action. All right. We have reached the 30 minute mark. I have fulfilled all righteousness. I had a good B day. We've got to pray just to make it today. Okay. Ready? Bye everybody. One love. Amen. Hallelujah.
