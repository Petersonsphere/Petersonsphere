 Hi, this is Paul. I'm gonna do something a little strange again with this video. Last week I made a video about why the same-sex marriage debate is so reactive and I made that as a reaction to some of the comments about my same-sex marriage and the patriarchs video. Now normally when I make a video it's not uncommon for me to feel uneasy about my video. I very seldom look back over them. Usually I feel uneasy about it. I think about the fact that I just spent a couple of hours maybe putting the video together and it's like, ah, throw it out there I'll post it. Every now and then I'll delete one and I delete it so that I can't post it. This one that you're about to see I hung on to and that really demonstrates the amount of internal dissonance I have over this issue. And I held on to it for a week and I thought about deleting it and I never deleted it and I finished up my rough draft. Today is the 17th of April. The rough draft will post Saturday, I usually post my rough drafts lately on Saturday so the 18th that's about Peter. This will post probably on the 20th which will be a Monday. But you know my thinking, on Maundy Thursday, Sam talked with Brett Sockel and I was really inspired by that conversation let's say and so I posted it with a front end and that one's up there with the following thumbnail that you can see on this slide. Confessional Conversations Done Right Transubstantiation and Incarnation and I was very pleased with the response from that video. The confessional conversation idea came to me as I continued to work through what has been a slow simmering in the Christian Reformed Church over same-sex marriage. This is an issue that has splintered mainline denominations. The older churches such as the Orthodox and the Roman Catholic deal with it in interesting different ways. Andrew Sullivan, one of the most outspoken proponents for same-sex marriage, continues to identify in some ways as a Roman Catholic which I find fascinating the way these things work in the Catholic, especially the Catholic churches, fascinates me. But the same-sex, the Christian Reformed Church is sort of a church in the middle. The Reformed Church of America has been just shredded by this issue and the conversation that I did with my friend Andrew, the group of four pastors from British Columbia, bear witness to that where you've got some churches, Reformed Church of America churches in British Columbia considering seriously joining the Christian Reformed Church and my friend Andrew's idea that maybe we can solve this by churches that wish to affirm same-sex marriages heading to the RCA and churches that don't heading to the CRC and then we'll just, that'll settle the issue. I appreciate, I don't know what the future holds. Again, if you listen to my rough draft for Sunday sermon, I bring up the Black Swan and one of the points that Nassim Tlaib keeps making in that book is that the thing we don't learn is that we don't learn and I think that's a really wise and astute observation about human nature. So I don't know what's coming down the road but I, ideas of sort of shutting things out in a Protestant denomination, I don't know if that has ever worked by virtue of the nature of Protestantism. I don't know if it's working for the Roman Catholics and so there's rumors of war visiting your village and for the Christian Reformed Church that is, you know, churches or individuals who want to make a stand and push the issue and I'm under no, I'm under no, it'll come, it'll come. The pandemics, they come. The day of the Lord comes, well what do I mean by that? The day of the Lord is that day when it comes and again watch the rough draft. I know some of you never watch the rough drafts which is okay but there's some stuff in that rough draft sermon you might be interested in because the, what this pandemic is is a disruption of our normal sense-making and meaning-making apparatus to use some of the rebel wisdom nomenclature. It's a disruption and that's what the day of the Lord does and that's why the day of the Lord is apocalypse. It's the end of, you know, when the Roman Empire fell, the seasons continued, much of the earth continued but life changed for certain groups of people because their world changed and if you look at the language of this it's notable and it's telling. So the day of the Lord comes, the day of the Lord comes as a pandemic, the day of the Lord comes as a church fight and people fight when they say, well church fights that caused the destruction of your shire and some of us in the Christian Reformed Church imagine that if the Christian Reformed Church goes to war over this, like it went to war over women in church office, it won't survive. What does that mean it won't survive? Does that mean the churches go away? Well some churches might split, most churches won't but the old order of things changes. Well the order of the Christian Reformed Church potentially changed when the banner went from a weekly to a monthly publication. The Christian Reformed Church has been changing all along and it's only when these events happen that we look back and realize how much has changed. So in a sense the day of the Lord scales. The day of the Lord happens when you lose the job or the doctor says you have cancer or the accident takes your spouse or an admission of betrayal destroys your marriage or your relationship with your father or your mother or your son or your daughter or the day of the Lord scales. It comes to us in tiny bits and sometimes it comes in comes to a whole world as with a COVID-19 pandemic and I'm gonna have a conversation next week with some skeptics about that so that should be fun. But these things come to us and so the confessional conversation about same-sex marriage. Is confessional conversation the right language? That's a hotly debated thing in very small places like CRC Voices. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't the right language but it's the language I'm working with now, maybe it'll change. But the point is sort of made on April 3. I don't always know when I do these things. April 3 I tweeted out I really want to see Ross Douthat and Eric Weinstein together on portal and it broke this week and it was I'm sure it was recorded before I ever sent that tweet so I take no credit for it with that tweet. But I was super happy to see it. I'm only an hour in and Sam said to me oh you're gonna make like three you're gonna want to make like three three videos on this podcast and he might be right. I never know what I'm gonna make videos on because it's very muse-ish what I finally do and don't make videos on and if they get released or deleted. This is this is by no means in case you can't tell by the production quality or by the rambling this is by no means some final finished polished project. My sermons are closer to that but this is this is all work and this is just all process work for me thinking out loud and having someone to think with very much the the mute the spirit at which I approached my blog when I was writing a lot more. But he Eric mentions I haven't dug it up I hope they do a video a YouTube video of it because I can always scan those close captionings fairly easily but you know he brought up that you know things things get polarized and and and communities get stuck on things that the climate change argument is sort of stuck immigration is stuck and and part of Douthat's really astute appropriation of the word decadence for that thing that he's pointing to is is sort of a mass stuckness and that's really what what Douthat is pointing to and of course Eric imagines he can get things unstuck or at least wants to take a shot at it and and and good on him for that you know we all should try to get unstuck but same-sex marriage and the church is stuck and it's painful and someone mentioned Preston Sprinkle I've had a couple of conversations with I should probably message Preston and say let's do a talk about this Preston because the church is stuck and Preston's trying to get it unstuck and confessional conversation I guess is my approach for trying to get it unstuck and and my friend who's running nuance forum he sees lots of stuckness and wants to get things unstuck and and I think I think I think Jordan Peterson really wanted to get things unstuck because and and none of us know what unstuck will look like you know I'm do ever do do things in the age of decay ever get unstuck I don't know I was going to say in some ways the the American Civil Rights Movement led by dr. King got some things unstuck in in terms of segregation and and that was really good but seeing in a sense the new woke religion so often our solutions just seed more problems and that's that's the nature of things in this world for us so so yeah doubt that on the portal awesome awesome can't wait to listen to that two or three times and and if it if it gets sufficiently stuck in my mind there will be videos that come out now I just want to make one other observation about the end of the video that that is about that this a video was about to become you'll notice the different shirts I mean if you can if you want to notice when I make videos and when I post them just watch the clothing because it'll tell you a lot and the haircuts in the shape of the beard and so on and so forth but I sort of tack on to the end of the video a note about what I had said about Peterson in a previous video that had gotten some commentary just today I did a I so the another another miscellaneous comment to explain a different miscellaneous comment I'm a hopeless case this morning I jumped into the discord server bridges of meaning discord server is a server that wasn't started by me it was started by Joey and Tyler and Rick and Job and a bunch of the people in my local meetup and it grew and it's it's become a wonderful thing I hadn't been around for a while my participation had slowly diminished and then the the big trip with job which got cancelled and then the pandemic and beginning of this week I was a little depressed by the whole thing but Job sent me an email and said why don't you jump under the discord server and I've been trying to figure out how to do that so so yesterday I went I did an at everyone which is kind of like shooting a gun in a crowded theater get everybody's attention annoyingly but so then this morning at 10 a.m. I jumped on and we just had a great great time talking on the discord server and voice chat I've thought about doing that once a week and so maybe I'll be able to pull that off I have to figure out how it fits into the rest of my schedule on my very muse like productivity in this space so all of that to say how does that relate to anything that I've said that is probably my enduring problem all of that to say that you know I do listen to feedback and after a video I made where I made a comment about Jordan and I made some comments about Jordan in my conversation with Ron Dart I try to be transparent in my videos because if I'm not transparent at least appropriately so in these videos what are these videos for the greatest thing that has one of many great things have come out of my YouTube channel but but one of the coolest things has been that the channel hasn't gotten so crazy large and that there are many of you when you comment and and you write really substantive comments in YouTube and I don't read them all but I try to read a good number of them and and I learn a ton from your comments I still do two years later and if I had a hundred thousand or a million subscribers I probably wouldn't so praise God for small things and the discord you know the people in the discord some of which I've had conversations with on the channel some of which I haven't had yet just delightful just and just to be able to talk I mean it's one of the when we when we think about the life of the age to come people talk about streets of gold that doesn't impress me you know what I think about I think about never ending conversations one with another and we go further up and further in and we grow together and part of what make these conversations go are differences I was for years involved in two listservs one Calvin and common and the other CRC voices I always enjoyed CRC voices more because there was more diversity and diversity I mean diversity of opinion people and voices fought about stuff they had things they cared about and they and and some of the battles were pitched battles that have gone on for decades but but but they cared enough to talk and they cared enough to share and they cared enough to to fight and and part of what my confessional conversation is about is about learning to fight well if you read marriage therapy books one of the things that you'll see is that a good marriage is not a marriage in which there's there's no conflict and Jordan Peterson hit that dead-on right a good marriage is a marriage in which the conflict is productive and and that's the same in a denomination it's the same in a relationship so when I say things that are not necessarily applauding about Jordan Peterson adults get that that you know plenty of people say things that are not applauding about me we I recently noticed that in the comment section I don't know that he's a bot I don't think he's a bot but there's there's one guy that keeps jumping into the comment section and just a little phrase of you know you did a terrible laugh or horrible video or something like that and I don't know if it's a really tricky bot or if this person is actually just wanting to just be an out-and-out troll and and part of me likes him in there because if nobody if nobody gets upset about what I do then I'm not probably doing it right and Peterson did that so all this to say that at the end of the video that I'm about to play this there's a misordered notice about some stuff about Peterson and it really expresses exactly how I feel about Jordan and again I don't have a personal relationship with him I'm about to read say exactly what I say at the end of it but I deeply appreciate his work and I know a lot of you who I talked to do so too and it doesn't mean that Jordan is perfect by no means it doesn't agree mean I agree with everything that Jordan thinks or says or does I don't you know gosh look at a healthy marriage look at two people who are married for 20-30 years that have all kinds of disagreements and you know to me that's a sign of a healthy marriage because it's two people that can actually share a household and share a roof and and and and recognize that as human beings we are very limited and quite often wrong and so this this is this is perhaps deep in the DNA of my entire project and perhaps my ministry that I want places where people can talk I want places where people can disagree and I see it in some ways at the heart of you know how do I add Jordan Peterson and John Vervecki and nuance form and the meetups and John Van Donk my friend in Southern California and Job and why in the in the discord today I made an appeal that said you know if Christians are if Christians are dominating the conversation with our intramural things then then the discord server has a problem and and I noted that you know thanks to pink step and pink step and and Peterson and maps of meaning you got to let the minority in your community win 30% of the time or they'll just walk away and in some ways Protestants deal with their problems by walking away from it there's something deeply unhealthy about that but perhaps in in in denominations where they don't walk away there's the deep this ease of a marriage in which there's no conflict because there's no other things that need to be there that often produce the conflict so so yeah the note is the Nordic the note the note about Jordan at the very end of this video is misordered in terms of the sequence of videos and I try not to do too much sequencing of videos but from the best I tell a good number of people watch every video that I make or at least try to watch it if it's it serves them so I again you know back to my heart what do I want I want what Jesus prays for in John 17 that his church would be one and I want it's John Lennon that the world would live as one the one in the many we're still trying to figure that out and so maybe the title of maybe confessional conversation as a term will change but when I listen to when I listen to John Vervache and his his little cluster who are working on that and you know a guy saying stock and his circling that's a that's more of her vacant language that I haven't quite mastered but we're not looking to we're not looking to destroy one another we're looking to love one another that is the command of Christ to love each other up to and including your enemies and rivals and so yeah if if I'm not down on your the definition of a culture war is basically a gang war or a prison war where if you're not with me you're my enemy and I'm going to kill you and I think the definition of civilization is its opposite and what that means is we talk about things we don't want to talk about and so you know long-term Trinitarians talk to the biblical Unitarian and and actually we might adjust and recalibrate and maybe we'll rename we will remain under the Trinitarian flag but the way in which we try to understand the one and the three is more deeply nuanced because even when we were unselfconsciously under the flag we were insufficiently aware of the low-resolution grasp that we had and just as orthodoxy and heresy co-evolve so with good productive conversations we go further up and further in into the kingdom of God God number one and God number two so yeah again and perhaps too much front end but there's a reason I held this video for a week and I just watched it which I never do and I'm satisfied with it I'm never happy with any of my videos I'm satisfied with it and I'm not gonna delete it but I needed a front end that said the confessional conversation about same-sex marriage and I very much do want to I do want to get into the Mosaic law and this subject and some of you said well what about creation yeah that's that's creation is the big thing but as we put a lot of freight on Genesis 1 through 3 sometimes fairly sometimes unfairly so yeah this is this is a front end and I'll marry it to the rest of the video and here it is for Monday 18 19 will that be April 20 I don't know probably but here it is this is Paul last week I did a video on same-sex marriage and the Bible and got response to it number of people said they appreciated it some didn't I wanted to do another video I want to do a video on same-sex marriage and the Mosaic law but before I do that I wanted to do a video on a little bit more focus on same-sex marriage and why it's why it's such such a reactive issue what I mean by reactive well if you look at my conversation I had with dr. John Sook John like many note that for them this was a watershed issue that he simply could no longer in good conscience pastor in a church or a denomination where gay and lesbian people didn't have equal dignity that's usually the language that's used and many people feel that way and that's something that it's part of the reason that this is this is such a divisive issue people are so reactive to it part partly because for many people this issue is so instinctive it's pre-conscious for many people in terms of how they feel about it yet it seems to be an issue that's mutable for many many people have changed their mind on this so why is this topic so reactive the video I made predictably attracted attention and comments people are very sensitive about the topic and it's a relationship breaker this issue has broken up churches it's broken up families it's broken up relationships this both facilitates a conversation because it's not difficult to get interest but it impedes a productive conversation because people can't stand to hear nuance or tolerance tolerate differences in it and once you call someone a bigot a lot of people won't continue to talk to you or once you decide something else in this decision people will walk away now why well status and part of what was interesting about the the conversation between Eric Weinstein and Daniel Smaktenberg is the end of that three hour some long podcast at a very interesting conversation about status and I played some of that in the video that I talked about Weinstein and Smaktenberg the search for fulfillment beyond status and pleasure we as human beings are very sensitive to status and you will hear different reasons for that and depending how you stand on another hot-button issue such as evolution status is tied to a great many topics and subjects and status is a top-level matter of interest for us evolutionary biologists will say this is because we're primates it triggers that then triggers the evolutionary debate we might argue that because we're deeply social and we're more social than any great ape we find on the planet we have language we have complexity we are in fact very different now there are a lot of issues that historically in terms of human beings are boundary marker issues and these debates are often deeply tied as is this debate to religious questions as late as 1999 you can find the Dalai Lama if you do a little search Dalai Lama same-sex marriage you'll find or Dalai Lama homosexuality you'll find a variety of quotations from the Dalai Lama that don't look terribly in line with a lot of the people in our culture who really like the Dalai Lama but there are a bunch of other issues out there that you would imagine should also be just as divisive but aren't and I'd say two of them are food and body markings body markings can include tattoos if you look at certain African tribes there is scarring that will be on the face or the chest or the arms circumcision of course is a huge one and if you look at and Andrew Sullivan he's one of these people out there call circumcision male genital mutilation the the anti circumcision debate sort of like the anti-vaxxer debate that's a big one and you can generate some heat but it's failed to attract national interest in the way that same-sex marriage has attracted national interest food is another one you look at almost every significant religious tradition there are serious and seriously held food prohibitions Buddhists won't eat meat but they will eat plants Jews obviously have a fairly rigorous dietary law Muslims have a fairly rigorous rigorous dietary law in fact the dietary laws and circumcision if you read I made mention of the book of first Maccabees and my Palm Sunday sermon a couple of weeks back read the book of first Maccabees it's a fascinating book you know the the the Maccabean revolt happens over not only statues in temple but also sacrifices and and dietary laws and circumcision these things come up in Christianity in the New Testament quite often but in a different way and then I just I just found on Twitter today a dear prudence column my my white girlfriend told my black mom that eating vegan is like the civil rights movement my mom refuses to talk to my girlfriend until she apologizes but that that that gets into in a sense a neo-paganism a new rise in the relationship between food and morality that that we hadn't really seen in our culture in a long time now the reason for this is the significance of Christianity for our social history and again to bring up one more time Tom Holland's book Dominion which makes that point strongly the history of Christianity is deeply tied to Western culture Nietzsche saw that it should be the most obvious thing around dietary laws and circumcision were both blunted as religious issues by Christianity notice how hot they remain for Islam and Judaism food is a universal concern for religious moral communities in many ways just as much as sex is in Christianity in Christendom and post Christendom our religious moral flexibility around food is noteworthy and in some cases threatened now now why do I dare to discuss this matter of same-sex marriage there are a lot of reasons why I don't like talking about it in fact after I made this video I got into some discussions with some Christian friends that I deeply respect and it's just a tough decision and I don't like the drama I don't like the division that it causes between Christians that I respect deeply both straight and gay Christians I respect deeply and so these are tough tough issues and I in many ways because I'm in the Christian Reformed Church and because of where I am in the Christian Reformed Church this is a hard issue for me there was a few years ago I wrote a whole series of blog posts about this because I just had to think about it I had to think about it through blogging and through talking and it's really difficult to find productive conversation partners as a Christian surrounding this issue because there's so much polarization and the if you just pose a question that seems to be leaning towards one side or the other both sides jump in with what they think is their defeater thing and conversation closed now a friend that I that I made when I started making videos he contacted me very early and we have some mutual history he and I has started a thing called nuance forum with this with this I think terribly killer conversation bait let's say when was the last time you had a satisfying conversation it's like wow and so if you Google nuance forum you can find it and this is something that he's working on and if you live in Nashville Tennessee or Santa Barbara California it's something that you may be able to participate in once we all get out of lockdown but you know one of the things I really appreciated him is is that he talks about 10% conversations which are the conversations we have about the 10% of the things that we find it impossible to have conversations about and he talks about belly-to-belly conversations where we have to do this face to face and so in many ways he's been following what I've been doing with meetups that he's been he's been you know experimenting in other ways but but he and I are big believers in really we found each other via Jordan Peterson and it's no accident because Peterson was you know saw very quickly that you have to talk about these things if we're gonna think through them a big part of thinking is talking and of course Peterson you know brought in Jung and in this this idea that you will find what you're looking for in the place you don't want to look so so you will have to address what you need to address with the things you don't want to talk about but that's going to involve learning how to talk about what you want to very what you very much don't want to talk about and that is in keeping with my pastoral experience that if you go into an unhappy marriage there are things that people don't want to talk about and probably if you're a pastor or a therapist or just a friend trying to help them out some of those things they are going to have to talk about but they can't talk about it because they've tried talking about it and it hasn't gone well and everything's blown up in their face and so you find ways of talking about of of holding ideas in your head that you find abhorrent and it isn't it isn't that different in some ways from Jordan Peterson describing the the person with claustrophobia first you know looking at an elevator and then getting closer to the elevator or the first person with agoraphobia you know desensitizing it I mean we if we're going to make progress on polarized things we have to talk about difficult issues now maybe I'm crazy wanting to use YouTube for that but I'm probably crazy using YouTube at all so we proceed with caution and yeah they'll be they'll be they'll be people that unsubscribe to my channel because of this and there'll be people that drop a bomb in the comment section and run away from it they'll be people that just go into the comment section to troll but all of that has to be endured if you really want to look in these difficult places and have these difficult conversations and and if you work at it what and I've seen this in my friend who's doing nuance for him what you begin to develop are the skills to lead other people into it and and and this I think is one of the most important things we can do now that now it was very interesting for me when I brought up same-sex marriage bang it's almost like the word marriage isn't seen now marriage and sex are deeply tied but they're two separate topics in many ways and the reason they're not again is Christianity both are common concerns in religion almost every religion will have some degree well actually that's not even true if you look at a lot of ancient and I've made this comment in other places most ancient religious people what you did with your body sexually didn't matter it mattered to the Jews and therefore with the Abraham religions it mattered but in many other religions do what you want sexually as long as you pay the gods off at the temple and and do those rights and and and give your offerings to the priest and to the temple you can do whatever you want and if you don't believe me look at the classical period look at the Romans and the Greeks and there might have been lines and we'll get into some of those as we get into the series a little bit more there might have been lines to look at but for the most part a lot of religions ancient religions didn't police sexuality or at least not very much usually apart from some of the policing that went along with marriage and I've already talked about marriage a little bit that traditional marriage in the history of marriage marriage was about inheritance and bloodline and so in that case usually the sexual activity of women was policed but not so much men and I talked about that a little bit in the last video that will come up in further videos the Hebrews however were sexually peculiar and and were really compared to many other nations the nations around them quite prudish public nudity was not something that they were down with and the Hebrews were restrictive when it came to sexuality now Christianity in fact binds them more closely and intensifies not only some of the stuff that's implicit in the Hebrew scriptures but also equality at the same time so I have on my screen for those of you watching the video a couple of books Melinda Salmish which I'll probably bring these books in further on into the series sexual authenticity which is a fascinating book she's she's I don't remember if she's bi or lesbian but she becomes a Roman Catholic convert and works through the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church which as compared to many Protestant churches are particularly restrictive when it comes to certain topics and so it's a fascinating book where she reflects on these issues as she's trying to work through them as someone who's trying to be faithful to her church another fascinating book by Kyle Harper from shame to sin the Christian transformation of sexual morality in late antiquity and if you've read Tom Holland's Dominion you know that and I think Tom Holland is right on this and other authors have commented the types of issues we're dealing with today are in many ways analogous to the kinds of issues that were dealt with in late antiquity about the time of Augustine and one of the things that Tom Holland brings up quite clearly in some of the videos if you don't have to read his book you can watch a couple of his videos with unbelievable is that the Apostle Paul begins to admonish men to be bound to the same sexual ethic as women that's a radical thing in the world and and it frankly had become had become part of Christian aspirational sexuality and continued to be aspirational and continues to be aspirational but but that there in the connection of this Hebrew sexuality with with an idea of equality this is unique and transformational in the world because it's not pragmatic because of the differences in male and female and the Apostle Paul brings this in and that being in the New Testament changes the playing field and and that's deep within this conversation I would argue we'd not be having this conversation without Christianity and I made that point many times and I was really happy to hear Tom Holland make it because he's right he certainly didn't get the idea from me and I certainly had the idea long before I read any Tom Holland's books it's it's just true now what's interesting in the American political scene is that the Democratic Party and some libertarians tried to divide the question and and if you you're old enough to remember the debates before really the 20 teens 2004 Barack Obama opposed the Federal Defense of Marriage Act which was signed by Bill Clinton which allowed states to refuse to recognize same sex marriages legally established in other states it previously prevented the federal government from recognizing same sex marriages until the Supreme Court ruled that provision unconstitutional in 2013 but Barack Obama was against same sex marriage in his 2008 campaign the state of California voted against by majority same sex marriage in 2008 prop 16 you know big debates and just google you can read lots of articles from that time domestic partnerships giving same sex marriages the same legal rights equaling it but not using the word civil unions came up and we're going to get into this when we get into a couple of books on the history of marriage probably in in further episodes of this series you know the libertarian cry was keep government out of the bedroom and one person once said to me the love that wouldn't say its name now won't shut up the world has changed dramatically in a very short amount of time just and it just June go anywhere and you'll find rainbow flags everywhere hung by business you don't want to be on the wrong side of this issue if you're a business or you're going to get chick-fil-aid how did they win they made it about equality that's the key thing they made it about equality well how did that change the dynamic well remember hierarchy use one powerful Christendom value which is equality to submerge a less powerful already flagging one which is the Christian Christian aspirational norms surrounding marriage and sexuality which took a huge hit and the sexual revolution very clever way to win a political battle take two values in a hierarchy use one against the other make it about equality and even now what about same sex marriage it's about equality that's what this is about that that same sex couple should have equal dignity and people with same sex attraction should have equal dignity and that was what the Supreme Court decision was about it's about equality now equality and morality have a very interesting history in the United States the civil rights movement for the United States for generations became their living experience of morality and the involvement of Christianity in this is often lost and and again you see it in this joke that I saw my white girlfriend told my black mom that eating vegan is like the civil rights movement everything is like the civil rights movement because the civil rights movement became morality itself and this itself has a long history of the civil war Uncle Tom's Cabin Christian revivalism and nonconformity in many ways America was founded at the merger of two of humanity's most powerful forces the Puritans and pilgrims in New England they were religious nonconformists followed by the Quakers and other religious exiles out of Europe demanding religious freedom look at the story of Roger Williams in Rhode Island and industry really in many ways if you consider tobacco a drug the Virginia colonies would not have gotten started if it hadn't been for tobacco read 1493 Charles Mann's interesting book because all of the economy all of the the two colonies they were all struggling almost dying out if it hadn't been for rushes of new immigrants from England seeking religious freedom they couldn't agree with each other so they had separate colonies Quakers and Puritans they couldn't agree with each other and so in the north but in the bottom it was in the in the southern states it was tobacco it was tobacco that saved them because the world couldn't get enough tobacco and in fact in those colonies they had to require farmers to grow enough food because they were planting tobacco as fast as they could because it was selling as fast as it could and tobacco was in many ways the cocaine or the opium of the new world and America in many ways is the marriage of those two things religion and drugs and now so these things you know these things got going and it's also important to remember the progressive movement of the 19th century because that has a part to play in this but again a lot of this is not seen but what happens in the American psyche is that equality becomes such a driving force in the country that it really takes over and now this of course gets played out with what I call progressive liberationism and it's being played out with the woke wars today Neil Shenvy with his Shenvy apologetics he keeps reading these books and keeps writing these he keeps writing these little summaries of these books and book reviews of a lot of the books coming out from the the the critical theory tribes and you know just here's another chart that people say examples of manifestations of social oppression heterosexism who are the oppressors heterosexuals are the oppressors along with whites and Christians and men all the normal list what was the Christian aspirational norm but heterosexuality and it's now become an oppressing group moral status is given to those who are not from the oppressing group and people should ask a really difficult and uncomfortable question why the enormous and sudden spike of youthful sudden onset gender dysphoria it is is it biological is it genetic or is it social these are difficult questions but watching the kinds of crises that are going on a lot of which Benjamin Boyce has been has been keeping up with on his channel stuff is going on well we don't want to talk about it there's things you can't say and in fact Benjamin Boyce is documenting documenting how so many people can't say anything about this because they're afraid now the dirty little secret is well it's not really a dirty little secret read Andrew Sullivan Andrew Sullivan was an activist on the forefront of marriage equality but many of these activists grew up in the age of born that way and so marriage equality was one on the back of born that way is an immutable quality affording its status to a protected class but as many have been noting the B the T the Q and a lot of the other alphabet letters threaten the older activists and so as David Chappelle notes in his Netflix comedy show they don't all get along when they're in the same car and if you think if you think the social justice warriors are hot in terms of fighting heterosexual white males they really get up they really get upset by people like Andrew Sullivan and old time feminists you know turf says they're called so what happened was well they've sort of unleashed the they've they've seeded the wind and unleashed the whirlwind so there's continued movements in the high registers of Christian value stack which again is equality but also liberty and people's experiences are well I remember talking to a friend of mine who is a little older than I am I guess Andrew Sullivan was boy he's almost exactly my age a few years older five years older than Andrew Sullivan and I and he just told me he's a gay man and he said bisexuals are gays in denial and I thought oh if I would say that to my kids boy I'd really hear it and what we see from Protestant churches that have been in decline for a very long time this is the Wesley the the Wellesley village church in Wellesley Massachusetts they're a they're a sorry I got distracted they're a um a UCC united church it's not united church of christ i did congregation I forget what UCC stands for but they're one of the old new england congregational churches and they're a united church of christ i did congregation i forget what UCC stands for but they're one of the old new england congregational churches and similar to Unitarian Universalist but not exactly and when I was in Wellesley not too long ago you know they've got all of the correct flags out for a church of their style and then welcome is our favorite word and well welcome is their most earnest word because they're trying like crazy to bring in people now the question is why go to church and what happens in Protestantism is that there's this institutional modulation and they're they're celebrating the latest trends in social spirituality but the celebration has long since moved outside of the institutions and everybody's glad that they're there and doing things and you know they'll be fine and we certainly are you know they're not going to get written up in the newspaper for all the bad stuff that all these other more conservative people are doing and they're dragging their feet but they're just there waving their feet and they're just there waving their feet and they're just there waving their feet and they're just there waving their feet and they're just there waving their feet and they're just there waving their feet and they're just there waving their feet and they're just there waving their feet and they're just there waving their feet and they're just there waving their feet and they're just there waving their feet and they're just there waving their feet and they're just there waving their feet and they're just there waving their feet and they're just there waving their feet and they're just there waving their feet and they're just there waving their feet and they're just there waving their flags but these issues are not easy for them either because the question of policing or not policing is a very real one and so actually when I have these conversations with people who are on the left in Christianity I'll ask them I'll say you know um tell me what sexuality you will police and I'll have people say to me I I think it's wrong for churches to police anyone's sexuality and I say oh really well I hear progressives declare that they refuse to police the sexuality of the people but policing sexuality is a staple of progressive activism you know if if you know there's a there's a situation in Australia where a Roman class the highest ranking Roman Catholic clergy was sent to jail and just recently released by an Australian court for sex abuse charges and these are big issues I regularly find on Twitter many people from affirming churches who are just ready to denounce all kinds of people their policing sexuality well it's about consent well I agree I think consent is vital well it's about it's about protecting children I believe children are should be protected but these issues get very complicated very quickly and as much as some conservatives want some bright lines around certain areas that they have difficulty living with the lack of lines in left-leaning churches are equally difficult to live with because to police or no police well everybody's got a moral list that they need to police and at least traditional Christianity for all of the failings that it had at least they had a line that they understood even if so often they couldn't keep it themselves and if you watch any of Jonathan Peugeot's videos you realize that this is all stock of of human of human beings the point that Jonathan makes continuously is something will try to bring order to the chaos you have your center and you have your periphery and you're always going to have these structures and these structures lay themselves out and people try to deny these structures but they keep emerging and Jonathan is sort of a gadfly that's just out of the box out there bringing the bringing up these uncomfortable things and noticing uncomfortable things about we're not going to police anyone I don't believe it I don't believe it at all because I'm watching you you're very excited about morality it's just your list of morality has changed so exiling your adversary seldom yields understanding almost right away when I almost right away when I posted this video one of the first comments I saw was this it's really a shame that Christians can't accept homosexual people now there's so much framing and so much newness in that sentence that because we're not familiar with it we probably don't understand Tom Holland makes the point that a hundred years ago there was no such thing as homosexual people he said well what do you mean there have been gay people forever yeah there certainly have certainly been people have been attracted to members of the same sex there's been many many people who have had sexual activity either in a committed way or in an opportunistic way with people of the same sex and other sex throughout humans history but the identity is a new thing and that identity has been part of the conversation we've been having using the Bible to justify bigotry is not any type of Christianity I would want to follow okay is that what I'm doing is you know there are layers to this cake that has been that have been baked and all the usual suspects are nested within it identity where does it come from if you do something once do you now are you now a part of that group? How about if you do something twice? How about if you do something and regret it? How about if you do something and think you never should have? How about if you liked it then but don't like it now? How about if your attractions have changed? Human beings are really complex and these things change all the time and if we just change our labels does that mean something? Some people who change their labels it's publicly accepted other people if they change their labels it isn't presuming the motives of others? You don't even know our own motives half the time you can sugarcoat it all you like is that what I was doing but if you view homosexuality as sinful what is homosexuality? Is it something that happens between two men under what circumstance in what context how many times? What are we talking about? These are all not easy things so now I'm complicating it okay because I'm a bigot okay and you know what I say to people often is I'm a Calvinist I'm a bigot I'm a racist I'm all of these things I believe all of those things are in my heart so okay we would not choose our orientation any more than straight people choose to be straight well there's a whole lot of things we don't choose yet we do them some of the things we do that we haven't chosen I mean again these issues are not quite so for some people they're very same-sex attracted they're they're not very attracted to the opposite sex other people are very attracted to the opposite sex not much experience about same-sex attraction but a lot of studies before a lot of this said people are on a spectrum that doesn't really sit well with born that way to what degree is this volitional to what degree is this not volitional these are really hard questions and they're not questions that are only important within this sphere of conversation you will regularly find people who gave some kinds of means of consent for some kind of sexual activity and then later regret it and then their idea about how consensual it was well that story changes this is very difficult stuff to condemn us based on who we are is hateful and hurtful is this little list of declaring whites Christian men able-bodied middle-class people of every category is that hurtful is that hateful I mean we're gonna have to one of the things that I I notice is that well people sometimes are something like emotional burn victims they can't take much they can't take much looking into things and they're not going to be able to do that and I'll have to confess I was quite reactive to this comment and I had to check myself and say okay this person I don't know who this person is this is part of the problem with the Internet I'm not talking to this person face to face of us talking to this person face to face I would probably be a lot more gentle a lot more patient a lot less dogmatic and probably try to relate to them as a person but in this impersonal realm of the Internet it just feeds this this reactivity the fact is you are choosing to follow a book written by man okay and hiding behind your faith as an excuse to hate homosexuals in other words there's these group of homosexuals out there the person who writes this knows nothing about my family or my personal relationships they're presuming an awful lot that I hate all these people or I hate what they're doing or really you know that about me you know how I feel about this issue should I not work through this issue how about all of these people that are reactive about this issue and they have a whole lot of stuff in them that they haven't chosen either reactivity either way how do we live together if we can't talk about these things if we can't share honestly about these things and again as I talk about meetups I've dealt with not necessarily this issue but how many theological issues and difficult things I remember when Sam the biblical Unitarian came onto my channel and we had a conversation and I saw a lot of Christians from my channel who watch my videos first contact with Sam was pretty reactive oh here's a non-Triditarian these are these are in fact reactions that had been built into us from 1500 years ago us I mean by us this stuff is complicated and if we can't talk about it we can't make progress and quite frankly that's a gift I think that's been given to the conversation by the left because in many ways it was the left that said we need to talk about it and they were right because a lot from the right wouldn't talk about it it was all reaction it was all fear well we're going to have to dial back the fear toughen up our skin and try to have a productive conversation it takes a great deal of time if you look at some of the videos I've done on the church side of things a lot of people are done talking on both sides I don't think there's any point in talking talking doesn't change minds okay maybe minds won't be changed but maybe we'll understand each other a little bit and maybe we'll learn be able to live with one another with a little bit more generosity a little bit more grace maybe we'll be able to work together on things that aren't connected to this thing maybe we can in fact do less do less straw manning do mess do less reactivity and actually have a productive conversation so I might continue making more videos about this so take a deep breath because stuff will trigger you and actually a pandemic might not be a bad time to talk about this why because we're focused on something else and maybe maybe it is maybe it isn't but nobody's putting a gun to your head saying watch Paul Vanderclay's videos you can unsubscribe anytime you want back when I was taking a closer look at subscribing and unsubscribing I would notice that people subscribe and unsubscribe in a fairly regular basis and maybe some of them based on how I've ticked them off this week and how I haven't how gay marriage became a constitutional right well guess what thanks to the Supreme Court whether you agree with them or not they put this into a certain category and took it out of the legislative process now that is both a blessing and a curse as I think we've seen by Roe versus Wade the Supreme Court is a way of both taking a hot potato off the table and ensuring that it'll stay hot for a decade and that's sort of what's happened to Roe v. Wade and that continues there's another terribly reactive conversation that we have and again I agree with my friend my friend is that we need to be able to talk about things like this and I intend to and what that means is that people will not agree with me and you can call me a bigot in the comment section you can call me stupid you can call me anything that you want I won't say it never hurts most of the time it really doesn't but I won't say that it never hurts and I won't say that I won't get reactive but usually what happens when I get reactive in the comment section is a few hours go by and someone in my consciousness Congress pops up and says did you really want to leave that comment was that really the way to love this other individual to be a Christian means loving your neighbor as yourself all the way up to and including your enemy or your adversary in a hot button political thing so it's a constitutional right in America it isn't going to change right away so you know what maybe we can talk about it everyone's anxious and a lot of people will traditional Christians they have so much power it depends a lot on where you live in the country traditional Christian communities have a lot to lose in this look at the question about Christian colleges financial aid there's a lot going on in this and a lot of Christians are very scared about this and you might say oh they have it coming okay well maybe they do but we got to talk about it and I want to find ways of talking well about it so let's have the conversation now in my last video I talked a little bit about Jordan and some of you thought maybe I was too hard on Jordan I think in many ways I mean my I don't have a personal relationship with Jordan Peterson we've only conversed we have that one half hour conversation which you can find on YouTube on my channel we've had slight conversations via email a couple of times hardly anything he sent me a very gracious note when my daughter died or my daughter died when my sister passed away I sent I've sent him some notes just extending my sympathy and prayer for his wife's illness and his own illness and that that's it I don't think it is I don't think you're doing Jordan Peterson a favor by putting him up on a pedestal why because as a pastor I know I am most wary of the people who put me on a pedestal because it's for their own reasons that they put me on a pedestal and they can very quickly and very easily take me down from that pedestal and I'll tell you you can find this in the Jordan Peterson community those people for who put Jordan up on a pedestal and then kick them off it that's no fun if you're the person that's been put on the pedestal and been kicked off so when I see someone putting me on a pedestal I take a step back I'm going to read the slate read the slate star codex codex review of twelve rules for life and I'll just read a little bit of first part of his blog posts are very long so I got Jordan Peterson's twelve rules for life for the same reason as the 210,000 people as the other 210,000 people now maybe more like three or four or five million people to make fun of the lobster thing or if not the lobster thing then the neo-marxism thing or the transgender thing or or or the thing where the neo-marxist transgender lobsters wants to steal your your precious bodily fluids but uh I'm really embarrassed to say this I totally understand if you want to stop reading me after this or revoke my book review license or whatever but guys twelve rules for life is actually good the best analogy I think of is CS Lewis Lewis was a believer in old religion which at this point has been reduced reduced to a cliche what could be less interesting than hearing that Jesus loves you or being harangued about sin or getting promised heaven or threatened with hell but for some reason when Lewis writes the cliches suddenly work Jesus love becomes a palpable force sin becomes so revolting you want to take advantage

the discord server and it was what brought myself in my friend who started nuance forum was brought as what brought us together. Can's-so Jordan thank you because you did this and you did it well. I really hope you get well and I really hope your second book. to the first book. I hope you break new ground. I hope you're healthy. I really want you to come back. I really want you to do Exodus. But what Peterson did was open up a space for many of us to have difficult conversations because we need to. And we need to have them about this topic. And Christians need to figure out how to do it because they've done it poorly. And people on the left need to figure out how to do it because they've done it poorly. We need each other and we need to work through difficult things.
