 Welcome to the Freddie and Paul show. This is, do you have any idea what episode this is? 53. 53? Alright, 53. And here we are at Living Stones on Palm Sunday. Marshall made us, we got two of them on. Alright, alright, it's Palm Sunday. Two for the goodness. Two is better than one. Because we are united in Christ and he says if one person follows Christ, the other one will follow because they will give them wisdom of thought and if one person comes to Christ you can bring someone else to Christ and it's like a unity. Okay, okay, good, good. So what should we talk about today? Palm Sunday. Palm Sunday, okay. Today is Palm Sunday. What do you think that means? Christ rising from death from when he was crucified, right? It's next week. Oh, that's Easter. Okay, then he died. He died for our sins. Yeah, that's Good Friday. Okay, Good Friday's he died for our sins. So what, do you remember what this is about? When he rose again. No, no, no, because why they have the palms and Jesus comes into Jerusalem and Hosanna. He comes in the tomb. But what about, oh, because they put him in the tomb. Yeah, but that happens later. The Palm Sunday is when Jesus comes into Jerusalem as the king. Oh, I see. I misunderstood. I misunderstood. That's okay. That's what we talked about in the sermon today. Jesus was riding the colt. That was a wild colt. Yeah. Did he get bucked? He didn't get bucked. That's the whole point. Good, good. And he knew what he was doing. That's the whole point of the story. Right on. And basically, go ahead and talk. And I'll conversate. Go ahead. I don't know what you want me to talk about. Palm Sunday. Well, about Jesus rides into Jerusalem. He's the king of creation. Right. He's the king of the Jews. He's the king of Israel. He's the king of the world. King of the world. And he was received as king on that day. But then the story is that Jerusalem rebels against him in a sense, and then they crucify him. Oh, but that's not good. That's not good. But everything worked out good because now he died for our sins, and now we follow Jesus. And if you follow Jesus, you shall be born again. Like he was. He was born again. He died and he came back. That's why we say he died for our sins. Now he's back for us and he is resurrected. That's right. That's the Christian story. All right. Cool, cool. So are you following the final four? Yeah. Michigan won. Oh, yeah. They beat Florida State by 15 points. Okay. And who else played? Someone? Purdue and somebody. And then the other one, I don't know. But do you know of any other marines? I haven't followed the college basketball at all. Okay. Michigan's in it. So that's good. So shout out to Derek. Michigan. Hi, Derek. Our friend Derek. Thank you for Michigan. And anyway, anyway, Paul, so what do you think of the Kings, man? They beat Atlanta. They won another game, too. Guess who they played tonight or tomorrow? Who? Boston Celtics. Oh, okay. Are the Celtics any good this year? They're okay, but they can beat them. You know who lives near Boston? Who? Our friend Derek. What? I don't know if he follows. Derek, do you root for the Celtics? I don't know. Well, we root for the Kings. We do root for the Kings. Oh. We'll have to ask Derek who he roots for. Just to mention, are we going to a game? Maybe. Maybe we'll go to a game April 11. First search out. For a church outing. For a church outing. God would like that. Would he? Oh, I got to do a song and then we got to go. You can do a song? Why are you standing up? Because I get my paper. Oh, okay. All right. Go ahead and start talking while I find what you want. What do you want me to talk about? Whatever you want to talk about. This is your show, Freddie. No, it's not my show. It's your show, too, Paul. It's my show, too. It's a unity in Christ. No, I'm serious. I know you're serious. You just say it in a funny way. You always make me laugh. I'm sorry. No, that's not something to be sorry about. It's a good thing. Okay. Because it's better to laugh than to cry, right? Yeah, laughter is the best medicine. Laughter is the best medicine. Okay. What song are you going to sing? In Christ Alone. In Christ Alone? I'm just going to do one verse. Okay. Are you going to rap it or are you going to sing it? I'm going to sing it. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm going to sing it. Okay. Okay. I'm going to sing it. Okay. I'm going to sing it. Okay. I'm going to sing it. Okay. Okay. In Christ alone my hope is found. He is my light, my song. This cornerstone, this solid ground. Firm through the fierce drought and storm. What heights of love, what depths of peace. When fears are stilled, when driving sees. My comforter, my all in all. Here in love, Christ I stand. He took alone, who took my flesh. Fullness of God in helpless babe. This gift of love and righteousness. Gorn by ones he came to save. Till on that Christ he died. The wrath of God was satisfied. For sin on him was laid here in death. Of Christ I live. Thank you Jesus for trying for my sins. I love you very much and I always come in. I love my pastor and name is Pastor Paul and you know that we stand tall. Glory, hallelujah, amen. Amen. That was a good song Fred, I like that. I relived it at the end. I told you I'm a master of ceremony. I love it Paul. We're so good together. I don't know where I get all this goodness from. I don't know where it comes from. I really don't. I don't know either Fred. It's just awesome. It is awesome. It is awesome. That's why we have our show. I know it's just like spur of the moment. It comes to me and God gave me this gift and it's just good. It's just good. Okay we'll see you next week. Alright. One, ready, one, love. Amen hallelujah on Sunday.
