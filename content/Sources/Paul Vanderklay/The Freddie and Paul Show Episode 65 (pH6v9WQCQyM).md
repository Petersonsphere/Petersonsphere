 Welcome to the Freddie and Paul Show. This is episode... 64 I believe. No it is 64. Because it was 63 last week. I think it was 64 last week. I think it's 65. You might be right. I think it might be 65. Okay. You think it's 65? Yeah I think so. I just wanted to tell you something Paul. What? Thank you. I was wondering if I could possibly do this channel and then do my own channel like you do your ministry so I can minister to others. Sure. You can do your own channel. Would you help me with that? Sure I'll help you set something up. Okay. And people out there and I had and I wanted to let anybody know if you can contact Paul if you can help me with my music and get my music out there you know in the different venues because I got my boy CJ with me and we're where's the magic and we want to get stuff going on again you know. We're not young bucks anymore. We're still young bucks because I'm a disciple of the Lord and I want to help others through my ministry like you because I'm proud of you with your ministry sir and for so how long I known you I'm very pleased to say I I'm happy to know you because I've came a long way and I'm not trying to butter you up like a buttermilk biscuit. Okay thank you Fred. That's very kind. So what do you want to talk about today? Well like I said last week what about those warriors? What about those warriors? Kevin Durant got an MVP. Did he? Okay good. Stefan Curry did really good this year. Clay Thompson did good this year. They had a follow up with Clay Thompson because he helped the team. Livingston and Iguodaca came back when they won. I think that's how you say his name. And the Giants lost to the Dodgers but that's okay. Anyways I know all the sports. I know all the media. You know my brother Gordon he teaches me these things and he tells me about the media and I listen and I just remember. I have kind of like a photographic memory. I can remember stuff very well and I'm pleased to thank the Lord for that and yeah. So today I'm going to do, we're going to do Who's That Guy? He's Fred D but I'm not going to do the chorus. If we can get it on the loudspeaker we will. And yeah Paul do you have anything else to say? I was talking. Talking's good. Tell them about your channel a little bit. No people already know about my channel because they're on here already. It's all the same channel. Alright well that's very good. Oh yeah. You were going to rap for your father right? No not rap just read it. Okay. Hi everybody. My father went to this church. He was a very noble man. He taught me a lot of good things because you're in command. Jesus Lord thank you for my father. He brought me a long way. Now I have my mom to bring me a long way but Pastor Paul is like my father in Christ so I'd like to say a few words if I could. Is that okay? That's your show. It's our show. Here we go. Happy Father's Day to all the fathers out there. My dad in heaven someday I hope to see him. Did your mom write this? Yeah. Is in heaven someday I hope to see him. He was a servant of God in our church. He even built, he even spent many hours putting brick around the church building and stuff. So that was good. And together for making the church look better. Respectable. So when you come to church you see a church and the way the church looks it means a whole lot. Because if you see a pattern, you know, it's like a pattern. If you follow God he will come to you like fishers of man will reel them in, you know? So basically, okay, now I'm going to do my thing. We've got to pause for a minute. Go ahead and pause it Paul.
