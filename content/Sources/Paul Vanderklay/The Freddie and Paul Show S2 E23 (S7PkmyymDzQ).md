 Welcome to the Freddie and Paul show. Hey there Fred. I'm okay. What about those Niners? We're high on those Niners. Those Niners are doing good. Big upset. The Titans beat the Ravens. So it could be Niners against Super Bowl. I'm just going to look at Ravens. Ravens. Oh he's really good. I forget his name right now. But he's having a great year. He had a great year. All those Russian yards. Was it Johnson? Yeah something like that. You find it? Yeah I called it. It's not fair. Okay. Okay so. Help us with what? I was going to ask them to help us with football stats. No I don't. Because he watched football. I don't know. I wasn't able to watch it. Because it wasn't on. It wouldn't tune in. Oh okay. But I found out later that the 49ers won. Thank you very much. And let's see. Who are the Seahawks playing? The Seahawks are playing Kansas City. How do you think Kansas City is going to win that? Mahomes is a good quarterback. That's the one I was thinking of. Yep. Yep. Yep. And let's see. Who else is left? Titans? Titans. Titans will be playing the Niners next week. Wow. They're going to win. No no. Titans are in the AFC. So Titans will be playing the... Texans. Whoever wins. Texans. Oh is it Texans? I don't even know. Oh Texas is Kansas City. Oh okay. Texas is Kansas City. Okay. Alright. Let's talk about that. I know a lot about your sermon. Oh okay. I just kind of got that if you follow the Lord and believe in him and ask him for guidance, but not all the time. But if you ask him for guidance, he'll help you through the way with all the thin and thick things that go on. So if you have a problem and go to the Lord with it and get it off your shoulder, if you feel better about yourself. You do? Jesus will praise you and he will be happy that you uplifted his voice. Okay. Sounds good Fred. Baseball will be coming pretty soon. Baseball is coming soon. Yep. But I think the 49ers are going to win against the whole thing. They could. They could take it all. I think there's going to be some good playoff games coming up. Yeah, let's pray that Mom, I hope you get better because we need you on the program. You have a good personality. Yes. That's right. Nancy does have a good personality. We've got a lot of good comments that we've been having. Yeah, yeah. We've been getting a lot of good comments lately. And I was going to say that, one more thing. What was I going to say? Oh, thank you for all the comments everybody. And if you tune in, you'll learn a lot from our show because it's spontaneous. It's the rotation of the secondhand motion. Monty vision, puggy pug vision. It's all good, you know, and it's all for God because God is the one and only. In Jesus name, amen. Amen. All right, ready? Yep. Close it. Do a rap. You can do a rap? Okay. Just a slow one. A slow one? A short one. Okay. Jesus, Jesus, you're the one. You came to us to be your son. I will love you in all the ways. We're doing YouTube and we love to praise. Hallelujah, Lord has come. We're here for you and I am your son. I love you very much because you died for my sins. It must have been hard but I love you my friend. You are so good and you are so right. I love you Jesus Christ because you praise me and you love me all night and every day. Because Jesus Christ I love to pray when I praise your name, your holy word. When I'm on the mic it's not absurd. All right. Let's land the plane. Land the plane. What up? How was that? That was good.
