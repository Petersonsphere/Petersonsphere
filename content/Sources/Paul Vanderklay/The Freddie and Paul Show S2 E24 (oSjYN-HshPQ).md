 Welcome to the Freddie and Paul show. Nancy is back from her long absence from the show. Welcome back Nancy. Good to have you back. Thank God to be back. I missed you guys. Yeah. Why don't you bust a rap about my ankle and my food poisoning? No, I don't think so. Just don't eat chicken with blood in it. Just don't do that. Anyhow, salmonella is not fun. And eat steak well done. Yeah. Yeah, hamburger. Yeah. Food poisoning is no good. So what are we going to talk about today? Well basically your sermon. Well we gotta start with sports. Sports always comes first in the show. Yeah, yeah, because everybody likes it. Everybody likes the sport. So Niners. Go 49ers. Are in the Super Bowl. Okay. Go. They can do it. They can do it. But they got to put Kittle in there. If they don't, they might have a problem. What's going on with Kittle? Kittle was hardly in the playoffs. So why? They still won. Oh I know why Paul. They didn't want him to get entered because if he would have got entered then he would have been out in the finals. In the Super Bowl. Yeah. Yeah. Oh hey J. Lowe, how you doing? I hope you do a good Super Bowl performance. Is she doing the Super Bowl? Yeah. And Celine, who's the other one? Shakira. Yeah. Okay. How you say her name? I have no idea. What's up T. Grizzly? I hope you're doing good. I've seen your music. It's pretty tight man. Pretty good. Kind of out of sight. Anyways. So Super Bowl. Looking for a Super Bowl next week. Anything else? Kings won. That's a good thing. Kings did win twice. But they were losing a lot. Let's see what else. Baseball will be coming soon. Baseball is coming soon. Let's hope the A's and the Giants are optimistic and got the total rotation and the total velocity of the second hand motion. There you go. You know some people wonder what that means. It's too Freddy Fred vocabulary. Well what does it mean? Can you interpret it? Okay well right now. Okay. The total velocity is what is going on. Well you're fine. The third hand motion is well in this house. So. Thank you. More administrative stuff. Yep. Where's the deacons from today? So basically what I'm saying is I'd like to do a wrap and then I guess we'll close the show. No we got the Nancy's Got Her Sermon Report. Oh okay. So we did the sports. Now we're going to do the sermon report and we'll do the wrap. Kind of like the Jay Leno show. Kind of like the Jay Leno show. Yeah. All right Nancy's Sermon Report. What'd you think of the sermon? Nancy comments that she watches the rough draft and then she watches the sermon and they're not always the same but she thought today was quite a bit of commonality. If you want to watch the sermon you can go over to the Living Stones YouTube channel and you can find the sermon there. Okay. Right. And I didn't have a pen so I didn't take notes in church so basically what I got out of it uh is everybody has their own views and you have to accept what they their views are. Now what's going on honestly is everybody's has their own view for this election for this what we're doing with Trump. Yeah you got your pros and cons. Pros are good. Cons are not so good. So you need to look at things positive and enlightening and joyful and praise Jesus' name because he thinks you are like fame and stuff you know. If you if you pray to God you'll be pray to God you'll be famous. Well you'll go to you might have it. You might have eternal life. You will. Yeah. That's what Paul says. Okay. He knows. So I'm curious about the sermon here so. Yeah let's get back to the sermon. Yeah back to the sermon. Right now we're going through a tough time. Okay but let's not talk about the news. And I don't know who's right and who's wrong. All right. I don't I can't pick which one. So that's kind of scary for the country. Okay. But everybody. God's gonna pick who is our president. And that's the way I see it. All right. So if you want to see if Nancy got the sermon right you watch the sermon and you can be the judge of the relationship between the sermon report and the sermon. So. And please reach out fans for the views. If you have a comment let us know if you would like us to talk about anything that is substantial and enlightening towards Jesus' name and the holy God. And we will get back to you with the comments that you respond to. And I think the show is an uplifting show because most shows don't talk about God. But God is what's the best. If you don't have Jesus you have no reason. He's in the world. So yeah Paul that's what I have to say. Okay. All right. So anything else before the wrap. You got a wrap for us today. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Ready. Yeah. We're going to stay clean. You shall be in church and stop looking at the girls with the mini skirts because God put me on this earth to preach and if you don't understand you're out of reach. I said read your Bible. Pray every day. That's the only way you're going to make it. Man I'm Yosemite. I'm not Yosemite. Sam I'm Freddie B from the 916 all over the colony. One two three. It might be like this G because Jesus Christ is the reason for the season you see. I might be white but I can get down. My friends roll the crown when I'm up and down. Fourth and back. I love the wrap because of something like that. You pray to God and he will reach your holy word and if you don't understand that's absurd. This is the vocabulary of Freddie Fred. I have so much talent because God said I was a good man. Okay. Ready to go like one two three. Thank you very much Paul and Mommy. See. All right. There we go. There's Freddie and Paul's show for today. We got a sports report. We got a sermon report. We got a wrap. Perfect. The full show. Yeah. All right. Just got to land the plane. All right. One love. Amen. We'll be back next week. All right.
