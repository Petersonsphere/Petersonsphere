 What's hot? It's your boyfriend, he is. Has a 916. Got my sidekick, Charles Jack. Don't forget about Poly Paul. And yo, he stands tall. He's got a curl to the rockin' world. And me, I got a jerry curl. Juice, that is. Really? I didn't know that. Okay, I was looking for the juice in there, jerry curl. Juice, juicy, juicy. Is juicy the juice curl? Don't you know? Mixed with my every single thing. When you're right, try to mix. We're on the show. Jesus Christ knows. We're good to go. Without a word to say. Charles Jane, you're okay. Oh, they're okay in my book. Oh, I had to take a second look. What did I do? I saw Rick with my crew. And then he knows what to do. He's driving his white truck. Rolling down the street. The guy we trust. But this is good. On the microphone would I could. Would I coulda? Or maybe so? Don't forget about mama so. That's good to go. The Freddie and Paul show. Now we do our show really though. There you go. I like that. Alright. Anywhere Paul. The Astros play the Braves. Wow. They're still talking. My thing is talking. But it's alright. We all be talking. Sackle and Rattalk. Okay, the Kings beat Phoenix on the road. So that's a good sign. That's a good sign. And they beat the Lakers like I told you last week. Sac State won. Sac State football won. Got some college football. Davis won. Davis won. And the whole one. I'm trying to think. Baseball. The Astros lost to the Braves. So it's going to be the Braves. And who? I'm trying to remember. Braves. Another team. Do you remember? I don't follow baseball anymore. Okay, football. Who do you got for football today? I'm hoping that Tom Brady has a good game. I'm hoping that Kamara has a good game. So we'll see. I'm playing my son Philip today. Who has Carr? Who has Derek Carr? I have no idea who has Derek Carr. I have Brady. Brady's been doing very well in fantasy football this year. And my sidekick, he's right here. And don't even trip. Because we're going to have two songs coming out for sure. Calling our team. What was it? Calling our team. What was it? Our Lord and Savior. Of course. And I always care. We went to the studio. And they didn't even tell us that we could not use the beats. They just went along with the session. And I thought that was unprofessional. Because they should have told us. So if you're out there, call them. And the other guy's name was? It doesn't matter. Yeah, it doesn't matter. But it wasn't right. It was unique. You recorded with some beats that you couldn't. Yeah, you couldn't publicize. You couldn't really sell them. You could just put them out on YouTube but you couldn't really sell them. For a promotion, that's it. But we can't sell them. That's what made me upset. That's what made me upset. Anyway. Hope you'll watch your mom. I'm sure your mom will watch. If she's not on the show, she even watches the shows that she's on. Yeah, there you go. We got some good ones out there too. And some of our show here the other time got picked up from some of the other channels that watch me. That was fun. That was cool. Go ahead. Oh, he's still trying to have me freestyling or something. Yeah. Okay, ready? Yeah, because it's music. I'm trying to get the music going. That's really easy. No. Please charge. And they sent me as a charge of speaker too. For the record. I had it going. Here, get this on. I got it here to go in? I'll do it then. Thank you. Somewhere it's going to be stronger. So where you been up to? Me? Working too much. Okay, Charles. Sorry about the delay, people. But we're going to get it going now. On. Power. That's why they got DJs to do this. Yeah, I agree. Just hit play and you might get somewhere right now. There you go. Just have the volume up. Oh, that's loud. That's loud. I think he's trying to hype me up again. His bag is still dying out here. But anyway. The C-H-A-R-L-E-S. I represent Jesus Christ, you see. I'm going live right here from the head. I never did this before so I don't want to be dead. But I'm here to kick you on the Freddie and Paul show. To let you know this is the way to go. I got my own show. The Charles Jendricks channel. Come. Don't wear flannel. Okay, I'm done. Oh yeah. I'll come in and rock the world. Because my home Charles A rocks the girls. He loves them. I'm a little bit of a young age British. But I don't like breasts in the space like in 102. Back in the day. That wasn't cool. Okay? Too much info. It's a family show here. We were talking about stuff last week. And now this comes up. You guys came up with that comment. That was out of a sermon. It was not salacious in any way. And now you're talking about other anatomical things. I'm telling them what happened at the radio station. I don't want to know what happened at the radio station. That was a low-atomical by the way. It wasn't my choice. Okay. Are we going to land the plane? We'll land the plane. Forgive us everybody. Forgive us everybody. We'll be good. Okay. All right. All right. Let's do this all the way over. We're not going anything over. The show is one cut all the time. Never a change. I know but it will be better if we... No. Second time is never better. Isn't it better if we do the second time around? No. We want to edit a version. Okay I won't do no song but I want to do it over. No. I'm going to be pissed. Besides I want to do my Christian song. Do it quick now. No doing it over. Can I add it? Can you add what? I'll do it without a beat I guess. Or with a beat. Okay here we go. Oh my god. Oh you guys are watching me. I'm watching you. The battery was low. I'm telling you the battery is low. I can tell them too. You got to just do it right from the phone now. There goes all that we did now. I got to see a mighty fortress wrapped here. There you go. Can we hold this? Yeah you can. Ow. Cool. I didn't turn the power off. The battery is low. She kept telling us. No it's on. She kept telling you it's dying. No it's on. See I told you. Alright here we go. I'll do my song. Okay now you move by the way. You have some more. Okay. Hey hey hey. What's up y'all. Yeah. Oh yeah. A mighty fortress is our god. A bold work. Never failing. Never. A mine of blood. Of the mortal. Take that one out. I have to practice more. Yeah it'll be done. Alright alright. That battery is dead. I kind of wanted to hear a mighty fortress too. I know what that song was. It makes me mad though. I thought we were going to have this done right. Everything came a bond on me. It's okay. It's alright. It's okay. Okay now. Can we save the other one and take that one out? Take what out? I don't edit anything. I don't edit anything. Oh no. Our fans like it fresh. We keep it real. I'm the already call shot. No editing. What you see is what you get. One love.
