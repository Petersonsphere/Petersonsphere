 Hi, how y'all doing out there? This is a pretty ball show, but this time we have a guest appearance, Mr. Mark Holland, my number one cousin. He's from another generation, but he's in my generation, and he's got that federation. Yeah. Anyway, balls over. Yeah, you've been preaching for years here. You've been doing the thing. You've been in ministry, and you've gone to class for ministry, and now you're a minister. I've been to your church, and I really got a lot out of it. I thought it was good, prosper. I thought it was nice. So tell us a little bit of what your church is generated out of. Yeah, well, thanks, man. Thanks, Brady, for that great introduction. Yeah, we meet out here on the lawn, right outside your church. So you came by, and I was so psyched to see you come and sit down. Well, you're my cool cousin, man. I'll be there. When I do a concert sometime, I want you there, man. Yeah, I wanna be there. Yeah, so anyways. Yeah, that's great, man. Anyways, basketball, the Kings didn't make it, but get this, even the Pantheoniers didn't make it. Yeah, well, LeBron left them. Yeah, left them. Why'd you leave them? All they got is Kevin Love. Yeah, oh, they have Seth Curry, but he was injured, right? Seth Curry? Or Stephon Curry. Steph Curry, he's over at the Warriors. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but he was healthy, but that wasn't enough, right? Wasn't enough. Yeah, so who should we go for now? Brooklyn? Brooklyn Nats? Brooklyn's a good bet. It's a good bet, because they're looking good. You know who else is looking good? Yeah, you wanna? And I don't think they made the playoffs. Yeah, they didn't make the playoffs. Okay. Who do you like? You like LA? Say hi to my mom. Oh. Say hi to my mom, to Nancy. Hey, Nancy. Hi, Nancy. Anyways, she was here, you know, one time? Yeah. And she did a rhyme herself, and it was pretty cool. Apple doesn't move? She knows how to do it, yeah. She got, that's where I got it from her. Yes. She knows how to rhyme. She knows how to sing, and she has a good voice. But anyways. Good job, Nancy. Mark, yeah, so are we coming to church? You'll be here, you do it again next week, right? 9 a.m. every week. Okay. Tell all your, like all your fans and stuff. He has church at 9 a.m. every Sunday, and he can, they can tune into your program, right? Mm-hmm, yeah. VE Live? Yeah. And I'm gonna do my performance now, and I think we basically got everything worked out, so. Sweet. Yeah, ready? One, love. Okay, now I'm gonna do it. You gonna stay seated? Oh yeah, that's fine. Oh, we're really doing this. Yeah. You gonna bust a run? No, I don't got anything. I don't got it, man. Okay. Just be in bright mind. Okay, I'm ready, McGriff. Oh yeah, 916 Grizzly. Yeah, you know how we do it. Real live, real tight, cause I excite to a true delight, like some delight. I got my rhymes tight, don't you know? I'm not gonna go without the solo. Gotta come up like this, gotta come up like that. One up to the chat, my rhymes are fat. I bust platinum trash, out to speak up. Nine months later, they announced me as the preacher, but preacher Paul, and March Dance Tall, he knows it all, and you know we gotta keep going for all. Goodness of our generation, Jesus cried for our sins in our federation. Coming up, keeping it really cool. Jesus Christ, he's the one. Jesus Christ, he's the one. Jesus Christ, he's the son. Jesus Christ, you're the one. Jesus Christ, you're the one. No, you're not the son, but when God came to you, he was the one. Number one in my book, my cousin Mark, he's the man, and when he drives in his car, he does all he can. And when he preaches a word to his disciples, pictures of men, I don't recital, like a recital to my pilgrim when I win, when I join in, you gotta be my friend. Jesus, Jesus, he's our Lord and Savior. All right, Rick, that's a wrap. One love. Tune in to the Freddie and Paul shows. I'll be having 10 tracks on wax pretty soon, and keep it real, game tight, real out of sight. Thanks, Rick.
