 Welcome to the Frady and Paul show. Special guest this week, the magic man, Charles J. Get down with it, we got it in the studio, and you know we get with it. Charles Jennings channel. Charles Jennings channel, that's where you want to get it. Instagram, YouTube. Let's talk a little bit about our team and your studio. Oh yeah, we've been in the studio for like the last three weeks almost. Two weeks. Well two, three, whatever. Stop talking before you think you're right. But yeah, we've been doing that for a little bit. We're trying to come out with some stuff for the fans as well. We have our own song called Christ in Him. I believe it's called Our Lord and Savior. Our Lord and Savior, yeah. The more you guys receive some of the action, you're alive. It's beyond, beyond. What's the name of your YouTube channel, Charles? Mine's the Charles Jennings channel. Charles Jennings channel. There's not really a lot of churchy stuff on my channel, but usually a lot of R&B, pop, hip hop. Me dancing, the Briggs Got Talent auditions, and the voices. I'll put that link in the notes so people can find the channel. There you go. And then what I was going to ask you is remember... You wait for the show to ask me? Is that kind of pressure, you know, from our audience? No, it's not that type of pressure. I am saying that Charles is worried if we use those beats, if they're going to get back at us. We're not going to have... If the beats say they're free, we can use them, right? We're not going to have argument. We're not going to... We're not arguing. We're not arguing. I'm coming to an agreement. I don't see a lot of agreement coming from this conversation right here right now. All right, dude. All right. Okay. What are we going to talk about today? What's up in local sports? These are doing really good. They beat the Blue Jays and the Giants beat the Dunnevats. Okay. And the basketball, Denver is still in it, Utah's still in it, Phoenix is still in it, and the Warriors are out of it for one year. I don't know how the Warriors got out of it, but they're out of it. And hey, Fancy Nancy, how you doing? Fancy Nancy. And Tristan? Do the comment, Fancy Nancy. And Charles? That's Mrs. Claus. I miss Mrs. Claus. I had a rapper when you were on the left, from 102. Oh my God, that was a good one. She was a rapper, and I actually wore a rap board, and she actually did it very perfectly. Really? She was Mrs. Claus, and you're a fan, too. Really? She's been going to get those toys and like... Are there recordings of what you guys did on 102? Yeah, but you know, some of this stuff is like, put them in storage, and we're going to take them out of the box. Heavy duty boombox with the cassette tape. Okay. Also, you kids don't know about that. Y'all just don't know about the past. But I got a rapper in the back, so it'll be okay. Including her, I'm going to be the rapper. That's Mrs. Claus. And Mom, I would like you, one of these Sundays, if we write you some lyrics to do a rap with us and sing a chorus so we can do a song with me, you, and Charles. Oh, no, but we need Philip, too, as Mr. Claus. So when Christmas comes, I think we should have a Christmas celebration at this church. Whoever wants to come to the service, they can come through. We preach, and then we, during praise time, me and Charles and my mom get down and get funky and get down with it. Mrs. Claus get funky. All right. And for the record... We usually have Christmas services, but we never had that aspect of a Christmas service. I think it'd be a fuss. I think it'd be pretty outrageous. You're outrageous, so yeah, we're not really surprised by that. Okay. All right. We got the money vision, the positive vision, and the power structure. And don't forget about Puggy Pug. This Puggy Pug ain't no joke. He's from the P, man. Anyway... He's from my area. Do you know what he's talking about? I don't know what I'm thinking Puggy is. I'm sorry. I don't know either. Okay. I feel better now. I'm lost. This is a good show, man. All right. Can you do some music, Fred? Yeah, I'll do Give Me Jesus. All right. Okay. I don't sing. I excuse myself from the talent portion of the show. During the service, I can hear your voice distinct for me. I'm serious. It sounds good. I think it's because your mic's on. That's the only reason it sounds good. No, you have a good voice. You know how to sing. You were in the choir, right? No, I was in the choir. I was in the choir. We ever sang in the choir. Well, thank you Fred. I appreciate it. It's distinct for you. All I need to do is perform the same thing. I'm going to sing the same thing. I'm going to sing the same thing.
