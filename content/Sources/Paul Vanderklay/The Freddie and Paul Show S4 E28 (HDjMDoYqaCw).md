 I'm sorry. Be right here. Be right here? Yeah. Alright. Here we have a Golden State Advantage card from Alejandro Garcia. For who? California EBT card for Alejandro Garcia. Oh. Right here. This is right over the Freddie and Paul show. Alright. You can come in closer. We're getting our faces. The whole show is in the faces, don't you think? You want to keep this? Yeah. I know you do. Thanks. You're awesome. Anyways, how are you doing today everybody? The A's beat the Giants and then the... Oh! Phoenix is down 3 to 2 now. The Bucks have 3 wins and they have 2. No! 2 wins to 1. So the first person that wins 4 games... Takes the series. ...the second who takes the series. And my team is not in it but that's okay. I still like you Sacramento Kings. Anyways, I'm not on the bandwagon. You're not on the bandwagon? You know what I mean? For the front team, I go for my team win or lose. Win or lose. Because that's how we choose. And it's mostly lose with the Kings. I know, unfortunately. Except back with Bibi and Stryokovic and Dibak. Yeah, the good old days. Doug Christie. Doug Christie. Yeah. The good old days. And what was I going to say? Oh, football's coming soon. Football's coming soon. Maybe we'll add a new component to our show, the Reggie. Even the Garoppolo will be good. Will he be healthy? I'll be healthy at the beginning of the season. If he practices, right? If he practices. He better be training. Garoppolo, you better be training. You have this point, Freddy. Who are the Raiders got for a quarterback? Carr? Yeah, of course. He's good. He's good. Who's their backup quarterback? I don't know. Who's their backup quarterback? Right in there. It's locked. Oh, all unlocked. Oh, thank you. Anyways, back to what I was saying is, I was just saying that... Like I said, three weeks ago we did ten tracks, five songs, and then five more songs. And my boy CJ, his brother, is going to come to church one day. And when he comes to church, I'm going to have him on the program and I'll introduce you. Have a seat. You don't drink soda. Just testing. Anyways, and he will come on the show. He was on my CD, The Massive, with his brother, Charles J. I don't know if you ever met Dion, but he's going to come to church one day, he said. So that's an improvement. I was a disciple in the Lord, having him come to church. And he goes, is it a long church? I said, no. No, we're a short church. In our neighborhood, people like it because we're a short church. Hour, hour and fifteen. We get in, do our business, get out. Not like a lot of church, we're in years for three, four hours. But then you get a meal at the end, otherwise the old people drop. Oh yeah. So, let me think. That's about all on sports. I mean, tennis, that's the only thing I can think of. We never cover tennis. What about golf? We never cover tennis or golf on the show. Oh, I have a question. Okay. Is Tiger Woods still playing golf? I think he's injured. Who about couples? I don't know him. I don't know golf. That's why we never talk about golf on the show. Okay, okay, okay. Although I've been into British soccer lately because of another podcast I listen to. Okay, well I'm going to do my rap now. All right. You know I don't have no lyrics, but I can go ahead from the head. You can go ahead from the head. Because I like to go around the head. I'm going to lead the cue. I present to you, Fast Fred. No. Freddie B. Freddie B. Freddie B. Freddie Biz. Freddie Biz. Take it away, Fred. Rolling deep in my partner six four like this, you know. Like one, two, three. Got it going on, G. One, two. You know it's smooth. I come out like Winnie Poo. I come up and do my thing like who are you? Trying to step to me with that weak old stuff. You better be hard, G. You better kick it and roll to the top. Never going to stop because I'm full of that hip hop rocking nonstop. People living and giving, staying on top of their life. They're living on Freddie Biz from the 916 for Shiggy D. My diggity, what you got going on? Me and Freddie D. not Shaka Khan. Don't you know I'm good to go without a word to say. Rolling on the microphone. I got to keep it really cool. They're going to say, we're letting her. He is my friend. We're going to go to the River Cats. That ain't the end. Yeah, let's do it. That's the end, okay. Where are we going? Where we want to go. All right, let's go. Let's go. Hey, guess what? Trace ball. David. What? I am moving by North Gate. You are? We're going to see a lot. Hi, neighbor. Yeah. We'll be cool. Are we live? Is this thing on? Yeah, it's on. All right. All right. So one love now. All right. Yeah, go ahead, David. Say one love. Oh, David, you got to get him with one love. You got to get him with one love. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. That was good.
