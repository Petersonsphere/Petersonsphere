 One welcome to the Freddie and Paul show. Hi Paul. How's it going Fred? Oh I've been listening to your shows on uh, uh, uh, uh, when you're online and your shows you've been doing and I really dig them and I think they're funky fresh. Thank you Fred. I think it's from the West Coast Mafia. West Coast Mafia, well we got another member of the Dutch Mafia here, the infamous John Mandock. Yep. Up here at Living Stones. Yeah, John's cool. Happy to be here. I like John, he's a really good guy. He uh, well he likes the Dodgers but that's okay. I just said it was the other way around. We just talked about that. Oh, oh, oh, okay. V-A-N-D as in desperately dismal Dodgers. O-N-K. Oh, then you're okay. Desperately dismal Dodgers. That's right. You like the name, right? I'm not sure what teams play in Southern California. I don't keep cracking that. Rams and... On football? And we have the... Chargers. We have the Angels, we have the Angels. We've got baseball and football. So Angels are down there. And Dodgers is baseball. Yeah, Dodgers is baseball. Football is the Rams and the Chargers. Yeah. Our opening is going, our Raiders are going to Vegas, right? They're already in Vegas? Yeah. Wow. So, how about that? That was a big controversy in LA when the Raiders blew us off. Oh. How many teams do you want? Well, I mean, we got to have enough stadiums so that when we all sit six feet apart we can still fill the stadium. Still fill the stadium. Anyway, so what are we talking about today, Fred? I looked online and they're still doing reviews about T. Grizzly. Grizz. Oh yeah? Yeah. He's a rapper, right? Yeah. And you know what I did? Check this out. Okay. I went to his... He had a showing of his music and... Because he did a concert out here. And then before he came on for his interview that he had, there was a few people at 103.5 the bomb. Yeah. And there was about 400, no not 400, but that many at the concert. Okay. But the thing I went to, you know what I was thankful to do? What? I did an opening song, two songs, for him before he came in on his interview. Alright. Good job, Fred. People saw it and it was awesome. Good. Is that your car out there doing? No, that's not John's car. That's a good car. No, that's funky. That's a nice car. Okay, so, Freddy opens for T. Grizz. Yeah. That's cool. And the A's are doing good. A's are doing good. The Giants are doing okay. Giants are doing okay. Football will... September 1st. You think football is going to take off? You think they're going to manage that? A lot of players on a football team. Oh, I forgot about... Hey, fancy Nancy. She was upset that I couldn't do nothing last week. Was she upset? Were you upset, Nancy? We'll let her slide, though. I hope Nancy's watching church because, you know, pastors check and see and make sure the flock are watching. Yeah. And, Mom, well, I'm not going to do a song. You're not going to do a song today? Okay. This is better talking to John. Alright, but what are we going to talk to John about? One more thing. Okay, anybody out there has a Christian home that has a room with a lock on it and everything like that, I need a place to live. It's the adoptive red show. I'm living with five people right now. I'm living with a landlord lady that acts up. She doesn't know what to think and she's not decent in an order. Oh, that's bad. And I want... if anybody... You'd like a house for yourself, preferably. No, I would like... I thought you were moving. I thought I was, but I don't know yet. Oh, it's getting to the end of the month. I know. We'll talk about the rest of this later. Okay. Anyway, we can't let too much out. I have a house in Colorado that I could put you in a room there. You have to move to Colorado. Are you interested in that? I might do it, yeah. Well, you let me know when you get there. But then I got to leave Paul, but... Yeah, we can't do the show anymore. Break up the band. Yeah, can't break up the band. That's not good. Nah. All right, Paul. All right. Is that the way to play? All right. End of the blink. Okay, you got this, John. You go one, love, amen, amen. I never know which way to go with it. I'm dyslexic, so... This is fine. This is fine? Oh, no, you had it right. Yeah. Yeah, you had it right. All right, I'm always going opposite, you know. It's like... No, see? You got it right. Hell. All right. All right. All right. All right, Rick, you're in the cut. Thank you, Rick.
