 Hi, this is Paul. The most recent Jordan Peterson video has dropped and this is a one that I know Jordan was very excited about. He talked about it quite a bit with John Vervecky is the topic of psychedelics, which is a topic that Jordan Peterson gets very excited about and is very anxious to discuss and explore and he's doing so with Karl Ruck and with Brian Murah, Murah Rescue, something like that. Okay, I should probably listen to it and get his name right. Now there are quite a few videos out there with him after the release of his book, The Immortality Key, and so many of you know I actually have two blogs. I have my sub stack where I sort of do summaries of videos and other condensed things and then I have my paulvanderclay.me or leadingchurch.com where I throw it up basically as a link dump and so this morning I just made a compilation of some of the videos that you can find of Brian Murah Rescue. Somebody actually from Grand Rapids has been sending me links to a number of these videos, one with a Jungian psychologist, one with a Harvard academic, Joe Rogan clip is out there right now, the Jordan Peterson one, Chris Williamson had a conversation with him so he's out there, he's doing his thing, he's promoting his book and there you go. I bought one in Kindle and Audible because I'm really quite curious about it. Now every time I get into the psychedelic conversation weird things happen, but fairly predictable things happen. So most of the church people sort of line up and say no, hard no. A lot of the rest of you say oh yeah and then some of the hardcore people are like Vanderclay when are you gonna take it and then because you can't really talk about it unless you know from the inside. Now the interesting thing about Murah Rescue, I should hear how Jordan Peterson says it, anyway the interesting thing about him is that he hasn't done it either and yet he's written this book about it and the book's gonna sell a fair amount of copies and the book's already at least opening up a fair amount of interest in this little corner of the internet and in looking at some of these videos I thought probably the best way to begin to talk about this because I think there's actually a lot of really important things to talk about this subject and as with many things I'm middle of the road. I think they should be studied. I think it is possible that there are pharmacological benefits to this as a culture. We already accept various psychiatric drugs for people and those of you who have watched a number of my videos know that working with people who are, for whom, anti-anxiety meds, anti-depression meds, anti-psychotic meds, mood stabilizers, I work with a lot of people who take these drugs and are prescribed these drugs. These drugs are a big part of our civilization. They're a big part of what goes on. There's a question, should some of these psychedelics be included? But I read Michael Pollan's book on psychedelics. I really enjoyed that book. I found it a very helpful book. He writes as sort of a standard secular materialist or physicalist and we're gonna get into those philosophical categories later. I think these drugs are worth studying. I think this topic is worth exploring but for the reasons I'm going to get to, maybe not even in this video, maybe in subsequent videos, there's a reason why this has a heavy religious component which I think is it's more than fair domain for me to weigh in on and my skepticism revolving around these drugs. Okay? And again, as in so many other issues, I'm right there in the middle and so a bunch of you get frustrated that I don't slam the door with a lot of other religious people and say no, never. Others of you get very frustrated with me because I'm not taking any. I have no plans on taking any and I have zero desire to take any and I'll get into that as we go. But this is for a certain group of people become really a religion and now what's interesting about his book is that his argument is that this is not only a religion but the religion of the ancient Greek world and that is something that is debated to a degree. Well, that gets enough attention but then when he says basically this stands at the heart of Christianity and that original Christianity was actually a psychedelic religion and then mean old church fathers pushed it out of the way. Well, I thought the conversation with the Harvard Academic was quite interesting on some of those notes because the Harvard Academic pushed back on him and I thought some fair ways but I think the best way to get into this is the question of the contemporary religion, quasi religion that is sort of swirling around it for which this book and to a degree I think Jordan Peterson's interest and dare I say perhaps even promotion of these ideas. That's why we have to get into it and I think the best way into it is actually this video from after school which now this channel has treated a fair amount of Jordan Peterson's work and I think well this whoever is doing this channel I don't know who's doing this channel but they're very skillful. They're clear thinkers, they present their material clearly, concisely. I could only hope to be as clear and concise as these people and so I think in many ways this is probably not having yet read the book, okay, so maybe after I take a look at the book I'll feel differently but without looking at the book for me this is the clearest presentation of a particular group who are really jazzed about this book and are really excited about Jordan Peterson's interest and or promotion of these ideas and so I you know I do commentaries on Jordan Peterson's videos on other little videos I don't know how the YouTube algorithm is gonna feel about me doing a commentary on this video on this channel. It's a big channel they've got you know 1.8 million subs I don't you know there's a lot of little things that go into that but I'm gonna try it and see how it goes. In typical PVK long-winded fashion even before I start the video I have to make a comment on the words already. The best kept secret in history, mysterious is a word that plays heavily in this video and heavily in the conversation and it is because I'm a pastor and because I do exegesis on the New Testament and because this is an important word in particular texts including in the Apostle Paul. The word doesn't just mean a cover-up it doesn't just mean a secret and those are those tend to be what sort of grabs this conversation here. Now so if we're gonna speak psychologically one of the self deception to use a vervekey thing one of the silly little tricks that you can play on human beings one of the silly little tricks that you can reliably play on human beings is to announce a cover-up because suddenly if something is concealed we all want to see behind the curtain we all want to see the thing that is being covered we want to know why it's being covered up. Now this in my opinion goes all the way back to the Garden of Eden because that is the trick that the serpent plays on the woman. That tree that's in front of you it's the best tree God is holding out on you he's trying to keep good things from you this is a stupid little human trick that people reliably fall on so the best way to get someone's attention just like that silly old commercial used to say is whisper it's a secret and so again Gnostics I you know even just mentioning the word Gnostic gains attention because Gnostics were big into secret knowledge and this is a reliable this is a reliable trick you can play on human beings I've got something I'm not going to show you then suddenly you know this is these are all these patterns of self-deception that John Vervecky is talking about this is thinking fast and slow this is this is all these stupid brain tricks that reliably work on humans now the best kept secret in history okay there's a value hierarchy and we're putting this way at the top this is the best kept secret in history finally the key the one thing that's gonna make my life great and every advertiser knows this trick so before we even start down this road let's recognize that there's a degree of bullshit or re-involved in the presentation of this okay when you when you pump something up this high call me a little cynical expect that there's gonna be some smuggling and some promotion and some a whole bunch of things all the best kept secret in history okay here we go if you die before you die you won't die when you die that's the now now before we get any further because again by the end of this video the maker of this video seems to forget the main line that this video is actually revolving around if you die before you die you won't die when you die now again someone might listen to this and say boy that sounds a lot like something that Jesus would say yeah it does this is something that as he will say early Christians talked about but when we get to the end of this video in a secular rationalist well he's probably a not not a rationalist physicalist but he definitely this film this this video is definitely framed in physicalism which we will which we will see at the end of it and which is an important part of why this whole important element of why this whole idea right now is really very popular okay it's critical to understanding why this is popular but so don't forget this line and it's gonna be told to us in Greek it's gonna be told and it's in English and it's gonna be told to us and there's gonna be a little bit of a three card Monte shell game that goes on at the end of this video so keep it in your mind now I gotta listen very carefully so maybe I'll listen to how to say Brian's last name if whoever made this video was saying it correctly the key I call it the immortality key it's a big job it's what we're all looking for right maybe he's doing the maybe he's doing the audio for this video all that could be so he didn't say his own name now I'm in trouble now pay attention also here because well none of the symbolism that we see being written before us is incidental or arbitrary all right the prophet of the prophet of the prophet of purpose Jonathan Peugeot could sit down and and look at this and you might say oh look at all the trees of course trees trees connect heaven and earth you know Woden's tree but they have DNA so we already have sort of a sciency ancient modern vibe going on in here we've got two rivers and we're gonna sort of have a tree of life and there we have the yin and the yang and we have this key and this you know shadowed human being the meaning of life what does it mean to be alive now now we've got sort of upside down eyes we've got a little bit of blue that's getting us you know kind of kind of a Hindu vibe psychedelic vibe going on we got this key in the middle and the eyes are upside down but they're definitely looking at us and again we have more genetic double helixes what happens when we die is there a God is there a point to any of this okay so these questions that are being asked right here are fairly standard questions for physicalist culture okay you can say naturalist you can say materialist we're gonna use physicalist perhaps it's the most fair word it's the word that seems to replacing naturalist or materialist so we're gonna use that word well according to the ancient philosophers and mystics there are answers to these questions like real answers real again there's that fudgy word real is a really fudgy word you know he's holding a globe but they're sort of Greek and so yeah I feel a I feel a I feel an evangelistic crusade coming on here these are real answers to the questions that physicalist people in a secular culture have philosophers and mystics there are philosophers and mystics okay so the philosophers the rationalists the mystics so those more the the intuitive people again so so you're casting your net out to a very broad audience philosophers hit the rationalists mystics hit the intuitives you know we can parse this out in a Myers-Briggs sort of way there are answers to these questions like real answers as opposed to they're not hidden away in some book or some dark corner of the internet they're not necessarily hidden away in some book well I don't know books are all over wouldn't you kind of like one in a book but you don't have to work too hard see that's a real piece of this too you don't have to work too hard because a lot of religions basically will say well if you want real answers you have to work for them huh this is America we want a pill don't want to have to work too hard seroling your local church or temple and even if Moses Jesus and the Buddha himself were sitting in your living room they couldn't tell you okay pluralism another big deal in our contemporary culture so we want to answer questions about death because for physical lists death is a real issue okay death is an issue for many cultures but for our culture it's especially a big issue because it's anxiety promoting because the contemporary dominant worldview cannot answer the question about death and so there's just a lot of folk religion that goes out around death and how we have real answers and again when you use this word real and a secular physicalist culture they mean something like sciencey answers and that's a big piece of the popularity of this of this conversation in this part as well now the pluralism Moses Jews Jesus Christians Buddha they'll say can't tell you now what's really interesting is that the premise of this video says this isn't something we can tell or educate you in so sit back for the next 13 minutes and we will tell and educate you about it and it's like wait a minute if you really believe this part right here you should stop right now and just say everybody should say take psychedelics he's not gonna say that because that gets a little you could get a little trouble with YouTube if you start saying LSD and the water supply please now for the sake of the world I'm gonna talk about that a little bit later too so can't tell you oh I have to show you and so right away more little nasty key vibes coming through this video because what's really interesting for a lot of people who say I can't tell you it doesn't mean they stop talking now some people are out there when they say I can't tell you and they stop talking when I see them do that I think oh they really believe they can't tell me so they've stopped talking fair enough but most people when they say I can't tell you and they keep talking you should pause and say wait a minute you just told me you can't tell me why are your lips still moving I have to show you okay are we gonna go someplace you're gonna draw a picture no I want to put something in your body and let's just say well you know people sort of have you know we kind of as human beings kind of like to have an idea of what you're putting in my body is it a vaccine does the Food and Drug Administration say it's okay is it a is it food is it poison and Jordan Peterson talks about that a little bit in this conversation with this guy because it's nothing you can actually learn so end of video no nothing for your rational brain to compute at least oh let's not be rational about it there's sort of a little tricky end around because and again I've had these conversations people and they'd say well you have to stop being rational you just gave me a very rational statement to tell me to stop being rational so if I believe you and if I understand the rationality of your statement then I shouldn't believe it it's another one of those you know what it what did Nick say those those those Godelian cycles like that that phrase that we saw oh yeah the Godelian paradox Godel specifically cites Richard Richard's paradox the liar paradox has semantic analogs of this syntactical syntactical incompleteness result on formal and undecidable propositions in Principia Mathematica and and related systems the liar paradox is the sentence this sentence is false so don't believe reason that's kind of like Steve Jobs when he's up in front of Stanford and says don't believe dogma you just gave us one anyway back to the best-kept secret in history you know my hero the late Joseph Campbell once said it's not the meaning of life that we're after people say that what we're all seeking is a meaning for life I don't think that's what we're really seeking I think he's right right there I you know because and when he's sort of implicit is a meaning though okay something I can put in a sentence and and this is where I think for vacay is you know it's not a propositional what we're really looking for propositional is important we can't live without it we rely upon propositional knowledge for all kinds of things but finally fully propositional knowledge is insufficient for what our heart longs for now some Augustinian roots in me are gonna be coming out as you might imagine I think what we're seeking is an experience of being alive okay yeah slow this down no you're using rationality to say to it's kind of like coming up to someone say give me your wallet like no you're using rationality stop using rationality and give me your wallet oh okay see that's what we really want from people though isn't it and politicians would like it everyone okay maybe I'm a cynic maybe I'm being cynical a lot of what people want from us is hand over the keys of your agency and give your agency to me so I can't I mean how many superhero movies are about are about this they're they're gonna have some machine that somehow hypnotizes humanity and everybody basically does what they want that's this is a this is a big desire that human beings have because for many of us the biggest obstacles in our lives are other human beings and their wills so but but I think Campbell I really love this little quick he makes it he makes a really good point here I think what we're seeking is an experience of being alive now before he finishes this and again I'm not really critical of this thing but okay right now at 1 16 p.m. on July 20 2021 I think I'm having an experience of being alive oh but that's not really what we mean because I'm always having an experience about being of being alive when I'm awake and even when I'm dreaming I'm having an experience of being alive we're getting very Cartesian here but he's gonna say more and it's important but before he said that I wanted to get that in because there's sort of a whoosh about this that on an experience of being alive you mean as opposed to right now because I think I'm experiencing it it's not a very happy time it's little flow ish because I'm making a video but you know not bad but that's not really what he means we're all seeking is a meaning for life I don't think that's what we're really seeking I think what we're seeking is an experience of being alive so that the life experiences that we have on the purely physical plane will have resonances within that are those of our own innermost being okay the life that we're experiencing on the person this physical plane oh yeah are have resonance with life on another plane now this is something I've talked about in a lot of videos because if you want to understand human beings and there's lots of ways of talking about this you can use the book of Ecclesiastes God has put eternity in our hearts well what does he mean by that well it means a lot of something like this that on one hand it's it's the same example as when my I was a I was a seminary student I visited my grandmother my grandfather had already passed away my grandmother was living alone in the retirement home so I would it was right across the street from where I went to school and so I'd visit my grandmother and she was in her late 80s she I think she died in her early 90s and she sat down and she told me my my you know fiance or wife I don't remember when it was she sat down and she said you know you looking at an old lady here yeah grandma that's kind of how I've always known you but inside I feel like I did when I was your age and when you're like in your early 20s it's like but now I'm in my 50s and it's like yeah I know what she means inside part of me feels like I did when I was there and and this gets into this the idea that we live in the age of decay everything around me is decaying aging falling apart dying changing and the Greeks were very much into this but you know the mind the forms you know Platonism CS Lewis who is you know a Platonist in many respects says you know all loves in this world die by death or betrayal but love the idea of love doesn't age and so what he's saying what what Joseph Campbell is saying here is that we want to somehow connect this life down here in the age of decay with a life up in the heavens sort of the way the Bible talks that doesn't decay so for example in the book of Colossians when the Apostle Paul says your life is hidden with Christ in heaven well what does he mean this is a lot of what he means that that our life what do you mean by our life Jesus says if you try to save your life you'll lose it if you lose your life for my sake you'll find it well what does Jesus mean by life suke is what the Greek has what's he saying with that well it's it's kind of similar what Joseph Campbell is is is talking about here that in many ways our lives are split just like my grandmother's life was split on one hand when I was visiting her she was in the last years of her life and she said my body my husband is dead I live in this retirement home I'm I have to deal with my grandmother had arthritis you know she would get up and you know get those knees working and my grandmother was quite a lady but you know inside I'm this young person trapped in an old body inside I have an age and this is where I get into the question of what is your life and in many ways your life is a story because stories don't age and and you can look at let's see if I can actually have any I almost never have much fiction on this shelf here but well here's a story here's a book with a story in it this is Andy Littleton's story the church planter that I had on so Andy Littleton story isn't in this book and it's is it is in this book well it's kind of both ways it's because the story is immaterial the story doesn't decay now you might say well where does the story live well that's a really interesting question it's sort of lives in this book but I could I could throw this book away and it wouldn't harm the story this book sort of participates in the story this book sort of contains part of the story but it's only part of the story because combinatorial explosion the story is far larger than than this book could ever deal with so so again I like this quote from Joseph Campbell he's getting at something that Christianity by no means denies in fact talks about physicalism has a harder time with it but you know when I remember listening to Daniel Dennett on unbelievable say well there's there's there's material and then there's information and I thought game over new atheism is done because once you input once you allow information it's it's all gonna come apart for you sorry anyway back to this good quote and reality is within that are the only physical plane will have resonances within that are those of our own innermost being and reality and so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive right there this is what we want we want rapture and what picture should I pull up is this rapture is this what rapture looks like now this is a guy who lives in the neighborhood who is often just outside my door one of many individuals and this particular day he had a few bottles of something and he drank it and he laid there for about 48 hours he didn't get up to go to the bathroom I knew that because you could see that just went to the bathroom right where he was was this rapture was it numbness was it sleep what are we talking about and this gets into again most of us if we drove by here and we recognize this person as our father or grandfather we'd say well just today in fact on Twitter car drove up to the corner and a young woman got out and she saw me and asked is he there and I said the only way to tell us to walk up and take a look and so I went with her and she was a bit nervous mostly because the lizards were sort of scurrying and I made the point about you know anybody have any idea what these things are here on the wall I know what they are often have to clean them off the wall of the church I know exactly what they are she was dressed too nice to be a social worker she said I'm his granddaughter so we had a little talk it isn't nice to see your grandpa living like this for a long time I didn't know where he was she told me I know some stories from his own lips his wife kicked him out because he was doing drugs and so he's been on he's been here for about two years now and I know him by name we have conversations I often say to him I'm not gonna kick you off the property but I really want something better for you can we find a way for something better oh yeah I'd like that but nothing ever changes doesn't make any efforts and I could call the police and have him evicted but then no anyway that gets into whole other things she agreed with me it isn't nice seeing your grandpa like this but she says you know you can't help nobody who doesn't want to help who doesn't want to change a lot of truth to that he's got hardly any shelter Sacramento temperatures are over a hundred degrees used to have a bike back there but now he has a walker which to me is an indication that as I've I've known many people in my years here life is hard this way you don't last you age much more quickly if you're living like this and basically sort of he just he panhandles finds some money for food probably has an EBT card and uses most of the money that he can for drugs and that's well what's he doing well he's enjoying bliss that's why he does it and I don't know if he had a doctor's appointment or a family thing but this is a lot of what I deal with on a day-to-day basis 1990 Kevin Bacon Julia Roberts William Baldwin Kiefer saw that Sutherland and Oliver Platt and flatliners well what did they do they you know they knew at this point it was had defibrillators and so they would in this movie use a defibrillator to stop the heart so that they would die and then they would resuscitate them so they'd have a near-death experience and now I'm being a little flippant here but the point that they're making here isn't a bad one I have known people who have had near-death experiences and I have known people who have had near-death experiences and those experiences have changed their life I remember when I was a teenager I used to babysit for a woman down the street who had I remember I was going over there because she and her husband were going out and I was gonna babysit and she told me she said I such such thing happened to me and my heart stopped and I was dead on the table for such such amount of time and I was brought back and I had this experience and ever since that time she was a religious person because this question these questions that dog physicalists like what happens after death was answered for her now what's interesting is that the community that's gonna be all excited about this some of the people are gonna be really down for the near-death experience too but when you get to the end of this video the skepticism and the physicalism that the video has within it which is again the prevailing the prevailing dominant religion of Western culture right now will be skeptical about near-death experiences why because it's like there's nothing after death why do they say that that's their dogma their dogma is basically the deductive rational conclusion of their worldview all worldviews have dogma the dogmas are the sometimes inconvenient consequences of a worldview that's what a dogma is so when people like Steve Jobs Stanford don't believe in dogma come on you're BS in me here I know you are don't believe in rationality what was that what was that what was that line I'm gonna have to remember that line this sentence is false so okay but the woman that I babysit for had a near-death experience she died on the table and a whole group of doctors and nurses work their hardest to bring her back flatliners the whole premise of the movie was that these kids played with a defibrillator stopped their heart and then came back as a whole premise of the movie now sort of what we have is what's being promoted is this is a safe way to experience death I kind of experience it every night when I fall asleep that little death that we have it's sometimes called no this is what is this really like death well sometimes it is well it's heaven or hell so it's like okay so this is your argument and again I think this is the clearest most concise unlike this video best argument that I see anybody make but an actual death that feels what do you mean by actual now if you mean by now okay but the insinuation is no it's not actual you're not flatlining these people you are giving them a substance to induce an experience because Joseph Campbell just was talking about experience and now you're talking about death so this is experiencing death and again some of you I know I've had a number of conversations like this some of you are gonna say yeah but you don't understand because you've done it fair enough I'm not doubting anybody's cut take that this was an experience of death and all of the stuff is you're not doubting any of that experience but let me just say it's an experience just like my neighbor who flatlined on an emergency room table cutely and terrifyingly real in this are you is that how you promote this stuff I'm gonna give you this thing and it's gonna be terrifying now some people like terrifying they watch movies in order to be terrified but it's always sort of like okay as long as everybody's wearing white lab coats and that other people say it's okay or if you're part of the community that says no white lab coats they're all liars I prefer someone wearing the garments of the I don't know second millennium BC well fair enough to each his own lifetime how can you know what it means to be alive and again now we're drawing pictures with this here okay and the Prophet of purpose could go through and say blue leaves double helix tree open gates you're you know little hell down below you're you're you're communicating to me I get that and how can you even talk about an afterlife until you've seen it for yourself okay how can you talk about an afterlife until you've seen it but later I later on in the videos say there is no afterlife so so what are you actually talking about and that's what we're going to get into these are the mysteries now in some form or another these mysteries made their way through the high civilizations of antiquity ancient Egypt Mesopotamia the now again I haven't read the book yet I have to explore the premise let me say that it is not I am not at all skeptical of the idea that almost every civilization in the world found to one degree or another mind-altering substances and some of those substances would have been what today we would categorize as psychedelic doesn't surprise me at all I've also said many times people have visions I'm going through the Apostle Paul with my sermons right now people are having visions Apostle Paul had vision Jordan Peterson has visions Barbara Ehrenreich has visions lots and lots and lots of people have visions okay just part of being a human being throughout the ancient world where some of these visions caused or at least contributed by playing around with psychedelic substances absolutely no argument with that assertion seems totally reasonable was this somehow connected with many world religions absolutely makes sense I'm not skeptical about that at all but these world religions also did things like build temples and pyramids and a lot of those kinds of things and well I'm not sure how many people who are sort of living like this are building those kinds of things and I'm sort of giving you a little peek at the secret that is my argument I'm only two minutes into this video in this valley China but it comes to us to Western civilization through the ancient Greeks okay yeah Western civilization the Greeks have a lot to do with it not arguing with you there but the Hebrews too and a big at least again I haven't read his book yet but I suspect a big weakness in this argument is going to be the Hebrews didn't really view intoxication with a lot of moral value many of whom spent a lot of time in North Africa by the way 13 years in the case of Plato the godfather of Western thought so what did we inherit from these high civilizations what are these mysteries like the mysteries of elusus that call to the best and brightest of Athens and Rome it's so funny that something like this is because I don't know if you're along the Greek coast and you find this really hot girl and she takes off her clothes in front of everyone and everyone's looking at her that's not mysterious to me as all the pornography on the internet will will validate my assertion but anyway let's go on including Plato and Marcus Aurelius from about 1500 BC to the fourth century AD and and okay so some of you are gonna say why Paul did you buy this book and this is a great example of why I'm always caught in the middle I'm curious I'm high in openness I'm curious I didn't know a lot about the illusion that the the elucidian mysteries and so I'm looking forward to reading the book and learning some things and now some of you are gonna be like well then at the end of the book then you'll then you'll see it our way I say wait a minute you said this isn't something you could tell me or that I could learn so if I'm gonna take you at your word reading this book shouldn't do it for me they were sacred rituals for turning mortals into immortals sacred rituals for turning mortals into immortals I've heard a lot about that that's all over the world if you if for example you go to get so many pictures I won't pull up pictures a couple of years ago I went with my wife and my youngest son and we visited the cliff dwellers over in Colorado and New Mexico we didn't visit the cliff dwellers we've visited the National Park which had the abandoned remains of the cliff dwellers and so you know you get a chance to look into that and well you know they would put on masks and they would put on these well when they put on their mask they would they would become the God right and again there's lots of ways all around the world where people would become gods there are many transformative rituals experiences religious things whereby people would become gods and in fact one might argue that well gosh what was in that fruit that they're pulling off the tree then you eat it you'll become God well see I just made a I just made a connection and maybe I can write a book that says see the story of the the story of the Garden of Eden is a story about a psychedelic fruit tree only that story didn't end so well well then you'll I mean again and I'm not trying to be flippant here but following the lines of the argument maybe it maybe makes that argument in the book because it seems to me well the day that you eat it you'll surely die oh so you have to die in order to live right but again a physicalist or a modernist or materialist or naturalist says we don't really mean live we mean the first one well kind of metaphorically too because it's taken a second one metaphorically and I would say with all this talk of metaphorical death are you really just sort of playing around with this idea because as a culture we take death pretty seriously as well we should you went to elusus as a human being and you walked away a god okay now again and what do you mean by a god I just read in my Sunday sermon how Herod Agrippa and I read it both in the Luke version and in the version that's in Josephus for those of you who caught the rough draft or even watched the sermon on Sunday Herod Agrippa the first comes out with a as Josephus says a robe that was made up of silver and when he stood in the light he shone and all of his flatterers said it's a god and well we do this today you know you have a fashion model or a really hot girl or or or a dude who were about to have the Olympics and where we're about to enshrine people as gods in the pantheon of Olympic glory we use that language and well what do you mean you come out a god because there's a lot of there's a lot of fudgery in the language of this video too you come out of God okay well what do you mean you mean like a demigod like a superhuman like Achilles like Hercules like like and CS Lewis plays with these words and you know CS Lewis basically says you know the transformation that that that the Holy Spirit is is is already proceeding in us will turn us someday into the kind of being that we today might be tempted to worship to see us Lewis says in mere Christianity so how did that happen through this well I don't know maybe if I you know maybe if I would get hair plugs and like take better care of myself and have skin treatments and go to the gym a lot and you know and come out and oh god what do you mean again we use this language but there's a lot of fudgery in this video ceremonial experience of death and rebirth and whenever they say that again the videos like but read Romans 6 that's baptism so you're united with Christ you reunited with Christ's death in your baptism and you're raised with Christ in baptism to new life now someone might make the argument well baptism you're not really supposed to swallow the water but I guess you could make an argument that there's like spores in the water and so no I would say baptism is a ceremonial washing and there's sort of dual understanding of it it's it's it's washing away of our sins and that's also I'd say a ceremonial ordeal a water ordeal and if you followed my sermons that I pay a lot of attention to the ordeals in the Bible a lot of them are in the book of Daniel and there's a lot of visions in the book of Daniel are you saying that the visions in the book of Daniel because Revelation always gets noted but the visions of the book of Daniel are psychedelic trips now I can't say that Daniel didn't eat or drink something in Babylon although if we're gonna take chapter one seriously he sort of wanted water and fruits and which would sort of mitigate against the psychedelic argument for Daniel but anyway baptism is an ordeal of of death and rebirth let's be very clear elusus and the other mystery cults of the time were the real religion of the ancient Greeks there's that fudgy real word again now this part of the video let's just play a little bit first the people who built Western civilization democracy listen to Tom Holland about what democracy meant in Athens these are the people that built Western civilization are you going to blame American slavery on these people too because again read Tom Holland about the moral ethics of these cultures I mean there's a lot of fudgery in here the arts and sciences the theater that became our Hollywood the Olympic Games that became our sports industry the open marketplace of ideas that we take for granted every day on social media so we're gonna blame them for social media and you know fair enough that we certainly derive some of our values from this world but again you got to read Tom Holland on this because Tom Holland first fell in love with this world and was excited about this world and then so became a historian and a writer and the more he read the more he thought these people are not like us and and read read Tom Holland's books about Athens and about you know this is a very strange world but now the deeper contention he's saying is this is the real religion of these people okay so now we can begin to ask the question all right if this is the best kept secret in history if taking these substances affords this experience that is utterly transformative in people's lives then what would our expectation be of what this religion would produce in these people's lives would this produce with this would taking these substances and slavery no would it end war no would it end infanticide no would it end Pederesty no would it end all of the things that we look back is a really selective view of this because does anybody around here really want to simply go back to the way they lived and the way they fought and little spoiler alert the Greeks lost they lost to Rome and so let's tamp down our expectations on what this mystery is going to yield to us because some other worldview won and that worldview had a morality that is a whole lot closer to the present morality and I would argue eschatology a whole lot closer to the eschatology promoted by Athens or Sparta or Corinth or Macedon or Rome than we have today okay so I appreciate but again there's a lot of fudgery in this video didn't you ever wonder how the people who invented all this and the very word for skepticism could somehow believe in a bunch of fairy tales now that you just you just said Joseph Campbell was like your dude and then you give us this line I mean have you learned nothing from Jordan Peterson and yeah if you read Plato well where does Plato's Republic start well Socrates is down at the port well what he's what is he doing he's watching a procession to a god and there are the gods and they've got a degree of skepticism about the gods but you know hey what about stoicism was stoicism not the real religion of their day what about epicureanism was that not the real religion of their day so I'm not arguing that these mystery cults weren't really important but to sort of play it off it's a huge anachronism that that was the real religion of the day oh you mean like Christianity was in the 15th century in Europe no there's way too much fudginess underfoot here did they really think Zeus was perched on some mountaintop hurling I'm sure some of them did in fact if we have sort of the anachronistic ideology stories well that's isn't that where thunder comes from right did they who's they all of them or was it the common people believed in the gods and it's only the real eggheads like Plato and Socrates now not many of them around in the population they were skeptical about it and these were some of the people who wrote but the regular people they went to the temples and they enjoyed the you know later in Rome the bread and circuses thunderbolts down to us hapless humans our Poseidon was in the middle of the sea patrolling the wind and waves with a frickin Trident come on man take the sea patrolling the wind and waves with a frickin Trident come on man fudge take Cicero the great Roman statesman of the first century BC who all the Stoics claim and a lot of the Stoics would be a little you know the rationalist Stoics maybe that's all these rationalists out there oh boy he called a leucis the most exceptional and divine thing Athens ever produced and again I'm gonna read the book because I'm really curious about these questions but don't present it as this was the main religion in Athens for the whole classical period like Roman Catholicism was the religion in Europe in the 15th century I'm more than a little skeptical of a claim like that not democracy and free speech and all the rest of it a leucis was the thing well yeah he was a Roman democracy in Rome you know who paid taxes in the Roman Empire everyone but the Romans you have the conquered people that pay taxes and so okay what are you selling us here thing we could never forget it was said to hold the entire species together and again I'm very curious about these statements and so I'm gonna look into them I'm excited to do the research why because you went to its sacred temple to experience nothing less than death and rebirth and okay fair enough they're arguing that they had a psychological they had a that a psychedelic experience and they experienced death and rebirth and rebirth and this changed the individual people so that what they all were happy so that they didn't divorce so that they didn't have sex with boys so that they didn't enslave the people that they conquered so that they know to my reading they did all these things and going to this temple you know after they left the temple they thought oh slavery what a bad idea I shouldn't have slave with the I shouldn't have sex with the slave girls anymore I is that what is that what they found I look forward to reading that in the book that they came out of the temple and suddenly they were moralists in the shape of the 20th or 21st century I don't think he's gonna argue that well maybe they're not afraid of death anymore well there you go but they certainly kept threatening death on each other and their enemies and followed through because basically when you conquered a city I mean the Romans knew and the Greeks knew how to conquer how to rape how to pillage how to do all these things that a whole other side of our culture is now divorcing us from the ancient world and saying we're not like them because well we're gonna have to take down the statues there's just listening to the rest of history about statues and Trafalgar swear we're gonna have to take statues down of all these generals that basically put down the Indian uprising and you know we've had a couple of decades now of people saying Christianity is bunk because it leads to imperial militarism well if there's anything that a leucis didn't do it's addressed the imperial militarism of the ancient world all right so you're painting an awful pretty picture of us here of this here but you're asking that I forget everything else that we're talking about in our culture oh you mean I should just assume all of this Christian morality and then add this little bit on top and only those who had made the long march from Athens to the torch lit sanctuary drunk a magic potion and witnessed the blessed sight and vision as Plato called it were said to conquer death well let's talk about Plato a little bit let's have the gold and the silver and the bronze and let's let's look at Plato's ideal society which you know if you want to get a sense of what the kiosk una is from the inside that thing that wells up and makes us just well we have to blow up her person into a society just read Plato's Republic once he went from elucis then he democracy played who was not down with democracy at all now again I think Plato's awesome I like Plato I like Socrates I like Aristotle all that stuff is fun but let's measure our expectations here shall we did Plato believe in life after death well now we can have a big discussion about Plato middle Platonism neo Platonism Platonism as it got wedded with Christianity neo Platonism has got wedded with Christianity via Augustine Aristotelian ism wedded with Christianity via Aquinas by experiencing just a taste of immortality that rapture of being alive oh there we are and and you know and I you know hey churches guilty as charged how many praise songs do you see somebody standing on the edge of a beautiful scene in a cliff with arms outspread and usually not with the double helix tree and some upside down Hindu God looking backwards at you but hey Joseph Campbell's right what a lot of what we want is an experience of rapture but then we're sort of stuck with Dan Fogelberg's song how can we make love stay how can we make rapture stay because at that point now you're going to get into the question of what do you do in the times that you're not rapturous what do you do in the times when you're going shopping for the family or going work to put food going to work to put food on the table or or trying to create a civilization or a better society where people's medical needs are cared for and and to somehow figure out what to do with this incredible difficult puzzle of homelessness and addiction and so if we put LSD in the water then suddenly what pick your you know pick your political utopia you know your your woke Republic is going to emerge or your your your purely capitalist Ayn Rand Republic is going to emerge I don't think that's what's gonna happen if everybody has this experience of death maybe they'll just say it doesn't matter if you think about it that's more science than religion once you've seen God what there's no unseeing God what do you mean by God once you've seen death are you saying death is God is this a Shiva thing because you just said you experience death and rebirth and now you're saying that's seeing God okay if that well just as long as I'm clear on the definition you've proven the hypothesis for yourself so what I've proven the hypotel now it's science and math we're doing okay the hell was going on frankly that's what I'd like to know no it was all secret to reveal what you saw in the lucis was to risk execution now there's a little bit of duplicity here too because on one hand and I take people very much at that word when they say I cannot describe exactly what it is that I saw so people will say and I believe them completely I cannot what I experienced with that psychedelic was ineffable I can't put it into words I believe you 100% whether or not the Apostle Paul and now I'm gonna get in trouble the other side whether or not the Apostle Paul had intentionally or unintentionally ingested something well he was on the road to Damascus I really doubt that he was intentionally dosing up with with with some beer or wine when he was trying to make his way to Damascus to persecute people who believe that Jesus resurrection really happened he says I cannot describe what I saw I completely believe you but to try to describe it as a crime is this this was this a religious totalitarian state you know again I think there's a little bit of fudging going on through here which is why Houston Smith perhaps the most influential religious scholar of the 20th century called it that's because he wrote all those textbooks the best kept secret in history like other rites of passage yeah the art the the art communicates here too was thought some archaic techniques of ecstasy were to blame for that famous vision at Eleusis the same techniques employed since time now wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute ecstasy or death I mean if death is ecstasy but you know I've read enough about listened enough about psychedelic experiences sometimes they're good sometimes they're bad sometimes they're good and bad so okay I'm in memorial in tribal initiation rights or admission to a secret society to create that near death experience okay now but you again this is ineffable and you're also calling it a near-death experience and you're also calling it ecstasy so okay like fasting and sleep deprivation so in other words you can do it besides blunt forcing the chemical matrix of your brain to induce this experience you can do this through years of meditation through breathing exercises through let's say a smoke machine and a great band and a skinny jean worship leader in your evangelical church because I know you can because I've been there too but that's not the same I completely believe it's not exactly the same because you know even if I'm really enjoying a particular song as I'm driving in my car I'm still able to drive my car and nobody I know tries doing psychedelics behind the wheel definitely get the job done but there was another possibility remember that magic potion in Greek it was called the Koukion a kind of primitive beer but it wasn't the only magic potion splashing around the Mediterranean Dionysus the Greek god of ecstasy and madness he had a potion too to drink his holy wine was to drink the blood of the god now again I'm not skeptical about any of this stuff and I'm really looking forward to reading the book about because there's a lot in the book about beer and wine it's what a lot of the reviews have said and so I'm gonna check it out and I'm absolutely non skeptical about both the fact that there would have been what we might consider contaminants in ancient drinks that would have induced psychedelic states and people and that this would have been intentionally part of many religious experiences the fact that these continue I mean part of what happened in the Columbian exchange when 15th century people 16th century people began to explore the Americas where their civilization in many ways were was thousands of years earlier in terms of a developmental curve that they found alwaska and all sorts of other things going on again I'm not skeptical about this at all and that it would be called the blood of the gods makes perfect sense because once you start using the God word the God word is sort of like a circuit breaker once you got a certain amount of voltage going through the line bang you start saying God that's part of how that word works in fact you were drinking the God to become the God this is where we get the whole like and again same thing to become the God or what do you mean by that well it's kind of like blowing the circuit breaker you know just something happened something happened something happens God that's and that's how the world the word works for many human societies idea of enthusiasm from the Greek word and the essence of the God lives within you and that's right verveki keeps making that point again and again you have become divine so what kind of beer and wine was this but now let's watch the anachronisms a little bit here because of after in Western civilization deeply influenced by Christianity whenever you were use that word divine in this sense you are pulling on very rigid very structured Christian division between the God and everything else because the creator creature distinction in Christianity is a real fixed line and for that reason in this culture you use that word divine or God everybody sort of catches their breath because of the deep influence of Christianity in this culture I suspect if you're an ancient it's another God that's divine you're divine I'm divine he's divine gots a little bit of divinity and my trackball here we're just we're just washing all over the place in the divine but there's no catch because you don't have thousands of years of Christian influence in the culture now it's got cache a it's got sizzle because well because in Christianity well the the God of Christianity and Islam and Judaism is powerful and and and here and powerful and you know if you're in a place where everything's just a wash in the divine it's like oh there's some divinity just went down the road and well there's some divinity passed out on my doorstep to my church and some divinity took a poop against the wall back there and I guess there's some divinity in the poop he let the poop stain too is the divinity all over the place in 1978 at the height of the war on drugs a controversial theory clean now we're gonna get into okay big bad evil man tried to keep us from getting now we're back sorted to the Garden of Eden in these magic potions must have been some crazy psychedelic concoction beer and wine spiked with mind-altering drugs now no to been some crazy psychedelic concoction beer I think those pants are a psychic psychedelic concoction I probably used to have a pair of pants like that I'm old enough to remember the 70s baby wine spiked with mind-altering drugs and and you know I don't think the sales job helps when you show the hippies because the whole hippie thing not a pleasant experience for a lot of the children who were neglected because mom and dad needed to just chase their divinities okay because what a lot of those kids really wanted was maybe milk in the fridge in a reliable basis and someone to pay attention to them maybe that was the best-kept secret behind the vision at a loose is that lasted for 2,000 years maybe that fueled the wild parties of Dionysus I don't know again I don't know that you need a psychedelic to have a party like this I mean just regular old wine and beer would do it don't you think at least that's my understanding this is in the mountains and forests from Spain to Italy to Greece to the Holy Land giving birth to our poetry and music our comedy and tragedy you know yeah a lot of broad brushing here either way the psychedelic theory was the wrong idea at the wrong time with no hard scientific data to support it now why and again I think what's really cool about this book is now by virtue of the science that we have and our archaeology has continued to push into the ancient world and history I think he's got a legit again he himself is not a psychedelic user and so in terms of the question itself in an academic way I'm down I want to know I I I cheer this project but a lot of the religious fudginess that's being promoted by this it's like whoa it is any of this matter because at the time there was another healer who was into the mysteries and he had a magic potion and now we're sort of like we've got mysteries here and we got mysteries there we got divinity here and we got divinity in the poop stain and it made you immortal too and he told weird stories that were and again I I think this is a valid thesis to explore and I'm looking forward to reading his argument recorded in ancient Greek the same ancient Greek that was okay little bit slight a hand there it's recorded in ancient Greek well that's right the canonical New Testament books we have are in fact in Koine Greek did Jesus speak these words in Greek now I've just stepped into a world of swirl of New Testament studies most would argue that the position was nah he spoke of an Aramaic okay was this a thing in the Jewish community because in New Testament studies a New Testament studies the theological biblical studies all have fashions and the hot spot right now for New Testament studies is understanding Jesus and the New Testament in the second temple Jewish context and basically what he's saying is forget the Jewish context it's the psychedelic rave party and it's like color me skeptical spoken by Plato and the initiates of the Greek mysteries and when this healer was asked why he told such weird stories or power so in other words and you know I don't want to be too flippant here because again it was Dallas Willard who in the divine conspiracy when he says Jesus is engaging the question of the kind of Sun a sort of like Plato is in his Republic in the in the Sermon on the Mount okay and certainly as and again if you're following my Sunday sermons I'm really working hard this idea is the Apostle Paul is a bridge but to sort of cast Jesus as a psychedelic promoter in second temple Judaism again color me skeptical because in terms of New Testament studies we've gotten a lot of payout from understanding Jesus as a Jew not Jesus as some Greek mystic who was slipping the Mickey and you know the loaves and fishes he was distributing on the Jewish hillside he said well I'm talking about musteria here and he uses that word in Greek mystery now it's also important to remember that these Gospels are targeted okay the Gospel of John written by depends where you want to sland on sort of the critical thing written by John of James and John John the disciple of Jesus or written by another John or written by someone in the joining community reflecting the teaching of John who would settle down in Ephesus the Gospel of John has a lot of hebraisms in it but the Gospel of John also written to a Roman context and a an Eastern Roman Empire context the Gospel of John you know look at look at st. Elijah's Orthodox in Kansas City has a really cool series on the Gospel of John but this is the kind of mysteries that they're talking about it's like again if you say it in Greek it's all fancy but again color me skeptical I'm not gonna share the damn secret with just anybody he says but I'll tell you what I'm here to give sight to the blind now again there's there's a lot going on in this but let's just zoom into let's say Matthew 13 where Jesus I speak in parables so that you know and just read Matthew 13 and then his disciples are like well tell us it's straight and then he does Jesus doesn't pause and say I'm giving out mysteries saying these words and the disciples say we'd like to see the mystery and Jesus says eat this or drink this it's not what happens so again and and what's interesting in some of the articles there's a real question how far he pushes his thesis in some of these interviews and especially with that interview with the Harvard scholar he really sort of backpedaled as long as you die for it you must be born again before you can see God's kingdom he says born from above and he's talking to Nicodemus so is he telling Nicodemus Nicodemus needs to do psychedelics why doesn't he tell that to the woman at the well they're not drinking beer or wine at the well he wants water and he's gonna give them living water now again I'm not completely dismissive of some aspects of this argument and I want to read the book but there's a lot of fudginess that a lot of people who don't know much about this will sort of sort of glide over and say aha now what's the attraction in this the attraction in our world would be something like the video I just released today you mean I don't have to hate gays and vote Republican and be against abortion to be like Jesus I just have to take some laced wine or beer I don't have to go to church I don't have to memorize Bible services I don't have to sit in church and listen some Protestant drone on or I don't have to go to an Orthodox church and and look at the pretty pictures on the wall and and try and figure out how to say the whole liturgy and and maybe if I find the right Catholic church they'll put a little they'll put some spores in the bread and then they'll lace the wine and they'll take the wine and I'll lay back on the floor and yeah but really what about first Corinthians 11 because what Paul basically says is I don't know you're having your love feast there and the rich and the powerful of Corinth are eating and drinking having a good time and the poor are left out now if you sort of imagine very early church Eucharist celebrations in a first Corinthian sort of way and it would seem to me that the first Corinthians would be down for all this because they were the ones who are really excited about spiritual visions and things I don't know how the Judaizers would fare in this conversation but it seems the apostle Paul who again as he says to the first Corinthians as I read in a couple sermons ago and in second Corinthians 10 and following says I've had better visions than all of y'all but you know what as he said in first Corinthians 11 what you're doing with your love feast which kind of looks like the little pictures that he paints here I'd I'd rather you stop now if drinking the magic drink the magic potion somehow really afforded the payout that it does why would the apostle Paul ask them to stop if that's in fact what they were doing because maybe the apostle Paul very much in alignment with the Hebrew prophets would have said it's not ecstatic experiences I'm looking for from you it's obedience it's how you treat your neighbor it's how you treat the poor it's how it plays out I mean you can lay in the back of the churchyard putting poop stains on the wall and your ecstatic experiences with all kinds of street drugs but that wasn't quite the new life that Jesus had in mind it's not even so much the new life that this individual's granddaughter would like to see for her grandfather and you would say well psychedelics aren't addictive yeah I get that but what are you telling me it's certainly not having this one experience and my my question would be how does this transformative experience actually pay out in your life that's the question I want to ask and how does it scale up in terms of community and how does it scale up in terms of loving your neighbor as yourself that's what I have to ask and once you do that I tell you for certain in Greek he says amen amen like for real for real that you will see heaven open and God's angels going up and down in Greek this healer was Jesus we call him Jesus and just like Dionysus he was the son of God born of a virgin who took on human flesh to leave us a gift and yeah and we can look at Matthew 11 and notice that he sort of disappointed the people because to some he didn't fast enough or prescribe prescribed fasting or hand washing sufficiently to satisfy some groups and they called him a glutton and other groups he wasn't he wasn't celeb he wasn't celebratory enough and they called him a faster in other words he didn't make anyone happy and so the idea of kind of hippie Jesus who's well I don't know why would he come to earth at all and why not just stay in heaven and can continue to enjoy the trippy life that is this image of heaven oh but we haven't got to the end of the video there's no heaven the gift of holy wine his blood that turns humans into gods now again is that really the language that the new testament uses will become children of God by adoption but it's not really even in the ancient Greece what they would imagine a god to be does it turn people who drink this become alexander the great they become hercules they become achille they become aphrodite that doesn't seem to hold at all with the rest of what we read in the new testament where paul on one hand talks and again we're going to get to this as we go deeper and deeper into paul on one hand paul talks about being clothed with new life on the other hand it i don't think they're going to be along they're going to continue to have sort of a jewish sexuality and a jewish sobriety and however you feel about the authorship of of titus or or timothy what's amazing when paul says you know who do we want as leaders in these churches that i'm planting they're really shopkeeper ethos they're people who are reliable and it's not people who i want someone who can take some lsd that would down a horse that's not the kind of people that he's picking but unlike dianysus yesus found it the biggest religion the world has ever known why what did jesus add that completely trounced dianysus today it's two and a half billion people like a third of the planet and all of that with 1900 years of repression against what you imagine started at the beginning so where's the real success story here and if the earliest christians knew how to brew up a psychedelic beer or mix up a psychedelic wine and those magic potions were a direct path to die before you die then why when it was suppressed in the second or third or fourth century after that did it really grow i mean the argument undercuts itself and so jordan peterson starts talking to this guy and he's like you know jordan peterson's looking for something to revive christianity well you might not want to look at this because i don't know read first corinthians because if lacing everybody's communion wine with lsd kind of results in the eucharist that we find described in first corinthians 11 the apostle paul wasn't down with it and he had better visions than any of them that's the point of second corinthians 10 11 and 12 to have that vision of the kingdom of heaven and the best kept secret of christianity is the same as the best kept secret of the ancient greece that preceded it really really then it would rewrite the entire history of western civilization yeah it would because we you know especially after constantin i got a fair amount of knowledge about what was going on in churches and you know what it didn't seem to look like this it didn't look like um i always want to say dianisio because that was a name common name in the dominican republic and in fact one of the guys who worked in our office was dianisio so you know your second language or the in terms of the tier the second language seems to corrupt all the other languages going on down now the real question is what does this all mean for us today how do we that's the real question that's the third significant use of real in this video i count die before we die in the 21st century now we're gonna apply it to physicalists there's no one answer of course but in our leading metal science now we're back to lab coats white lab coats and the people who produce vaccines and antibiotics and have hospitals and science medical schools psychedelics are proving to be a safe and reliable means of producing that death and rebirth experience of the ancient mysteries now okay in other words having some i don't know 400 some chemist 400 years before christ certainly glad we have it today where we can purify these compounds are they the same compounds we don't know we're figuring that out and again i i'd like to know and again if if there are if there are therapeutic applications for this but there's a real sense that and and this is something i'm going to want to get into a little bit probably not in this video so michael best to find it rather than get it wrong so i haven't been listening to joe rogan since he's been on spotify because it's just inconvenient and michael potluck michael palm learned from quitting caffeine for three months that was a very interesting video and part of what was interesting video about it was he well maybe i'll play a little bit of it now let's just talk about caffeine a drug we use well and this is where things are going to get funky because everything we eat or drink becomes part of our story and part of our story in interesting ways so what would they they had never experienced coffee before the 1600s that's right they had in the arab world they had they'd had it from like 1200 or something like that supposedly it was discovered in 800s by a herder in like ethiopia who noticed that his goats were getting very frisky when they ate this particular berry and would stay up all night and so he yeah so he kind of like started experimenting or he brought it to these monks and they made a drink and it's like it makes oh those monks sense that uh it was in the arab world because if you think about all the science that was being done in the arab world all the literature back then so one theory is that the arab world had coffee first and had this incredible golden age yes so coffee gave us math and again i'm not skeptical but my point in all of this is that the foods we eat and drink and the ways that they affect us and again we've i mean we're my goodness we're in the age right now of taking a very careful look about what we eat and drink we got jordan peterson eating nothing but beef and water we've got people with paleo diets we've got intermittent fasting we've got the stuff we put in our mouth impacts us and scales up into society and there is an historian of psychoactives named wolfgang schivelbusch and he has a great name isn't that wonderful german of course wolfgang schivelbusch it's a great book it's called tastes of paradise highly recommend it so what is it the psychedelics or is it caffeine um and he said this was the perfect drug for the culture that invented mathematics and had this incredible um and it helped the culture in two ways one was as safe as alcohol made water boiling it made it much safer and coffee and tea of course both require boiling water no one ate drank boiling water uh or hot beverages before so this gave this incredible public health boost to these places and then you have the drug that basically fosters a kind of more linear rational focused way of thinking oh drug matchup we've got caffeine rationality and psychedelics irrationality steel cage match for human spirituality oh they're gonna meme the heck out of that one i've never done them myself psychedelics are absolutely not for everybody hey wait a minute this is the key to eternal life and you're gonna withhold it from some people witch people they are powerful and unpredictable and need to be approached with caution and reverence but under the right conditions science and with the right preparation science there are genuine mystical reports wait a minute i see people doing that all the time outside my front door over the past 20 years almost 75 percent of the volunteers at johns hawkins and nyu who've taken just one dose of psilocybin the active compound in magic mushrooms will rank it among the most meaningful experiences of their lives again i'm not a skeptic i'm not saying this they shouldn't be studying this i'm not saying we shouldn't have this conversation i'm just saying i'm going to be watching the fudge so as these compounds become legal in the coming years it begs a big question yeah there's a lot of begging the question in this video have the mysteries returned well some of these clinical volunteers say their psilocybin journey is like a mini death on itself a foreshadowing of what awaits them at the end of life so again back to the near-death experience thing here um and how would you know that this is a death if you haven't experienced death and it's sort of like cs louis talking to the little boy and you know little boy doesn't know what sex is like because he's not growing up in ancient greece and the kid's like will there be chocolate and louis is like oh i guess you could add chocolate if you want to but i tend to think when you get there chocolate won't be really what's on your mind might be what's on hers and just like the initiates of the mysteries of elusus or the mysteries of dynasis or the earliest christians 2000 years ago by pre yeah but i don't think i don't think jonathan peugeot draws pictures like this he must be one of those evil guys like richard nixon and ronald reagan be experiencing their death they found the immortality key well uh again roman 6 they've rediscovered that ancient principle the only way to experience god is to let oh whoa whoa whoa whoa the only way to experience god again circuit breaker bang god go the rational mind well i guess we're giving up on caffeine then and when the ego gives up your consciousness begins to expand beyond the body when the ego gives up your consciousness begins to expand beyond the body yeah i understand what you're saying and you know it's always when people tell me that they're denying their ego i usually ask for things like the d to their house and suddenly the ego reemerges beyond space and time beyond the very categories of being and non-being to and and again d to your house please thank you if you'd really like to being a non-being i'd like the d to your house and your car and your 403 b because mine's a little small and i don't know seeing this very i i'm is it egoic it might be a little erotic find itself looking back at itself well there's your new definition of god i wasn't looking for a new definition of god and i'm not sure that's a really good one st joseph campbell oh okay sorry but you're quoting him but the ultimate unqualified mystery is beyond human experience okay becomes inflected as they say there is a condescension on the part of the infinite to the mind of man well yeah john calvin called it accommodation and then that is what looks like god looks like god what did that woman flying up like this look like god i guess she's in the image of god but again there's just a lot of fudgyness going on here and again i think for a lot of people god is sort of when the circuit breaker trips once you put enough stuff through but again this is leveraging 2000 years of christian influence where you have a god which is big and powerful and there's a really hard creator creature distinction and there's almighty and lord of hosts and all of that thing suddenly saying this name gets cachet as opposed to a culture in which we're just swimming in divinity this business of understanding the relationship of mortality to something in you that is transcendent of more talent whoa you're gonna you're you're now the physicalists are now the physicalists are getting a little worried about the woo but if you don't die now you might never experience that ultimate mystery of being oh don't worry i can very much promise you you are going to die eventually okay and you're going to experience it hopefully if it's like not in a an instantaneous way so no but so what you really want to do is have experienced death okay are we back to flatliners as the mystery of your being that to know yourself at the deepest level is really to know god fudge fudge fudge fudge i mean we don't have a word for it but we call oh we got a lot of words for it god this divine again the circuit breaker mine spark that lives in you is really that's what we call god because this dude went this dude was taught by the jesuits now i've been reading about the jesuits in my book reformations and those jesuits i know one particular jesuit that a lot of people are not particularly happy with now because i think that latin mass sort of was a pretty transcendent thing for a lot of people and you might never understand that heaven is you're gonna have to get this experience before you really have the experience it's sort of a it's sort of a bucket list here right that's the argument not what happens when the physical body wastes away whoa whoa wait a minute wait then why are you using the word death because now you just sort of undermine the whole argument you are making in this video and you might never understand that heaven is not what happens when the physical body wastes away there's an assertion i hope the jesuits didn't teach you that because maybe jordan peterson asks well you getting in trouble with any of these christian people i don't know we'll see if he sees this video and again i'm not i'm not his enemy i'm not against studying this i'm i bought the book i bought the audiobook i'm gonna check it out i'm i'm really curious i'm really curious about the ancient argument but when you lay down something like this it's like oh that's right you're a physicalist because unlike let's say the ancients that probably imagined at least some of them imagined there was something after after life maybe all of those people that you're skeptical that they really believed in zeus and pesidon and all of that it's like did you ever watch vikings on tv even the writers of that show imagined that vikings actually really believed in thor and so i would say that a lot of greeks really believed in zeus and there is no afterlife that's just an assertion because there is no after there's only right here right now there's another physicalist assertion the kingdom of the father is spread upon the earth says the gospel of thomas oooooooooooooooooooooooooo you know if you really don't want to be tagged agnostic don't quote from agnostic gospel i am so bad in this video and people do not see it for the ancient philosophers and mystics it was never about living forever within the field of time there's a big assertion is that jesus in that picture like the one with the with kind of the suspenders and or the one with they didn't wear clothes like that. Now what has sort of happened? Well now we've addressed pluralism. Now in fact we have the one religious key to make sense of it all which isn't what we're looking for. We want to deal with pluralism. We want to deal with life after death but we don't want to leave our physicalism. We don't want to leave. We don't want to wander off and to say something in public that would you know cause embarrassment like I don't know I'm still waiting for Jesus second coming and I hope he brings heaven with him and the renewal of all things. Call me a fundamentalist but there I am. Just going on and on until the stars fade. Oh so now we're on to the good life. And the cosmos goes dark. Oh so now we're adding heat death of the universe. Now where's Lawrence Krauss? He should be in this somewhere. It was never about life after death. It was never about life after death? Well gosh when Jesus you know I think I think Peter and Paul and them believed Jesus walked out of the grave and when he ascended into heaven and when the angel said to Peter he's coming back in the same way and the church has sort of kept up this idea I don't think you're I know that there are Christians who will say this but I don't believe you. I don't believe you. I don't believe this. You've sort of recast Jesus because you've scraped some stuff out of goblets from the ancient world. Again call me skeptical. It was always about venturing into the time. It was always about recon. Is that what it's called? No it's not. What is that called? Retcon in a film television series or other fictional work. How about in a religion? A piece of new information that imposes a different interpretation on previously described events typically used to facilitate a dramatic plot shift or account for inconsistency. This is the psychedelic retcon. I might have a title for this video. Timelessness of the infinite present to realize your own divinity. See again point I just made if you say this word after your culture has been radically shifted by the creator creature distinction that word has punch. Did it really have so much punch in the ancient world? This is a this is a giant attempt at a retcon. And the divinity of everyone and everything around you. Is that what the Greeks thought? Did the Greeks really think that? Did going to this temple make all of the Greeks? Wow I look at the divinity in my slave boy. Let me have sex with him. I don't think so. Which is love in its purest form. I don't think they even called it love when they did that to their slaves. They were just taking care of business. Maybe that's what it means to be fully alive and maybe that's what ancient sacraments were for like holy beer and holy wine. But again it didn't play out in the purest form of love to their slaves. Christianity brought that. And again precisely what the Apostle Paul addresses in 1st Corinthians 11 is that point. To help us glimpse that perfect love and perfect peace. Maybe what we're seeing now is a modern-day sacrament. What do you mean by sacrament? Because in a in a physicalist world I don't think you can have one. During her psilocybin session one of the volunteers Dinah Bazer a self-described atheist had the overwhelming feeling of being bathed in God's love. Now what kind of an atheist would say something like that? Well the kind of the vision here is well we can divide we can we can transcend the atheist theist divide. So just and you know you see them with Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris. Jordan Peterson's like take a higher dose and Sam Harris has said I've taken plenty and Jordan Peterson's like not enough to stop you from being an atheist and I think I'm not interested in that fight. And the sudden epiphany that every moment is an eternity of its own. Now you don't really need to do a psychedelic to do that. I spent two hours in the DMV this week and I had a lot of moments that felt like eternities. Sounds awfully familiar. Me too. Eternity isn't some later time. Eternity isn't a long time. Eternity has nothing to do with time. Eternity is that dimension of here and now which thinking and time cuts out. Sort of like my grandma's talk. You know outside you see this old lady but inside time hasn't time hasn't changed. Now she didn't have these words and I didn't have those words back then. I'd say well grandma in some ways the person you're describing is a story and that story isn't obliterated by the death of your physical body and I don't think that formulation is antithetical to Christianity. Now I do believe in the resurrection. The story and the flesh come back together. I think that's the meaning of resurrection and I see this as kind of yeah okay I'm a Christian pastor I'll lay my cards on the table. I think all of these attempts to reduce Christianity are reductions and I think this is a retcon reduction of Christianity. This is it. This is. Well that's what all the that's what physicalism says. This is it Bill Moore's like Bill Moore's got his own religious ideas obviously but this is it. Yeah this is it so guess what Joseph Campbell dead. This is mine. If you don't get it here you won't get it anywhere and I hope Joseph Campbell got it while he was here because according to his idea you don't get it anywhere you're done. Sorry YOLO. The experience of eternity right here and now is the function of life. The spirit the experience of eternity right here now is the function of life. Guess I'm going back to the DMV and I'll get in line I'll say do you have like a number you're waiting to be called no I'm experiencing eternity here at the DMV. If you die. For those of you who not are living in the United States that's the Department of Motor Vehicles and here in America that's a government office and that government office tends to reinforce the Republican idea that government doesn't work so well. Now in all fairness to the Democrats I've seen the equivalent overseas and ours works a lot better than overseas but overseas the differential and income made it wealthy enough for me to pay Dionysio to go to the DMV and wait in line for days because that was his job to do that for us rich white missionaries. Ain't colonialism grand. Gosh. Before you die you won't die when you die. Okay remember early early early I told you to remember that okay now you can understand this line he's gonna give it to us in Greek. Anpe thanis ring bethanis denta bethanis o tanpe thanis. Because everything always sounds a little bit more mystical when you say it in another language you don't understand. You can understand this statement in a Christian worldview because you're talking about exactly what he previously denied and what Joseph Campbell just went to great pains to deny. So in a Christian worldview this phrase makes sense but in this physicalist worldview now we're talking hyperbole just like you need to experience not a not a well not a what kind of death. Again are we playing flatliners? Well if that's the best kept secret in history maybe it's time for the secret to get out. You know if you call it a secret you might get into copyright challenges with wasn't it these people? I don't think they have the same psychedelic secret for that. The secret then wasn't that something like I haven't looked at it wasn't something like the law of attraction which again I live in Northern California I've got lots of friends who are really into this kind of stuff. What's the law of attraction? Well I'm going to manifest you know it's sort of like Joel Osteen without the churchiness around him. I'm going to manifest wealth. I'm going to manifest beauty. I'm gonna manifest hair. Long flowing Fabio hair. I'm such a bad youtuber. I'm being a good youtuber when I do this but I guess I'm being a bad pastor because I'm mocking but I I watch people do this stuff and I just think no. Are we done yet? Thanks for tuning into this episode of after school. I'm Brian Marescu and if you enjoyed this video. Marescu that was the secret that I've been waiting the whole thing the whole time to know how to say his name. Thanks for tuning into this episode of after school. I'm Brian Marescu and if you. Marescu because so I want to do another video where I talk about maybe I will maybe I won't I don't know maybe I just got this off my chest in this video and I know I I'm sure some of you are gonna unsubscribe after after you listen to this but or maybe I've just I've just challenged you say you know when Paul VanderKlay comes through for his estuary tour and he has that little drink there I'm gonna slip a little something in it we're gonna watch Paul trip and I don't know if you'd like me when I'm tripping because when I get a little testy like this this is maybe I got a little caffeine in me maybe that's what's making me rational so anyway I don't know if you should forgive me this video or but that's honestly this is how I feel about this stuff and I bought the book in fact I bought it twice I bought the Kindle book and I bought the audiobook and I'm gonna check it out because I'm very curious about the historical aspect again this this guy hasn't dabbled with this stuff I'm interested in the science part of it I'm interested in the conversation but as a platform for a whole new religion that's going to somehow and and again my question at the end of it is please tell me the eschatology you intend for this to yield because if your assertion is that this was in fact the default religion of the classical period we have a pretty good idea about that what that religion yielded and we have a pretty good idea about the kind of religion that over that that basically substituted and replaced it and the growth and dramatic transformation that that religion brought to the world especially in the moral realm doesn't seem to be connected with the happy juice in a temple in Greece that's what I'm saying so in fear and trembling let me know what you think in the comments
