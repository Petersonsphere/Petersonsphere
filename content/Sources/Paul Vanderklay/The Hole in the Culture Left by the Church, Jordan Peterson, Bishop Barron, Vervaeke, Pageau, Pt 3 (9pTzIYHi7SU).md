 This is Paul. Hopefully we'll get through this this time. I think we will. Well, that depends on how much playing of other things that I do. So I finished recording this stuff last week Wednesday because of Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday I had kids in from out of town and church things and so I haven't sat in this chair recorded any content since then. But there's been a slug of good stuff that's been out, much of which I'd like to treat. Jonathan Peugeot had, both had, a conversation with Bishop Barron after this one and a conversation with John Vervecky after this one. I thought the conversation with John Vervecky was outstanding. In a lot of ways it covered a bunch of the stuff that I've been covering with Vervecky over the last couple of years and so I feel some of these conversations are sort of coming to a head. But over the weekend I thought a lot about the the whole left in the culture where the church used to be because I'm trying to get a handle on Jordan Peterson's response, reaction, implicit posture towards the church, John Vervecky's posture towards the church. I was just this morning listening to Audrey Assad, a vocalist whose music I've really loved. I really love her music and a guy who was a musician became an Orthodox priest, Justin Brierley had them on. Thinking about part of why she's no longer identifies as a Christian it's very much God number one, God number two stuff. But for one of part of what haunts these conversations is again the whole left in the culture without the church. Part of that came in the American experiment where there is no federal state church. There were there were state, now the United States is strange because we have this nation which is made up of states not provinces and a lot of people don't know that at the founding of the United States of America many of the states had state churches. The federal government did not have a state church. Massachusetts was one of the last states to no longer their Commonwealth to no longer have a state church that was towards the the first third of the 19th century. So this this experiment over the last 200 plus years of trying to have a culture without a church is sort of what we're coming to the end of and it's by no means clear how to go beyond this and and in some ways the Orthodox would love to step in and say let's pick up where Constantine left off and Rome would love to say well let's you know we already have Rome what else do we need? What happened in northern Europe again was a bunch of these Protestant state churches which I have very little experience of some of you have more experience of them there remains a state church in the Netherlands there remains a state church in England so but but they are by no means acting in the way that it seems implicitly Jordan Peterson and John Vervecky would like the church to respond and so so I see in terms of big long-term conversations this this is sort of where a lot of these questions go because at the end of modernity modernity is sort of the secret sake the secret sister of the church secularism is and secularism sort of says well we can we can sort of act as if that whole isn't really there even though there is no institution there and everything will be fine now I'm gonna pick up pretty much where I left off where at this point in the psychedelic conversation where it'll really turn much more towards the church because Jordan Peterson sees psychedelics and I've got a got a lot of good feedback from many of you on psychedelics and going both ways do you really want your your minister prescribing powerful hallucinogenic drugs I don't I don't want to do it I don't want my colleagues doing it a number of you recognize that there is a church a denomination in the Americas that has al waska as sort of a sacrament okay and this is sort of the experimentation of Protestantism I should maybe pull up some of the tweets I had last weekend but they're not so easily easy to pull up on Twitter maybe maybe they're not too bad you know the culture is sort of caving in on that hole that was left where the church used to be and it's different in Europe of course because in some ways the cathedral still stand and and the cathedrals offer this this this realm of mystery and it's it's almost like Jordan you'd think after what he's been through in the last couple of years he'd have a little bit more hesitation about the use of pharmaceuticals to to really jump start something I just finished also this morning watching his his Cambridge Commons video which was outstanding I haven't seen I haven't seen Jordan that good for a very long time I love the Jordan who's the clinical psychologist who's who's pragmatic and practical and part of the real crime of what's been done to him and his career both as a university professor and as a clinical psychologist is that in many ways he can't do either like he used to and part of the problem with with no longer being able to do that is your stories get old it's part of the reason you know people sometimes say well Paul if you really worked on boosting up your patreon and you know did a bunch of other things you could get a bigger following and then you could leave Living Stones yeah but then all my stories get old I went to seminary with a bunch of professors who were wonderful dear men many of the people at seminary who were my professors weren't so much academics they were an older generation that was just retiring when I was getting there but they had been pastors who had gotten advanced degrees and there was a real difference between the seminary faculty that had done considerable work in local churches with real people and the seminary faculty that had spent all of their time in the Academy and and thought they had some understanding of what it's like to work in a church because they go to church but actually had very little pastoral experience and by very little I mean maybe only one or two years instead of decades and so what tends to happen though even for those professors that had had decades of pastoral experience time moves fast in this culture and their experience gets old and so part for me of the joy of James Frazi corrected me third hemisphere not third lobe and it was it you Grimm that led me down that that that that that that bad nomenclature gotta be careful how much grim grizz I watch you know I gotta throw some of those saving throws myself a third hemisphere I'd love I'd love for Jordan to be able to do some of the things that clearly makes his heart sing part of what's key maybe it maybe I'll just maybe I'll just play it from the from the Cambridge conversation was his mission statement is which is to he wants to save Western civilization one person at a time that's that's really what he's up to and he in that sense wants to be able to dispense among crowds broadly through his books through his videos what he was able to do person by person as a clinical psychologist to for proximal betterment to you know it's John Verveke it's so in part of the reason I listen to Grimm Grizz and a bunch of the other guys doing commentary on my video is I learned so much from you doing commentary on my video I learned a ton and you know John Verveke when I keep talking about dead reckoning John Vickie said well Jordan talks about that I'm thinking well what how does Jordan talk about what I'm talking about when I'm talking about dead reckoning and then I listened to it I thought oh yeah he is talking about that it's it's sort of this when you're working with people who are they're real people they're in a context they have real struggles they have real problems it's you work towards proximal betterment really let's let's make life a little bit better and so Jordan that Cambridge video was was really was really right there again and I really haven't heard him there again part of that is context of these conversations but but part of but I haven't seen him there for a while there's no political reason to have some suffering person under your dominion carry a sack of wet salt that weighs a hundred pounds from one side of a compound to another no no that's you man corrupt great to hell and so you know you think that practically a Calvinist that's pretty terrible but and it is pretty terrible but there is one advantage to specifying evil in a very distinctive and precise manner is that when you specify something that precisely you also specify its opposite right so if there's evil of that depth then well there at least in principle might be the opposite of that which would be the force that might resist it and so while I was looking into the heart of darkness let's say the light started to shine through and you know that start partly when I started to understand it was a little bit before that that and and this I think is his core story this is this is this is Jordan this is the core of his mission and that's what people don't understand his mission isn't finally political and you'll hear him say things like well I'm not I'm not really a political person you say hey keep talking about politics and culture war yeah he does but that's all in service of this this for Jordan is the center of his soteri ology you should not lie and I shouldn't say so I shouldn't say soteri ology is his plan of salvation sorry that's started shine through and you know that start partly when I started to understand it was a little bit before that that you should not lie that's a big mistake you think you can first of all I'll tell you one thing I don't know what happens in this Cambridge Union where this girl to yellow vest sits next to him it's like she got there last and got the the seat right next to the speaker and I don't know who's setting up the camera shots but watch her though oh she's chewing on her nails she's checking her watch she's checking her phone she's bored you know Peterson when he talks he likes to zoom in right on one person and talk right to them you know we always says that's how we that's the best way to do it and you know just wait for him to turn and just be you know you got a little probably a little distance between that's partly the camera angle but you know just zoom right in on her and say I never saw any of my clinical clients ever get away with anything ever you know we track their misery back to its origination point and sometimes it was a mistake on their part often in a moral error which they knew was a moral error when they were committing it but may have forgotten about afterwards moral error like working on those cuticles on a video that happened and people are gonna watch it feels so bad for it became unconscious in some sense are you talking to me I'm sorry that's I'm so oh I distract myself he's talking such serious stuff in here this is this is the core of Jordan Peterson saying and I can't help but watch her nails with her Apple watch it's just it's just it's just the perfect little picture this is this is the culture in a snow globe right here we just turn it over and Jordan Peterson's falling down and she's just sitting there meaning meaning has like I think it was um my friend who sends me the art and she's like she's like you know all my mates are at the pub my mates are at the pub when's this guy gonna end and he's only answered five questions we've been here for an hour and a half but yeah like I'm one to blame if you ever listen to my question and answers habitual or was a moral error that someone else that they were beholden to a lot was she thinking about picking the nose I on the part of their mother or father someone they were tanking okay okay okay I gotta go back I gotta listen to him again I gotta stop being distracted by the girl in the yellow vest I just can't help see her every time you keep that keep this camera angle then I can focus it's a big mistake you think you can first of all I'll tell you one thing that I never saw any of my clinical clients ever get away with anything ever you know we track their misery back to its origination point and sometimes it was a mistake on their part often in a moral error which they knew was a moral error when they were committing it but may have forgotten about afterwards so became unconscious in some sense or habitual or it was a moral error that someone else that they were beholden to a lie on the part of their mother or father someone they were tangled up with someone malevolent but yeah the pigeons come home to roost man and how that's a CS Lewis point too it's a big CS Lewis point every everything you do is moving you a little closer to heaven or a little closer to hell remember the first time I heard him say that he was on Dave Rubin with Ben Shapiro and he said it was like bang that's that's that's nearly word-for-word out of CS Lewis's mouth and that's before to my knowledge he had read a lot of the Lewis how could it be otherwise you really think you really think you have the capacity to bend the structure of reality without it eventually snapping back and hitting you in the face like how arrogant can you possibly be to think that and so well I came to believe that truth in particular spoken truth but not only spoken truth was the antidote to that to that evil and to that suffering really like really truly the antidote to that it's more complex than that but that's something and I also came to believe that each of us have far more and another piece of Jordan's success has been his scalability because a lot of the conversations we're having in this corner of the internet there's way up here in the stratosphere and because his experience as a clinical psychologist he's got this scalability to bring it right down okay God and blah blah blah blah no stop lying let's talk about your life do you have any friends why not what can you do to get some friends now also in this in this video he he says some things which are you know right out of this corner of the internet and you know when he says you know I stopped I stopped directing people and then well that's right and you know after what one of things that he's learned after this is to have more open conversations and that's right I mean there's this is this the Cambridge Union videos one of the best Jordan Peterson videos I've seen in a long long time under our dominion in terms of the destiny of the world let's say then we would ever even care to dare to dread let's say you know I don't know how it works but each of us you know we make decisions between heaven and hell all the time with every decision in fact that's that's Lewis that's right out of mere Christianity every decision that's a decision up or down and in some manner the whole collective enterprise is guided by those individual decisions and right there there's his mission statement there's his path of salvation change the individual change the world it's very evangelical because in many ways evangelicalism is is sort of Protestant Christianity applicable to that make more Christians have a better world if you make more Christians you don't necessarily need the structure of the church at the center of society where that hole is now you instead it's just filled up with all those Christians and in many ways in the United States that's sort of been the way to address it now that doesn't necessarily address everything but that's sort of been the North American approach to a society you don't necessarily need an institution like a state church or the Roman Catholic Church or an Orthodox Church of Russia Russian Orthodox or Antioch and Orthodox or something like that you don't need a structure you just need Christians to fill it up and they'll be close enough to a structure that that will get you there and so it's in that sense I made videos about this years ago it's in that sense that Peterson is very very Protestant and almost evangelical it's not washed away in in the mix you know it's not it's somehow not just your trivial action in the sea of seven billion random actions we're networked and and our our actions echo and what we do or don't do or what we do deceitfully has ramifications far beyond what we can immediately see or often are willing to immediately see it's like you know the one more the only more frightening realization than nothing you do matters is the realization that everything you do matters if you can find a conversation between Tim Keller and kind of a new age ish author where he's asked about divine election now Tim Keller is Protestant Church of our Presbyterian Church of America that's a that's a that's a confessional reformed church and when asked about when asked about you know sovereignty God sovereignty Providence divine election these things he made almost that's exactly the same point as Peterson I think it's dead right if you're if you're if you think that everything is up to you well the butterfly of like this is you know that this is you know you're not gonna have a meaning crisis you're gonna have a crisis of too much meaning if you think nothing if you think nothing you do matters well then you're having a meaning crisis and and both are both are true in some ways but again this is this is where Peterson is really good and where he's he's able to really scale down to the granular as well as having conversations at this other level it's like you want to pick a existential terror you think meaninglessness is terrifying you try its opposite and you see how terrifying that is but it's a terror it's a holy terror right it's a terror that sustains and ennobles and every single person knows that that is true knows that you're fleeing from your destiny by avoidance of the necessity you're the necessary responsibility that your conscience calls you towards everyone knows that you know and we toy with it because we can and we try to avoid it because we test we're immature and we're bitter often and it's not surprising because people suffer dreadfully and it's very difficult to suffer dreadfully without becoming bitter but it doesn't help they all it does is make checking your phone now sit somewhere else set up your room differently I beg you suffering worse and spreads it and if the suffering is morally objectionable spreading it is she should just reach around with it just quick grab a selfie with Peter hardly going to rectify that and so yeah I'm optimistic about about our possibilities because I think we can do anything we set our minds to and so hopefully we'll set our minds to the proper things and every single one of you have to make that decision and one of the things I've really been struck by I talked with Andy no two weeks ago I spoke this is a moderate Democrat isn't gonna turn around and say young lady it's now really the appropriate the proper time to be looking at your phone haven't you just taken a couple couple tiny little ticks down towards hell instead of up to heaven I mean do your nails at home sit in the back what anyway it just I gotta listen to that video and not and not watch it but when I do these I watch them so keeping that in mind so why the psychedelics and and again I see maybe I should play the other piece of that video too which was so outstanding hopefully she's not in it here it is this is another great part how your view relationships has changed and since you talked at the Union three years ago how have your other opinions changed and why and again the little one of my less desirable mentions members of my consciousness Congress wants to say and and are you and are you no longer a custodian of the patriarchy and and all those culture war issues and I loved his answer here I thought his answer here was all the dude has a Yankee shirt on he can't be all bad except for that headband well one thing that's changed most of this is a deepening I would say rather than a transformation of beliefs but it's a deepening in the specification of things that I'm more dimly apprehended before one of the things I've really learned more explicitly I would say in the last six months is to not win I knew this already in my clinical practice I never I tried my best not to be right and this is something this is something I was gonna say you learn as a pastor but I know plenty of pastors who haven't learned it ever this is something you can learn as a pastor which sounds strange because the church is all about giving the right answers but and and there's truth to that too you know so for example as a clinician you can dispense advice and so it'd be quite easy especially if I wasn't suffering at that time well practicing as a clinician and the person was I think well you know I've got my life together pretty well and I'll just tell you what you should do and sometimes people would ask for that right but it's not that helpful because well what some people ask me for that and then they'd say well just tell me what to do and I said I've told you plenty to do and you haven't done what I've said so maybe when you start doing what I've told you to do before you know I'll give you some more advice until then we're gonna resume with plan a which is just doing a lot of listening and some encouraging and every now and then just a little nudge and say did you think about this what the hell do you know about what they should do you know you can introduce topics of conversation like what now keep that in mind because that's gonna come up a little bit later in the Peterson Baron verveky Peugeot conversation because this this reactive cut this reactive posture is in all of us well most people have friends and you don't seem to have any and you know maybe you have a reason for that and maybe it's a you know fundamentally valid reason and that's not where your interests are oriented maybe you're particularly introverted which doesn't mean you don't need friends but that's way different than saying well here's what you should do and the problem with here's what you should do is first of all as the psychoanalyst knew you just set up resistances in people and the reason so they won't do it even if they want your advice and often they'll do the opposite just out of spite and probably they should because they're basically saying up yours it's like this is my life man not yours and the other problem with advice is keep that in mind when we have Peterson talk thinking about church and the hole in the culture where the church used to be is well let's say you go you take my advice and then you go do something good it's like well whose victory is that is it yours or mine so what did I just steal your victory well that's not so good and so I learned that pretty thoroughly as a clinician not to do that and hopefully as a husband and father also not to do that but in my talks with people like Sam Harris I was more instrument and actually when I think about my father that's something my father knew well and Peterson talks in this video that I loved this video this was a great video better than the than the than the four horsemen video frankly not to take anything away from I mean just conversations are different I know I did some ranking in the first one and some people loved it some people hated it people shouldn't I'm not rating I'm not grading the people I'm rating performance I'm rating a particular conversation I'm rating the angel of the conversation if you're deep into Jonathan Peugeot and and you know my sermons are not like my children you know sometimes they're horrible and anyway so this was it so he talks about his father and he talks about his mother it was deeply personal in this and and part of this was I think it was it was Peterson it was Peterson again he's surrounded by some students and one of the deep tragedies of this whole chapter has been the loss of him for you know the university and I know they have this little another one starting in Austin and I think it would be nothing better for Jordan to find a place there and to be able to teach classes again and to be able to have a clinical practice again and alongside of the book writing and the other stuff too because again there's there's things you can do you have to keep close to the knitting to the texture of life that's that's that's the continual fount of of of freshness and and new information and that's how you can actually continue to stay vital in a conversation mental than I should have been there were points I was trying to make you know and I was trying to be right and you know there's just times for that and there's partisan situations where only one side can win and another side has to lose an election is like that but I've really learned I hope that in the last six or seven months to not do that not to do that and so the last conversation I had with Sam Harris which was two weeks ago which will be released in a relatively short order was by far the best conversation we ever had and all I did was ask him questions and that wasn't manipulative it wasn't like well I'm gonna you know and no one has here in the audience has done this yet but lots of times people ask me questions they're not questions they're disguised criticisms or their statements of belief or they're an observation that perhaps if my Christian beliefs for example were more fully differentiated I accepted Christ as my Savior that that would be a good thing that comes up quite often and they're not questions like a question is question is something you want just write down next time I see Jordan Peterson okay Jordan has your Christian have you become more differentiated have you accepted Jesus into your heart I shouldn't joke but the answer to like actually you you know you want to know what the person thinks and so all I did was ask Harris questions and I learned all sorts of things about the way he thought that I didn't know and about commonalities in our approach to problems that I didn't understand and and so those of you have been following my channel for a while and don't just listen to the videos I make about Peterson or the videos I make about Tom Holland or the videos I make about whatever but if listen to the Randall's conversation that's exactly the point of those this is how people change slowly it takes time you know listening again to that maybe I'll pull it up on the screen you know listening to this this conversation with Audrey Assad and we also live in such a strange world because I'm so deeply moved by her music and then to the same with Jennifer Knapp I love Jennifer Knapp's rawness in her music and I especially the ones before she sort of made peace with her sexuality as as it were people are not widgets to be converted people are image bearers to be loved and if you don't get that you don't get Jesus that's that's that's what we're here to do and things can get all tangled up sometimes for the best of intentions but that that's why you know when I first started making videos I'd get emails from people who'd say you know I was talking to someone on the channel who wasn't a Christian and then I failed to present the gospel to them in just the right way that they were imagining and I'd get an email there's one woman used to write me and she'd be like you know what if they what if they die right after the conversation and that's why I'm a Calvinist because in a sense Calvinism says okay that's that's God's business okay I'm not gonna presume to sit in his chair and it doesn't mean that that what we're doing here doesn't matter and it isn't some some blind election it's just that the the the ways of the Almighty are his and he has given me things to do and I must do them and and at the core of doing them is to love his image bears as Christ loved the church because that's the whole story and so so we have a conversation and we talk and we meet and whether it's Sam Harris or Daniel Dennett or Richard Dawkins or a Nazi or a racist or a whatever whatever person you think is beyond the pale and reprehensible you sit and you talk and you hope that in the process of the conversation they might in one way or another have a little bit of a window open to the grace and mercy and joy and beauty of God that they might see God and they might say I'm gonna spend eternity somewhere I'd like to be it I'd like I'd like I'd like it to be with him because he is the source of beauty and joy and everything good that I have even if I've had a wretched life come to just taste a little bit of is there anything better the conversation was much more enjoyable I mean the give-and-take of our previously more tendentious conversations had and what would you say there was an element of sort of combative enjoyment to them so they weren't nothing and they were reasonably successful as public spectacles and I suppose as philosophical investigations but this was way better way better and I understood what motivated Sam way more than I did before and and I've been doing a lot of I hope political peacemaking between Democrats and Republicans in the US because that better happen and you know I've managed on the moderate Democrat side to convince convince to learn along with a variety of moderate Democrats that even when dealing with their you know the people across the aisle that winning is not a good strategy or maybe it's better than losing let's say it's not an optimal strategy right that's a better way of thinking about it there are and if you're trying to win the conversation that might be better than losing you know but it's not as good as mutual self elevate mutual elevation in the progression of the discourse that's way better that's a real victory and so I hope that I've learned that you know more deeply and that I can take that to heart more deeply and then I can govern my actions I have conversations that are very tense with people well I always have and that certainly hasn't stopped and I have to tread very carefully and any I imagine he always has instrumentalism on my part you know because one of the things you want to do when you win is dominate in some sense right and that's a cheap victory I would say it's better than losing perhaps you know because sometimes you can retreat and let the other person have the floor let's say but Dallas Willard who used to teach at philosophy at USC and was a remarkable Christian man one of his rules was never have the last word that was that was all about this it's not the optimal solution not at all and man you just you just have no idea how far you can get with people if if what you do is ask them questions because you're interested in what they think and so damn useful for them because then in the discourse they reveal and it's and it's the power of love that's what it is because to love is to listen and to listen is to love. ...of themselves that they really didn't know and what's also interesting I've seen people do this I had a striking example of that within my own family where one of my family members was had a grudge against another and we waited it out instead of confronting it directly and the person with the grudge laid... must have been hard on Jordan I don't know maybe it wasn't I don't know... ...out why they had the grudge and it was so it was a character description of the person they were angry with and it was it was so unlike the person that well the person who had the grudge was revealing the story they realized that this was some fantasy they'd concocted like 15 years previously and pretty much abandoned it right after the utterance and it takes time to get to that point and and I think part of this is the the terror of a godless world where there is no time because if if there is no if there is no purpose if there is no telos if there is no destiny bigger or larger than ours then it's all chance and chaos and it's going to go careening off and and the reason that people believe that because they've seen things go careening off I understand that things careen there's a crappy towel that's full of someone's shit right outside my door and I'm gonna have to clean it up a little bit later and I'll have a bad attitude about it but and there's toilet paper and shit strewn right outside my office I can't open my office door without smelling the feces of my fellow man the people I love life is like this and so you take time and and I know that many of the people that I have loved who have lived in the street have died before they have achieved or received any kind of redemption that I would have for them I know that but I also know that the cheap forced tricks seldom achieve what we want them to achieve either that is that doesn't mean there isn't the time for involuntary incarceration or you know I'm not saying that making any of those statements I'm just saying again there is a time to stop someone in their tracks and to confront them and I've I've done that and I've done it and it's worked and I've done it and it hasn't but again people are image-bearers to be loved not problems to be fixed what people are and so that happens frequently you know if you really disagree with someone first of all that's interesting because you're wrong and stupid and if they really disagree with you they might know something that you really need to know right rather than talking to someone that already agrees with you I mean that's hard because there's still points of conflict but it's worth digging for that if you can find it and then there's also the possibility that many of the differences are purely misunderstandings that's very frequently the case and then there's also the possibility that well the person engages in this dialogue well first of all they're happy about you because you're listening and people love that band they love that more than you listen to people you really listen to them instead of thinking about what you're gonna say next or trying to win you'll have so many people around you so soon that you won't even be able to stand it there's my life right there right there I started listening to people online and I've got too many people online and I apologize to many of you that I haven't gotten back and you've asked for conversations and you can never get a rando slot and you want me on your little podcast and and or you want me to write something for you and and and and and I never got back and I haven't done it it's the world is weird so that's really something man to do that and so that's a pathway to listening that's for sure all right now I wasn't gonna make a video about this video I was gonna make a video about this video and when it comes down to the psychedelics again I just look at this as is this how we're gonna get people's attention again I'm not saying it doesn't and I'm I don't want I don't want pastors administering this stuff I'm not going to so okay so let me Jonathan I'm curious about this I mean I your cautions are duly noted on my end I saw see what happened say in retrospect when the hallucinogens were introduced to Western culture right I mean it didn't work very well and and many people are self-medicating with them I mean what's going on at Johns Hopkins I think is a world different from people playing around with the stuff which I think is the vast majority of cases of their use and look at what happened to Timothy Leary so for example I had his old job at Harvard by the way oh I didn't know that yeah yes many people have pointed that out to me Jordan by the way Jesus of all the weird things in any case you know Marche Eliade also believed that the true shamanic tradition wasn't psychedelic driven no and that was an aberration I think he was wrong I really do believe that he was wrong and I think that and I I'm I'm also not entirely convinced that that the practices that you're describing can produce experiences that are as intense as those that are produced chemically maybe they are but even if they are they're not they're not available to the typical person they take tremendous amount of training and then so that's a big problem and then is that a problem is that a feature well and and right there we have the question of scale not only in terms of scale about those who are maybe have low IQ those who have had less opportunity at education those who have on a on a let's say a vocational spectrum those who work with their hands rather than with their lips and their minds and words I mean there's lots of different scales and part of what we want I mean part of what we want is a society where people are listened to and people are loved and part of what we the problem that we have now is that people who are anti-hierarchical well one of the one of the things one of the ways we have created hierarchies are that now your local pastors compared to Bishop Baron or to me and I can't have a relationship with you like you can have with your local pastor or your small group leader or your father or your mother or your grandfather and and so a big part of the scale is deployment which sort of naturally works in meat space but which you know you had it with writing and then with books and the printing press and now with the internet you know suddenly there's these hierarchies where oh sure maybe Tim Keller can preach a better sermon than your local pastor but Tim Keller can't can't listen to your story or know you or love you face to face and and that's you know I agree with Jonathan and I don't want to get I don't get off the point of this video is not the psychedelics okay I wanted to put that in a video it's over there the point of this video is the church the hole in the culture that that that the church church left behind it's a feature to Jonathan because maybe you need to do all that training to handle the insight you know and and I'm not trying to look for a facile solution here believe me but the church has a hard time attracting people at the moment okay right there the church has a hard time attracting people at the moment why do you care and here's the sense with both John and Jordan as opposed to Bishop Robert Barron and Jonathan Peugeot is disappointment with the church hurt by the church again if you if you listen to this this conversation with with Audrey Assad oh it just breaks my heart listening to this poor girl inspired particularly that tweet that got a lot of attention earlier in the year when you said I no longer consider myself a practicing Christian what would have been the journey up to that point well so in 2016 I was diagnosed with PTSD because I was having anxiety and panic attacks with unknown origin well the anxiety attacks had an origin panic attacks don't usually it's sort of like you don't know what the trigger is for those I had several different battles on that front and I was going to trauma therapy with a Christian therapist actually who at the time that I was going to see her I could not even say the word God without triggering an anxiety attack it was really really hard and so I was had to cancel most of the shows I was doing I couldn't walk into a church building I could not could not bear to be in mass it was really really sad because I did not desire for that to be my reality whatsoever it was just sort of happening and I realized though through those things those notifications that my body was giving me that I had some trauma to process that was spiritual in nature spiritual and religious abuse are very real things and at that time I had not really acknowledged or dealt with any of those realities from my upbringing which is both included the my internalization of the doctrines is part of that but also my experiences with human beings who did in various ways abuse their relationships to me I had one kind of long experience of one of the elders in my church being sexually and romantically forward with me for years that resulted in a lot of pain and residual issues around spiritual leadership and so that was the beginning of the deconstruction which again I really wasn't looking for it sort of just happened it and I found it and it was terrifying partially because of my fears of hell and my fears of God and my fears of doing the wrong thing and partially because my whole living had been made you know in a world where that connection based on shared belief is very strong people were listening to me partly because they like my sound but in a large part also because they believed what I did or shared a lot of that you know perspective on the world so well also the song she were singing I mean the many I mean some of the my favorite my favorite stuff of hers is a lot of the hymn stuff and so it's it's also using you know a tremendous gift of God given to her in terms of her voice and her musical talent to do that that makes a lot of sense and I just was like I feel so responsible for this and I want to be authentic and truthful but I don't know where this is going to land like I might go through this therapy and then be right back where I was and so I don't want to say you know right now that I'm leaving church because I don't I really didn't know if that would be the case yeah I didn't want that to be the case to be honest and and it's like a lot of I'm hearing my critics in my head right now going well why just why not just go back if you didn't want to leave and I wish it was that simple and it's such a long story and someday I'll tell it in more detail but long and short of it is that after a few years of not going to mass because I kept trying to go to mass and having panic attacks I decided to be truthful about where I am right now I didn't want people to feel like I was being deceitful by just kind of being quiet about it and not admitting what had gone on and what it shifted and I did go through an angry phase where I had the burn it all down feeling but again then my I'm not really it's not my style I think to come out of the gate with a torch while I'm still processing my own issues and yeah and what I get from this story is you're as human as anyone else Audrey but the unfortunate aspect of it is that often people who are you know Christian musicians or musicians in general you know with with a following they kind of have to often process you know their own journey kind of in public and that that can be a really difficult thing to do when you've got other people's expectations and following and everything else on on your show and I'll get to John Verveckian a little bit but again they're they're trying that they see the culture collapsing in the hole that the that is in the culture where the church used to be and and so Jordan and Jordan's conversations with Bishop Barron the two one-on-ones that he's had that it cycles again and again back to this and I know a lot of some people were really upset by my grading of Bishop Barron he's your hero I get that and if you if you know my channel well enough you can find me at at least two or three occasions just having a having a good bit of a youtuber lust over Bishop Barron and it sounds a little creepy I know but what I mean by that is you know and he gets in there and he's got his you know he's always so well dressed and he's so smart and he's so well educated I watch that and I think I'd like to I'd like to be able to do that a little better and instead I'm poking fun at the girl in the yellow vest I mean I'm I kind of feel myself I'm not all the way to Joe Rogan but yeah I'm a little bit of a monkey and and Bishop Barron is so refined and so smooth and again so many of the comments on the first video I did in the series were so helpful you know one person mentioning he's a Roman Catholic bishop you're gonna hear the party line out of him and and that gets into this this question of what Bishop Barron Bishop Barron Bishop Barron is about to talk about this wisdom tradition and well let's let's let's let them have the conversation then I'll talk about it and I don't know what's happening in in the broad church with regards to the sort of work for example that Griffiths is doing and it's not like I have the answers to these things but I buy we shouldn't Griffiths is did I get an invitation to that I don't know you know he's getting clergy he's trying to get clergy to to participate in these studies I wouldn't for a whole variety of reasons but do I think it's a bad thing not necessarily I'm open that way look to the psychedelics as a as a savior certainly but they should also not know we already have a savior be discounted discounted we'll see are the means by which people can have the means he's speaking off the cuff of sorts of experiences that the scientists the followers of scientists discount it's right there it's right there and again I look back to the first chapter of miracles CS Lewis the only person I ever know who claims to have seen a ghost doesn't believe in one we're very subtle creatures as proof in some sense I'd be more maybe that's irrelevant to the church using the wisdom tradition Jordan as you've been doing I mean the fact that you're drawing a lot of people back toward Christianity through the opening up of the Bible and the wisdom way of reading the Bible that to me is a great way the churches can start drawing especially young people back it's obviously working in your case you know we've got our problems and some of it came from the scandals certainly but some came from an exaggerated attempt to be relevant to the society and to sort of dumb down our language and to make it sound like an echo of the culture that's what did us in I think in terms of attracting younger it became more evangelical people but and you know I agree with many of the points here that Baron makes but I'm when I listen to Audrey Assad and not just the clip that I played but the whole thing that's much more of what I hear there are deeper questions and so and and there are multiple issues in front because everyone's an individual and they participate in some and they don't participate in others there definitely are patterns and commonalities but you know a lot of I'll just let it finish what you're doing opening up the the scriptures that's what the Church Fathers did and people are flocking to that because they they find in that the wisdom tradition and through the wisdom tradition they're finding mysticism authentic mysticism a contact with God so I think that's the route to go it's we have to deal with our moral issues we have to deal with the scandals that's for sure and we have to deal though with this dumbing down of the faith and this flattening out of the faith that's I think what is really compromised our mission I did the medieval faithful Catholic who was smuggling the Eucharist to his or her sick cow was it dumbed down I mean we're part of part of why the scale problem is so difficult is because of many of our successes where you know Audrey Assad will continue to say well I you know she was raised in a Plymouth Plymouth brethren church and she believed me she didn't she never heard about Martin Luther until she was of a certain age and I thought oh my goodness I heard of Martin Luther you know almost right away and so she had been raised in a narrow context and the internet's just sort of blows all that apart and so part of the difficulty with the scale problem is to be able to resource and support and and I think a lot of that has to be personal it has to go through the kinds of conversations and the listening and the kind of process that Jordan was talking about in in that video I couldn't find the portion in I couldn't find the portion in reformations but you know part of what happened in the Council of Trent after in the Roman Catholic response to the Reformation was a really modernization to have to contend with what was happening in the Protestant world and the Roman Catholic Church had to do that a lot of there's always this temptation to imagine that if if the church had just kept doing what it had always done then we wouldn't be in this mess and just fill whatever you want in what we've always done and fill whatever you want in this mess the truth is that the church responds to the challenges of each age and in the process of leaving some things behind and trying to renew or do some new things there is loss and difficulty and with a culture that moves so quickly it's it's really hard to get it right and keep it right because keeping it right might be might mean getting it wrong 10 years from now and so on and so forth so you know and I what what conversation did I hear about you know Catholic churches you know and I've had this too when I've I've discussed with Kale Zeldin and and and Brett Sockold you know your your Catholic church on your local street and Audrey Assa just made the comment she grew up in New Jersey hey way to go Audrey well I'm from New Jersey too but yeah you know Christmas and Easter Catholics there are all kinds of them in New Jersey and perfunctory but we had perfunctory in the Christian Reformed Church too so part of why I'm excited about estuary is I want there to be more reading and conversation and that's you know part of the so I've been posting my Sunday school class on this channel and I fully know that watching my Sunday school class online is not anywhere much as much fun as being there much as much fun as being there and I'm hoping to let limited numbers of people into Zoom to be in there but we're still Rick and I are still trying to work out sound and a whole bunch of other things for that class and get it into a format that Rick and I can just basically get in and get out without me having to do a whole bunch of put up and take down every week but in my adult Sunday school class this is where we explore and we do it with a small group of people and it doesn't scale for everyone just usually a handful of people in that Sunday school class but I want people to say what they think even if it's heterodox in the group because if that's what they think that's what they think and we're not going to deal with it unless we get it out there and get the chance to talk about it and so if that's what Bishop Barron means about the wisdom well he's talking wisdom and so we could think about it as as sociology did it just get your attention Nate Hile thinking about it as as wisdom and putting the pieces together could I pick up on now you see any yeah sorry go ahead John because like I think this is part first of all I want to I want to challenge two things you said Jordan I've had both experiences and I've had peak versions of both and I can't find them ultimately distinguishable like through a contemplative practice and taking a psychedelic they have and when you took a look at the research people say they can be the same they tend to orient a little bit differently the psychedelic experience the second and it hasn't made John a theist sorry John the elic mystical experience tends to on average be a little bit more impersonal and that's where some of my skepticism lies that I and a number of people made that comment on Twitter and in comments that well for for some Sam Harris types it can sort of shake them out of a simplistic materialism but it's it's not sufficient it has to be if if the church is thinking that this is going to be an important part of figuring out how to deal with the whole and the culture that the church left behind I don't necessarily see it the contemplative one tends to be a little bit on average more personal in the ontology but no no deep you know differences and the other thing I would say is you know I don't know how much we have to rely on them I take your point that it's instructive and I think the science should do it I think it's immoral to not investigate these substances because of the clear evidence that's mounting for their ability to alleviate you know untreatable addiction depression a host of issues and so and I on the on the pharmaceutical side I agree with John Vervecki there I think I think these substances should be studied when I read Michael Paul and his book that you know the substances should be we study all sorts of substances and the and the and the possibilities of of helping people with them I'm not an anti-vaxxer but I also have a degree of I I see these as having a place in the whole scheme of things I think we should keep doing the science I'm not but you know the research sort of reliably indicates that 30 to 40 percent of the population have these transformative experiences that's what Taylor says I think the problem someone made in the comment section I don't remember who or maybe it was on Twitter oh it was Mark it was Mark it was Mark LeFavor who writes if you if you're not reading Mark's comments on my videos you're missing out because Mark will usually put together fairly meaty comments now I know Mark's opinions are are are not to everybody's taste and and Mark for being part of the awakening from the meaning crisis group is about as hard on John Vervecki as anyone but you know the comments that Mark made with respect to psychedelics I wanted to segment that in all in the other video it is not unlike the comments that I got from from James Frazzi who is in our local meetup and has been on my channel and talks about how for some people experimenting with psychedelics is a disaster and experimenting with with pot can be a disaster even alcohol for many people so these are not these substances are not benign and so it's one thing if you've got some blue ribbon study at jobs hopkins with all kinds of constraints around it done by you know in a very controlled setting it's another thing to just play with it because you think oh maybe this will help maybe it will and maybe it won't problem is not an absence of the experience to go to bishops barron's point I think it's the absence of a wisdom framework that allows people to properly appropriate and metabolize these experiences so I I love those two words they're appropriate and metabolize I thought that's that's right I'll do this with in my class I think I mentioned this to you Jordan with my students I'll say well where to go for information and again for my in terms of my grading thing in terms of who who had the best performance in this conversation that's this is again this every time I listen to John in this conversation not to say not to discount what other people have said I'm not against Bishop Barron I'm certainly not against Jonathan Peugeot or Jordan Peterson but I thought John made really salient points in this conversation that you know they're on his side but they they they temper his points and so I thought it was very fair and wise blah blah blah where do you go from knowledge science maybe the university and I'll say where do you go for wisdom and there's a deafening silence that is the hole in our culture that the church left behind where do you go for wisdom and and so when I hear Jordan longing for a church that can do that that he sees as an ally in his mission statement of of helping individuals transform so that their potential can remake the world and and he almost all of his complaints about the church so he just so there was another video that was just released I don't know you get to watch how the cake gets baked here so you just did another one today oh come on no not that one sorry sorry I should have just paused the the meaning and on conceptualization of God that was three parts on the audio podcast and and one part here you know one of the things that I did was I searched for every reference to the church and we can search the transcripts there and this is you know this is what he says about the church all the way back to you can go to YouTube you can search Paul VanderKlay Jordan Peterson Lying Pastor you know all the way back to let's say I made this video in January 2018 so you know oh gosh is it going to be is it going to be four years next month um he did a question and answer where I guess I could probably just play some of it because I had thought about playing some of this his his journey in many ways grew out of the cold war and the threat of nuclear annihilation think that it's particularly easy um the traditions bind the community together now I'm saying that and I don't go to church you know and the reason I don't go to church is because well it drives me crazy to speak frankly I haven't been able to sit in a situation like that ever since I was well ever really that's really the truth of it ever um I'm not convinced that that's a good thing because I do believe and I've had good conversations about this with Jonathan Pagio I do believe that communal return to the source of the community's ethics is actually a necessary thing and maybe I'm atoning for my past sins by doing these biblical lectures at the moment which is something that's communal so and then because there's also something about going where a bunch of other people are to reaffirm your commitment to to the good that you're also all aiming at that's that's got some power in it and and I don't think that that's something that we should forego I think it's dangerous I mean look even if you're cynical about church and I guess I would put myself in that category it's it's certainly the case that communal church going in the 1950s say provided the average person with at least an hour a week where they were contemplating no matter how poorly the purpose of ethics in life and and the idea of a higher purpose and a higher meaning in life and you got to think that spending an hour a week thinking about that is better than never doing it at all so I don't know how to that tradition can be revivified in a meaningful way but I think it's I really do think it's a catastrophe that we've lost it because we don't have a center an ethical center that holds our community together and the consequence of that is that we're fragmenting quite badly so and that's the hole in the culture where the church used to be and and I think that's a that's a classic peterson answer it's self-critical it's um it's it's very honest and transparent and and again this these are these are some of the qualities that I think um have really brought a lot of people to appreciate and love now and if you want to see one of the conversations that I'm actually most proud of it's this conversation with with uh vowsh that I thought was that this is this is of all the conversations I've had this might be this is definitely one of my favorites I don't want to rank them necessarily but you know I I got I was I was sent all kinds of warnings by people before this don't talk to this guy they need to Adam friended and PSA sitch usually rake him over the coals regularly but we we had a very we had a very good faith conversation that I thought was very frank and um it was it was very good and wisdom is not optional you can't you can't well you know what I don't care about being connected and overcoming self-deception and harming other people because of the ways in which I'm willfully I of course it's not optional wisdom is a necessity it's it's an absolute prerequisite it's it's an absolute prerequisite to religion yet our culture right has no no way in general of providing people with the self-deception framework to pry the hole in the middle of the culture where the church used to be assess these experience and also to have properly cultivated a prepared character for them when they do emerge so I would argue that that that's where the the problem lies it's not in the absence I think of these experience for people it's the absence of a framework that allows and a worldview that allows people to properly process them I haven't listened to all of the there's been so much lately all of the artful scaling of religion conversations between layman pascal and brendan graham dempsey brendan graham dempsey did the video on meta modern but again this video is some thinking about the hole in the culture where the church used to be and in some ways that's you know that's john verveckis religion that's not a religion I think we should come back to coherence and artistry and the things that might make a person stay turned on in a particular framing of their wisdom practices in order to give benefits from it but two things have been coming up for me when you guys were talking the first relates to this you know pluralizing the training and explaining problem is an interesting way to go because you have you have sets of practices that will be differently appropriate for different groups and differently amenable to them and then you also have all kinds of different types of translations that need to go on within explaining because explaining is relative to who's hearing it and what the niche is right maybe you want a very technical mechanical explanation maybe you want a very poetic explanation so we obviously need some kind of elite that can manage plural trainings and plural explainings and the space between those things hopefully will be able to hold itself open and remain stable over time the other part of it when we were talking about the you know the the problematic element and the beneficial element of a broader usage of the terms is that there needs to be some kind of verification process right like our bodies are constantly taking in things good for us and things bad for us and we have an immune system we have a verification and vetting process so you asked this earlier joe how did the old world religions handle the problem of doing this because it's it's not problematic necessarily that people believe things that are technically correct it's problematic if those things lead down the wrong pathways yes so adjudicating between that what did they use all right obviously zen has this tradition of interviews where the master has to establish peer resonance with you and also problematize your state change experiences for you i think they had a lot of practices of social isolation of transgression of situations that sort of took a person outside of their normal social framing and experience of reality many of those obviously might have been too ascetic in certain ways they might have been damaging or unhealthy i think if we go much farther back we find a pattern of the ritual humiliation of political and religious leaders where there were things done to yeah make fun of or take them outside of their context so that we don't mistake what's going on in the local practical structure for some kind of reified status and you know we could take all of those things and more because we could make a bigger list and we could add to them a contemporary notion of a therapeutic adjunct to spiritual and religious and wisdom practice training i think so that's very good even and and and the topic of the elites and then the practices by which the elites did not become reified or deified i think that's important so a connection i want to make to that which is again to deepen the problem we had three interlocking institutions right where we had the university the monastery and the church and they were all trying to manage the training explaining and the elite versus the laity relationship like one of the functions of the church was to presumably right manage between the elites and the laity i'm just using that as neutral a term as i can and the monastery concentrated a lot on training for wisdom and the university concentrated much more on explaining for schiancia i don't mean just science but i mean knowledge in general so you had knowledge and you had wisdom and you had something like you know i don't quite know what to call it maybe it's not quite understanding but it's this maybe it's the social integration social cohesion thing you were talking about layman and i'm wondering is that just happenstance or it because you can see similar things right even in the zen situation you have the zen monastery but you have also you have the zen temple and then you have things like the kyoto school where zen is taken up and within a basically an academic setting and developed in powerful ways i might be just seeing a taxonomy because i'm just imposing it because i'm overly platonic in my orientation to reality but i'm wondering if that's happenstance or if that's like if that's part of have institutions to some degree work out an ecology of institutions in order to address the pedagogical pluralism problem and the con conveyor belt and the explaining training problem that's and does that mean that the the religion that's not a religion would need something like that and layman that's important because what it means is we actually have we have kinds of elites if i can put it that way and and and then and they have oh this sounds ridiculously american but they sort of have checks and balance relationships with each other as a way of managing some of the issues right so the monasteries tend to home people are much more mystically oriented right and the church was people are much more sort of missionary oriented if i can put it that way and then the university is people who are much more sort of philosophically oriented and they're all sort of acting as checks and balances on each other and what you i mean they put terrific strain in the history of christianity on the institution but it seems to me that's one of the ways that the old world religions i like that metaphor by the way layman the way i said old religion you change it into old world religions which is really wonderful thank you for that that's beautiful it's really good is that one of the ways in which they address this problem right because i'm trying to get back you know this is brendan's question is like how do we structure this and is it is it that each one of these is doing different things maybe the church concentrates on narrative and maybe the monastery concentrates on trans on something like transcendence or or right and and then the university of course concentrates on theory i'm sorry i'm i'm really waving my hands because i'm trying to look back and trying to address what both of you are saying and see if i can draw anything from that history that might be helpful here well and and the the these institutions grew for a reason and the growth of the university and even if you just follow the history of the university george marsden has written has written on the the secularization of the american university because most of the universities in america most of the private universities in america the historical ones were started as religious organizations and they were there to train clergy they were there to in the christian forum church they were there to train christian day school they were there to equip and to train the church and so they had their function in there and and that has been in in many ways disrupted and displaced now and we've had a few centuries of christianity really kind of falling into the trap of of materialism first of all trying to constantly justify stories through history and some statuette found in palestine or whatever like all these strategies to try to constantly justify the stories through these scientific methods and at the same time focusing on the idea of being saved or going to hell and going to heaven rather than the more mystical tradition which is there it's all there right it's all there and it's all available to us it's just that the emphasis has been i think the wrong one in the past few centuries and this is where i put push back on some of my christian brothers here where it's all there in the way that it's all there in the library and it's all there on the internet it has to be there in the flesh and that's why you need your monasteries need your monasteries and your churches and your universities or whatever new institutions will develop to to take the roles of these as we continue to move forward in history but it it is possible and i think it's happening now and like like bishop barron said i think jordan one of things you're forcing a lot of christians to do is to reconsider what this has to do with my life how it binds it together how it connects us together and we have the church fathers that that just right there it's all there in in their in their teaching and it's there in the liturgy itself and the imagistic vision of the chance and the the iconography and all of this is it's all present we just need to kind of go back and help people connect things together so that they can have true experiences but we forgot a lot of our own tradition or we underplayed it i'll give you one example when i was coming of age in the catholic church so you're now late 70s into the 80s the way we were instructed in the bible so those of us preparing for the priesthood right to be preachers and to be spiritual counselors and soul doctors it was pure historical criticism that was a method of biblical approach that and and he's exactly right and so i then went through seminary in the 80s and it was already turning towards literary criticism which was far and away more helpful in terms of understanding meaning in the text because i would look at the a lot of the stuff from the grammatical historical and it was very difficult it was very difficult as a preacher to figure out how to apply this to people and so i mean bishop baron is correct there but in in all fairness to our to those who who went down the you had the modernist fundamentalist fight um i mean there was a re modernity was completely reshaping the world and the church was trying to adapt and so then maybe there's the strategy of the orthodox to not change versus you know the roman catholic to change somewhat and protestants which are all the way on one side of really trying to not change and all the way on the other side of really trying to change a lot and all the all the modes in between emphasize very much you know what was in the mind of the human author as he wrote and so using very rationalistic methods to kind of break the scriptures down break them apart but the whole idea of meaning about what the scriptures were telling us about god about our relation to god the mystical dimension of life that was all very muted as a result our preaching and i i accuse you know my own generation of this our preaching became very flat often very politicized um maybe psychologized in in the worst sense of that term um but the the mystical depth of the scripture we forgot we didn't read the church fathers as they young himself said the first psychologists were the church fathers it's dead right it seems to me um so we do we share a lot of this blame here by we i mean the religions themselves we forgot our own best traditions and we allowed this scientism to hold sway and that's why people are struggling so i've been trying to figure out and i i don't think it's that simple that's certainly a piece of the problem and i'm not saying he's saying it's that simple but that that is an aspect yet the church had to deal with modernity and it tried to do so and now modernity is leaving so it's fairly comfortable to say oh we've got to get back to what we're doing before modernity and the the benefit of churches is that especially of the orthodox and the roman catholic is because they've got that material so when jonathan bageaux says the church fathers are right there and bishop barron says the fathers are right there and we've got the tradition and they're right and protestants a little you know a little high and dry in that area but then we tend to just default back to the others i mean i really don't know how i'm stunned at the the popularity of the biblical lectures i can't wrap my head around it you know no matter how hard i try um and i can't i can't even judge their significance it's so small or great but they've attracted a lot of views so we'll stick with that so then assuming that they have some significance i've tried to figure out well what was it that made them work why why did people come and listen yeah because it might not work the second time i mean the timing is different i mean who knows who knows if he does exodus whether that will it's always it's always when it's always where the registers meet listen to what i was saying about the though about genesis and i think partly it was because i wasn't exactly telling people what i thought about them i wasn't saying this is how you should read these stories i was trying to investigate something i knew was beyond my comprehension and i was doing that on my feet and i was doing that on my feet now i talked to someone this week who is quite explicitly religious and i could hardly listen to him because he kept telling me what was right he kept telling me the dogma it's like well for are you so sure you know that and like who the hell are you remember the place in the cambridge union where i said remember this because it's going to come up in here right here maybe i can find it now i don't want to look you to tell me that and that and it just there was just no meaning being revealed from that there was no investigation like i approached the bible as a psychologist in some sense but as if it was something okay and right there so we have the hole in the culture where the church used to be and the answer we tend to get from religious people and i'm one of them okay is well let's just switch it right back in there and for some people in terms of their individual life absolutely absolutely so you know john vervecky i couldn't find exactly which conversation there have been so many i mean he's made very clear that for for individuals that he knows who find they were their way back to the religion that they grew up in you know he sees that as you know obviously that's going to address their meaning crisis when i talk about the meaning crisis to people who are well within the inside the church under absolutely no threat of deconstruction they are always sort of like what meaning crisis that they are they are within there is no hole in the culture for them it fits right in but this is so again the one comment in the first video and i wish it were easier to go back and find youtube comments that i think are are really good sometimes i i screen capture them because they're i mean some of your comments that you leave on my videos are tremendous and lately with when i do these kinds of commentary videos they get way more views and i can't keep up with the comments and many of the comments are are exceptional and really very wonderful but you know one of the persons said well he's he's there making the point of the church and this is for the church to be a living organism it has to just in some ways sit right there on chaos and order it has to be right there in the middle of it and that's one of the things that peterson got right and so what that means and an estuary group is there's going to be chaos and order that's that's you know those of you have some of you figured this out already the salt water and the fresh water the water comes out of the salt water and the fresh water the water coming down from the mountain the water coming in from the sea there will see monsters in the sea the order up on the top of the hierarchy where the fresh water is coming from this estuary has is the meeting of chaos and order in many ways and and so part of what peterson is complaining about why he on one hand is lamenting the hole in the culture where the church used to be well at the same time not going back into that hole and and filling it back in with the churches he says i i'm not seeing the kind of dynamic encounter and journeying that is that is disruptive enough to the order but in a fruitful way and that's terrifying in the church because we don't want to lose found knowledge but at the same time in the church we are we we usually hopefully in our better days acknowledge that our found knowledge and wisdom is always limited and and and subject to improvement but the improvement can't be disorderly it has to be productive and and in the in the in the span of things you don't know and so it's only over long amounts of time that orthodoxy and heterodoxy sort of co-generate at the same time and it's only in a long period of time where you you begin to see orthodoxy manifesting itself and understanding and i mean very long periods of time much longer than our short little lives which is why the church is always a vital center and why its absence is missed missed in terms of wisdom missed in terms of meaning missed in terms of wisdom missed in terms of meaning missed in terms of knowledge missed in terms of a healthy society missed in terms of how do we make decisions about good bad right and wrong and morality missed there's a reason there's a hole in the culture where the church used to be and and we and we know we need to somehow we need something in that place again and and so jordan you know john has his religion that's not a religion and jordan is you know has his project of of individual salvation of proximal betterment but again i look at that it's not going to be enough and i think john vervecky is aware of that with you know with the scaling problem and the issues involved with that something i really didn't understand a strange artifact god only knows that there was no investigation i kind of thought that like i approached the bible as a psychologist in some sense but as if it was something i really didn't understand a strange artifact god and and he always says as a psychologist but never just as a psychologist jordan clearly is approaching it with his whole person and and sometimes he'll you know make that disclaimer but i think part of why it was living was he he engaged it with his whole person and notice he he he caught the attention not just of low status people like me but others who have more status and in religious institutions god only knows what it is it's this book that's been around forever cobbled itself together in a manner we can't understand it's lasted for a very very long period of time it's had an inestimable impact it's full of extraordinarily strange stories that that we understand very little about in some profound sense and it was an investigation and i kind of pulled people along with me during the investigation and that that seemed to and and maybe when i when i go to church and that's i'm not going to compare my adult sunday school classes to his biblical series because they're they're very different beasts but and that's what i try to do in in bible studies and in small groups is we're on a journey together to listen to this book and to feed off of this book and to take this book into ourselves do i see do i see that do i feel that i'm being led along an investigation into the structure of deep meaning and the answer is not usually i usually feel as if i'm being told what to think or told what to believe and now i have to find it but that's way different than saying well here's what you should do and the problem with here's what you should do is first of all as the psychoanalyst knew you just set up resistances in people and the reason so they won't do it even if they want your advice and often they'll do the opposite just out of spite and probably they should because they're basically saying up yours it's like this is my life man not yours and the other problem with advice is well let's say you go you take my advice and then you go do something good it's like well whose victory is that is it yours or mine so did i just steal your victory well that's not so good and you can make a good living on youtube doing exactly that because there's always the the tribe your little tribe of the already convinced that just simply loves to hear you win loves to hear you dunk on someone on the internet and then there are video there are places in video to make the point of being right and make the argument where the ecosystem is is fed with people making their case strongly i have no problem with that but when it comes to to to making our points face to face it's so much better to to treat each other like people that's just that doesn't seem to work it's but the church fathers priest exactly the way you're describing and we we luckily have some of these sermons like of augustin that he gave we'd say off the cuff there was a secretary out the crowd who take them down and if you want little bits of augustin sermons on twitter follow eric dirksen i'm i'm not sure you know there's a sense in which i agree with his point here and there is a wildness to the church that you find in augustin and many others um but it's a it's a i've been i've been listening again to the eye of the needle which is this really fascinating book by peter brown on the history of the church and money um in the in late antiquity and it's it's so instrumental in in figuring out just the the complexity and it's a radical difference of why john vervecky talks about stealing the culture that would be a book worth reading in terms of that investigation because it just shows all of the layers it just all of us talking on the internet isn't gonna cut it it's just deeply true he would probably polish them later but you get a sense of someone who's doing what you're saying i think thinking through with the text as he goes um he was theologizing philosophizing but he was he was trying to draw his people he was a pastor augustin he wasn't an academic he wasn't a professor of theology at a university he was a pastor trying to draw his people closer to god and he and you know you look at someone like cyprian he's a politician you know cyprian and it's they didn't have the kind of developed formal institutions and structures we have today you know for a whole variety of reason the world is different you know old world religion i like i like that phrasing of it from the that vervecky scaling video too learn the method by the way from ambrose when he goes to ambrose in milan he's a he's a manakee he's not even a christian but he heard and ambrose is an interesting critter just caught here in the book you know in in in 374 ambrose stepped straight from the governorship to a sea in milan with the support of none other than petronius probis the roman magnet of legendary wealth and um and tentacular tentacular influence whom we met in chapter one and in in 393 in distant spain priscilla became bishop of avila again through the support of wealthy zealots it's the you know and then of course to have the question of in the in the late middle ages at the context of the protest and reformation the the relationship between you know government and church radically different than what we see today i've been reading this fascinating book by john omali on vatican one the church and the making of ultra um ultra montane the ultra montane church it's a fascinating book a lot of history about the the struggles in france between gallicanism and ultramontanism which is you know the ideas of papal infallibility we've been working on the questions of what what should be at the center of a culture for a very long time and with with the span having gotten so much larger than what you see let's say in in old testament israel and and what we try to know there all the way out into these you know enormous states and churches it's just it's a huge issue heard that ambrose was a great rhetorician so he went to hear his rhetoric and while he was there he learned the method of reading the bible which is this more allegorical spiritual method that's what young appreciated that's what you're doing in many ways the young augustin learned it from ambrose and then he bequeathed that to us in his sermons and biblical commentaries but trust me when i tell you we didn't study that we didn't study that approach ours was a very scientific rationalistic approach to the bible and that's why preaching is relatively bad i would say so you've in a way stumbled on something that's very old you know but still has enormous power to transform people there's also it's not but you know there's a sense in which that answer tempts us to imagine oh i'll just do like augustin and some would argue that augustin is you know a very early psychologist if you just read augustin's confessions but it's going to be different and the fact that that peterson did it in the bader theater and now he's going on another book tour and it's going to be different because the world is different and this is where you know this isn't somewhere where i'm sort of caught between the two sides of let's see if i can get it dyslexic me the two sides of of here where on one hand yes the i mean that's i'm a protestant i mean that that's exactly where protestants are sort of caught up and down the the difference here something important jordan in understanding that at least that the traditional churches at least the liturgical churches that you don't you don't them like for example the orthodox church they always here it comes see and again this was the teaser at the beginning of the video but when you hear it in this context it's different than when you hear it at the beginning of the video and it's this teaser like it's slap are you slapping the protestants around now come on jonathan i always say if the sermon is more than 15 minutes it's pride like keep your sermons as short as possible because you're not there to know obviously obviously two weeks in a row i've kept my sermon short here at living stones don't expect it to last too long be guilty of that you're not well you're not there i mean it's propositional understanding is fine but it's participatory like church is participatory so you enter into the church you say like you imagine an orthodox and that's part of the reason that i've always loved bible studies my adult sunday school class um where let's let's have a conversation let's go back and forth let's listen to each other now now again that doesn't scale well we're i'm surprised how well it's scaled on scaled on youtube but it's not always terribly gripping to listen to somebody else's conversations there are many people and and you can't you can't give your devotion to each the same structure even a traditional catholic church you have a space which is structured as the hierarchy ontological hierarchy of being and then you see these images which are patterned and are revealing to you these mysteries that are beyond words and then you participate in this singing these processions and it is it is a participative thing and so if you go there to kind of get knowledge it's not the same type of of practice and as you're singing these songs and as you're hearing these hymns all of a sudden two images connect together and all of a sudden you know these things start to connect inside you in somewhat in almost a kind of super rational way and they're very deep and they're they're embodied as you bow down as you kneel as you eat the body and and and blood of christ these are these are different types of participation than just and janathan i'm totally in agreement with you and what did we do in our catholic churches in the west the same time we were presenting the bible in this in this flattened out historical critical way we also were flattening out our churches emptying out our churches of just that mystical cosmic symbolism the angels the saints color the cosmic dimension and we flatten them out and we made them like you know empty meeting spaces and again i agree i agree with him but again back to the audrey assad she went from plimoth brethren darby dispensationalism to roman catholic and left that it's that's that's helpful we need to bring in the the mystical and the mythical but it's the scale issue is all the way across the board so again i agree and more so there was a terrible rationalism that descended upon the church and it dried us up in many ways um you know so i this is again my mea culpa as a catholic i think we passed through a period that was really problematic and and recovering the sources the you know we say right recovering the great sources of the bible and the fathers that's what that's what we're talking about what the bible had by its nature what the fathers understood that's what we need to revive the church i think now in case you haven't seen this one the collective intelligence angels in scientific terms another outstanding video but i this this was interesting because again i you know i said i've said what i've said about barren and but i thought this shed a lot of light on it too and i really appreciated jonathan's thought and it's interesting because with adding mr barren the conversation definitely morphed into something completely different yeah yeah because he's not involved in this kind of inner the way that we've been talking about religion let's say for the past several years you and i and jordan in our different ways but kind of coming towards similar ideas about phenomenology or in your sense more kind of coxsai and jordan's evolutionary approach all of this is kind of coming towards something and bishop barren is dropping out from outside with with a more kind of catholic thomas and augustinian way of thinking so it for me was that was one of the most interesting things was to watch the discussion move toward the direction where all of a sudden i could see in bishop barren's eyes that he was like oh this is like there's something else going on here there's another type of discussion yeah he just wrote a i just read it this morning i didn't read it thoroughly i just read parts of it he wrote a blurb a blog gris tried looking that up it's on word on fire gris that's that's bishop barren's that's bishop barren's space about uh and yeah he was very clearly appreciative in all three senses of the word of the discussion and so i think i think your observation is accurate so look but bishop you're doing something right obviously you're attracting some online attention some substantial online attention and jonathan the same is true of you and well jon it goes without saying for you to some degree because you're a professor and you have that whole you know that whole world at your fingertips in some sense and you've been poor jon very successful at that but in the more specifically religious domain the more specifically christian domain you two are having some some public success what are you doing right do you think i'll let jonathan go first i say i think you know i think bishop barren and i are are doing very similar things which is why i've always felt akin to what he's doing i've written for his for one of his publications i always felt we're close in the approach which is first of all a avoiding just argumentation but but rather this kind of presentation of beauty uh you know bishop barren also even in his publications and this desire to kind of have a beauty first approach this kind of encounter with these powerful patterns of being and you know how they kind of point to christ and i think that showing the deep coherence the deep narrative coherence in in scripture and then pointing back out to the world and saying this deep coherence in scripture you're going to encounter it in movies and in all these cultural phenomena that you're going to see you're going to encounter the same deep patterns that you find in scripture at a lower level we could say but that all of these kind of culminate into and so it really is like a meaning first approach and a beauty first approach i think which is which is which is attracting people because the insights they get at first they can't i have people who watch my videos for two years and tell me they don't understand what i'm saying and i'm like well why are you watching my how can you've been watching my videos for two years if you don't understand and they seem to express that they get these insights and they can't totally explain them and and then it keeps them kind of wanting to to continue on in in on this path let's say towards ultimately a lot of them end up moving towards christianity and entering a church at some point see i think jonathan's um what what bishop barren has been doing online has been a little bit more standard in terms of late modern apologetics church instruction and again i'm not criticizing it there there are a lot of ways in which i look at what bishop barren has been doing and i think wow i wish i could do it like him because some of what he does is just so good in another sense i think what peugeot said to john vervecky in that at the beginning of that conversation that they had is also true that um things are moving on and i see this i see justin briarley taking the turn i think justin briarley has really been taking the turn and seeing this is entering a new phase and i think probably for bishop barren watching jordan peterson getting an eye on you know knowing bit more and more and being introduced to john vervecky he's he's a very smart man i mean please all the stuff i've said here does not take away from his the the vast respect i have for him just as a roman catholic priest because you know in some ways any old any old dope can slide in to be a protestant minister in some ways and a lot of dopes do um you know he's got skin in the game i mean he's a bishop and and there's a there's a there's a lot of respect that i have for someone who reaches that level and his academic credentials what he's done with his channel again i mean when you when people listen to me they're always taking shots at bishop barren by no means yet what's happening here is new and important and it's going to take a while for people to begin to recognize it because again the world is changing and you know peterson and jonathan peugeot and vervecky in this little corner on the internet we're we're kind of at the cusp of it and so for for people deep within institutions hierarchies bind and blind and it'll take them a little while to sort of figure it out and then they've got a whole institution i mean people watch my channel they think oh what what must sunday morning be like well sunday morning is for a church mostly people over 80 i'm not going to talk about these kind of things with them not directly the little stuff will get put into it but you know in in some ways i need to bury my church before i can move on in some ways and but you'll see that in my adult sunday school class i'll put little things in because that's i i know as a pastor this is the pace you need to go and you know what we're doing on youtube right now this is all just very experimental and very different yeah my thing has been beauty and truth i mean so don't dumb it down i live through dumbed down catholicism and it was a pastoral disaster you look at all the surveys i studied them very carefully why young people are leaving the scandals come up the scandals will be mentioned but by far the most prominent reason is i don't believe the doctrines i never had my questions answered it's in conflict with science it doesn't make sense there and and that's very much closer to what audrey assad is saying in the justin briarley conversation and and one of the things i respect about justin briarley always have is that he lets people have the conversation he's not there trying to you know correct or control you know audrey assad he's just he's just listening to her and so you know i think justin has taken the turn quicker and so okay so the the orthodox and the catholics have maintained their sacraments and maintained their beauty and maintained their art protestants struggle with that but protestants have other you know protestants have other gifts and skills that we bring into this too and it's a very big very live space intellectual problems well yeah i get it we dumbed the project down for about 50 years so smarten it up and and reintroduce people to this tradition we've been talking about the second thing is the beautiful we also as we dumbed it down we also uglified it you know we we de-emphasized the beautiful so one example you know we put out this word on fire bible so the text of the of the gospels but it's a bit like an illuminated manuscript idea that we surrounded it with glosses from the fathers and the popes and the great theologians but also lots of artwork lots of color so i want to reintroduce people to the bible but not in a flat rationalistic way you know so that's what i've been trying to do i well i was certainly attracted to jonathan to begin with because of the quality of his artistic endeavor like this absolute he's absolutely beautiful everybody's attracted to jonathan your hair and scalp can't take the heat the fact is head and shoulders ocean lift with sea mineral essence formula keeps your scalp and hair invigorated and 100 flake free through the hottest summer days brought to you by our friends at symbolic memes and archaic endeavor like this absolute he's absolutely beautiful and archaic yeah traditional let's say not archaic traditional this traditional uh medium that he was revitalizing and in such a stunningly beautiful way and that's that that was the entry point into getting to know him and getting to understand his thought and yeah and beauty isn't the thing better than those churchmen telling jordan what to believe their dogma and their doctrine you can't argue against today beauty just smacks you and and and and that's really something so and you can also help people notice that it's like well notice beauty book beauty brooks no argumentation right what do you think that signifies what's it pointing to is it pointing to something higher it certainly seems to what might be higher we need to figure that out well it's the least threatening of the transcendentals in the post-modern context so people today you say here's something that's true and i loved this point okay so all of you who think i hate on bishop baron i loved this point this was big points for baron who you gotta tell me what's true i got my own truth even worse here's the way you ought to live here's the good who are you to tell me how to live but the beautiful doesn't preach in that negative sense it it just is you know it shows itself so it's more winsome and it's a more it's a less threatening way into the project so that's why i've tried to lead with it especially in a world that's ugly like our world is just so you know modern the modern world is just so banal that you know there's a reason why tourists go to cities and visit churches even though they're not christian and they don't care about it because they go someplace and they're looking for a beautiful for beauty and then they end up in a church rather than in a mall yeah and that's definitely worth thinking about you know and the intent incredible value that's to be found in those unbelievably beautiful beautiful constructions it's like what is that beauty and why do we experience it there those those lattice like creations of stone and crystal with color and the addition of the music that all goes to your liturgical point the drama that's part of that and and and the celebration of beauty which is definitely absent in the modern culture yes yeah when i was a student in paris i'd go there all the time and shard to me is the most beautiful covered space in the world uh but i remember this years ago i brought a classmate of mine so a priest from chicago to see shart and we walked through and i explained everything we looked at the windows and all this another good story by barron see he gets points later in the game and he said gosh it's something uh it's just too bad it's so liturgically off and i knew what he meant because i was forming the same way you know that i know the church would be in the round so we could see each other and there should be clear sight lines and you know should be brightly lit and all this stuff and like you said shard cathedral is liturgically off is like it's the supreme liturgical space in the world but that shows the the quality of the bad quality of the formation that we got in my generation um my experience with christianity has been different um and um so i was brought up in a fundamentalist christian family family um and so uh i very much was traumatized by that and um i think if you talk to some of the nuns and oh nes's uh i think there's a mixture like you said i don't think the scandals which the media likes to focus on are not the primary factors right not what the research shows one is this issue about intelligibility and i want to talk about that and the other is there i i meet a lot of people are attracted to my work because they because they've had similar histories uh not just specific to christianity i'm not beating up on christianity i've had people coming out of other traditions islamic buddhist this is possible um in all of uh the of all of the traditions i've encountered so i i think uh what there's two things i want to say and they're not intended to be pushed back but now you can find on youtube my initial conversation i had with john vervecky who's john vervecky and what is the meaning crisis what he shared with with sam here on sam's channel i thought was really moving and pertinent to the conversation of the four horsemen um so i mean i encountered playdo i'd gone through a sort of my own i'd left a fundamentalist christian upbringing um and became sort of a virulent almost sam harris kind of uh or at least maybe richard dawkins i think maybe sam is softening over time uh richard dawkins uh kind of militant atheist uh but the hunger i had for um deep connectedness um so for all of the ways in which my religious upbringing i think it's fair to say traumatized me it also left a taste in my mind uh for something larger than myself deeper than myself and then when i read playdo in the first year of university and i encountered the figure of socrates and i read the republic which is one of the most expansive of playdo's dialogue and i just fell in love with it um so i continued on with philosophy but um after you get past sort of first year philosophy even though the word philosophy contains the word wisdom literally in it um the topic of wisdom falls off the table and so i pursued academic philosophy because i got an interest in you know epistemology and metaphysics for their own sake the meta science philosophy of science became really important to me um and so i continued on but that hunger for uh wisdom was not properly uh being addressed um they're intended to open up questions which is uh and this is for john and that i also uh we rub up against each other but it usually creates a good friction and good sparks um and and maybe uh it'll call forth a response for you too bishop um i think the project is not to try and resurrect um neoplatonism or the neoplatonic structure i mean acquaintance sorry augustine wasn't only uh you know taught by ambrose he explicitly talked about you know platonist and the platonists and the mystical experience the neoplatonic mystical experience he had and how important that was etc and it's clear that it's through pseudodionysis and maximus and so i like um and so i think the project if i were to put it if we wanted to reach the nuns is to show them a reconciliation a profound one and here my ambition runs not personally but the ambition of the project now towards aquinas or maximus which is to show right to revise that neoplatonism and perhaps it's a neoplatonic christianity but i'm not going to be specific about that right now to show how it is profoundly uh you know to do a reciprocal reconstruction between the neoplatonism and the scientific worldview and there's a lot of people doing that right now i think we need we need a post-nominalist neoplatonism if i could put it that way in a profound john you you opened that that uh selville with the statement that you were traumatized by the fundamentalist christianity yes very much and that that's that's not irrelevant to the selville and and and to the nature of your project and and it's something we should discuss too because you also brought up the idea of reconciliation it's so people have left the church but in some sense the church has alienated people from it as well and some of that's the scandal and some of it's the sort of experience that you described yes people have been left with with the horrors of childhood experience that were a consequence of their religious education and i'm not trying believe me i'm not trying to attack the institutions per se but but it's again there's a hole in the culture where the church used to be and i think jordan and john are feeling that and they're watching the collapse there is no institutional structure in the culture that is functioning for the culture as a whole something that they need to deal with that needs to be dealt with it all of us need to deal with not they there's no they here you know what i there's no they here we have these problems we have this meaning crisis it's everyone's problem so it's there's no they in some sense but but so what has that done to you let's say with regards to your appreciation of christianity per se well first of all i want to say that those two things that we talked about the one that bishop barron brought up about and my response to it is i think we need and maybe jonathan will have a response because he has this model of christianity going through a resurrection cycle itself so maybe there is a possibility for our discussion but i think we need to i think we need a reciprocal reconstruction we need a post-nominalist form of neoplatonism that will provide that bridging and i do not think jordan that the lack of that is unrelated to the trauma that i experienced because of there was no bridge take that apart exactly okay because there was no bridge it was easy to give me an either or isolating choice you're either in this world view or you're in that world view and that one's demonic and if you go over there you're lost there is a deep connection between the lack of bridge between the religious world view if i can put it that way and the scientific world view that allowed for that kind of tyranny over my mind that i found so deeply traumatizing those are not separable phenomena that's what i'm arguing they are deeply interpenetrating and mutually supporting it's generally seen as quite a quite a fundamentalist in the sense of particular although i will say in england and australia i think it's gone to a more extreme direction than typically is the case here but there are those tendencies here and because those because it's an anti-hierarchical denomination they're pretty autonomous from each other these assemblies as they're called here so you could have an end right there you see some of the back and forth of is a hierarchy what we want we want control so we can make sure we don't have local aberrations or do you want do you want it to be non-prescriptive so that it's um or anybody can do and as i listen to conversations both in the church space and also in sort of the rebel wisdom john verveke space well there's sort of a there's sort of a there's a there's a real fear about a hierarchical prescriptive path but these things always have their their upsides and downsides have a very different experience from one to the next which i'm super aware of because i have friends that grew up in that that had a very different experience than i did because the culture of that particular gathering was different because it doesn't have there's no bishops and you know there's no pope it's it's a uh similar to a quaker type of spirituality in that way and um and in other ways as well but so that's where i was raised and so there's a small fundamentalist cult-like upbringing which i'm now aware you know after having done years of work to try to untangle the angst i have felt over religion and spirituality a lot of it starts with that with that upbringing and i remember in particular just being terrified all the time of everything you know like um uh it was remarkable when i've you know john has spoken about his upbringing in other places and the the parallels between some of what i heard audrey assad say and and some of what um john has said because again for me i was raised in a deeply religious household and my father was a pastor my grandfather is a pastor and you know i was raised in a house where exploration and pursuit of the truth and discovery was these these these these were what we these were what we did and and we were never in fear that that jesus wouldn't be on the other end of it and of physical affection let's say i was so scared of that i mean i read my journals i i have all these journals from when i was in middle school and high school and i would write things about how you know holding hands leads to kissing which leads to you know what and you can't ever do that and it's bad and i definitely internalized things in a certain way and i'm not going to blame that on the people teaching me i think it was a mix of what was taught and my particular temperaments and i also now know that i have been managing ocd my whole life which i didn't know at the time and so i was sort of diagnosed with this form of ocd called scrupulosity or religious ocd about five or six years ago and that really casts a lot of light and illumination on my relationship to faith because i i i don't think it's easy for me to operate independently of that tendency so organized religion for me always carried a challenge around not being able to um be terrified of hell and doing the wrong thing you know hurting hurting someone hurting god did your kind of experience of christianity ever kind of turn into something more grace-filled i mean i know you you eventually kind of took a journey towards catholicism could you could definitely and i would say currently i still have a relationship to christianity i mean i don't think there's a way for me not to do that and i don't desire to not have a relationship to it actually when i and i'll say more about this later but when i announced that i'm not currently practicing that that is the material truth of it i don't mean to say that i hate it or that i could never practice it again or that i hate jesus because i honestly don't think any of those things are necessarily the truth um but i am where i am partially because i need to be here it's sort of well i guess wholly because i feel that i need to be where i am and that's how i experienced it and what opened me up was a science fiction book that showed was a book by rogers elasny lord of light that showed the possibility of wonder and self-transcendence within a scientific worldview that's what blew me open out of fundamentalism yeah well lots of people who are followers of scientism let's say find their religion in science totally totally that's where literature grabs them right that's that's where they're grabbed by the religious and i mean star wars is the classic example of that for sure definitely so and that's you know that's worth pointing out to these these rationalist atheists that's fascinating to me fun when i deal with atheists online which i do a lot um very often i'd say when you scratch the surface of a really angry atheist you'll find as you put it a traumatized fundamentalist at first that surprised me now it doesn't anymore that when i press a little bit and probe a little bit it's someone recovering from just the kind of traumatizing experience that you had as a kid so i that makes sense to me yeah i want to be clear i i wouldn't self identify as an atheist that would no no i wasn't jesting that no but but i think just to your point that i understand that the severe reaction to it that people would have did you what did you think of the point that i made that there's a deep connection between sort of the the psychological trauma and the fact that it was facilitated by this gap uh yeah right religion and science that is very much the enlightenment grammar that we've been given right and and let's see what i find attractive about the neoplatonic tradition was the idea of rationality and the mystical being deeply interpenetrating but we can't leave it as it was is what i well i'm sure i think we it needs a fundamental uh reorganize but but and it needs to connect to this fun there's a there's a huge thing happening in science at least the science that i that i'm aware the fundamental ontology is coming into question the way we have seen since the beginning of the 20th century there's a golden opportunity here there's a golden what do you see happen do you how do you say your relationship is now to the person of christ audrey um you know you've spoken a little bit about about god kind of not being quite such a hard and fast um being as such you know giving commandments and laws and so on where do you put christ in that so several years ago i got very interested in quantum physics and of course i'm a lay person i'm not a physicist i don't really have a sophisticated understanding of quantum physics but it's very interesting to me so i read a lot about it because one of the questions i always lived with um as a christian as a child was like how am i communicating to god and how am i communicating to jesus like what does it mean that he's everywhere what does that mean practically i don't understand how that's possible we don't believe in ghosts you know we wouldn't call jesus a ghost um how is it possible for a god and a man to permeate not only space and time but like all of space and time i think there's a ton of god number one god number two maybe i'll do a separate video on it in this conversation i thought this was one of the more helpful um reconstruction deconstruction sorry i don't i've chris foley made a um you know like one of the comments i made about this on twitter so i don't i don't mean to dis chris foley in that and um but it the some of the parallels of this deconstruction conversation with the other conversation i thought were i thought were noteworthy i mean what do you what do you see because you're far-seeing so i want to know like what is it oh boy i don't know i want to take that but thank you for that um well what i see is this i see i see that we are there's we're moving back to the understanding uh that we need the emanation with the emergence not throwing out the emergence but we need the emanation with it for let me just see you give you one example so when you in cognitive science even in biology we are getting to the point and and and you know aristotle would like this um and maybe even more uh platinus where we we we understand possibility as a real thing so for example right and this this lines up with some eastern traditions so i'll do this sometimes i'll put a pencil on the table and i'll roll it and this goes to like cutting edge work by alicia aurora was honest my students why did it roll and they give the standard sort of newtonian answer because you pushed it right and then i'll say think think think what are you not seeing think thinking what i said it also rolled because there's a flat table and there's open space in front of it and it has the shape that it has there are in addition to causal events there are constraining conditions that are just as real and they are as much explanatory of how things operate as the bottom up causes so think of a tree you have all of the events causing the structure but the structure why does the tree have the structure it has because it increases the probability that a photon will hit a chlorophyll uh molecule it's structuring possibility into potentiality and that's just as much needed to explaining a tree as the chemical events causing it we need both to explain life to explain cognition and more and more people like eastman's work there's a lot of people from sort of the white hedian philosophy of physics are saying we need that even for our fundamental physics because we can't reconcile bottom up quantum mechanics with top down relativity we can't do it because and we keep trying to make it it's got to come from quantum up to the relative the relativistic which is you know top down but i would argue the fact that we've tried this strategy and we keep trying it for 40 years and it's failing is probably a reason to think that maybe we're framing the problem fundamentally wrong way and we have to think about no no no we have to give up a purely bottom up we have to make the top down as real to all of our explanations that's happening in the science right now now to my mind and i don't mean to be insulting because i don't want to be reductionistic but that sounds a lot like a lot of the language i hear jonathan using and i agree jonathan it's not identical but you and i have good conversations around this there's a we can talk to each other there's a there's there's you know a chance of real communication even communing but that i don't think that's specific to us i think that's a very real possibility right here right now it has to there's an opening up of the and and i think what what jon says there is exactly right because when i you know now when i go back and i look at some of the videos that we made when we first just met when we first just started i listened to jon and you know jon has changed and i have changed and jonathan has changed and so you know that's the dia logos now again i think there's a there's a fear in some communities that oh no what what's you know is is jon gonna lead paul out of christianity i don't think so i think um um is paul gonna lead jon into christianity well i hope so well we'll see if it's it'll be a neo platonic sort of christianity if he comes back in the fold but but i you know when when it comes to the question of what jordan peterson was asking and what he wasn't seeing in the church was a degree of movement and again there's going to be risk but if there's anything i know about the christian god he's a risk-taking god yeah i say that as a calvinist um but that's that's part of how the narrative plays out you send jesus into this world as an infant i mean we're just starting the the christian new year advent you send jesus into this world as an infant um and you know deconstruction yeah but you have to you have to follow you have to you have to play through the story you have to let the narrative unfold the space very real possibility right here right now there's an opening up of the space that's happening now and and i think people who are tuned to it can notice it and it does have to do with what you're saying in terms of this kind of limit of science and the problem of the observer and all of these realities that everybody's trying to deal with uh and it's like it's almost like a zeitgeist and it's interesting because your experience you talked about of being traumatized and then having this separation of the two world views it really is akin to the way i was trying to describe at the outset yes in a separation between let's say the religious in a very in a very kind of moralistic and legalistic and and uh you know materialistic way and this kind of rise up above of these esoteric things that kind of came up in the west whether it goes into theosophy into all these different very very popular you know all the occultists all of this stuff was very very oh no no jonathan's camera is not jonathan you've got pretty good equipment to get a camera that focuses get a sony very popular we we tend to ignore that but it was extremely uh had a lot of effect on culture and so that's why it's interesting because some people today to me will say things like oh you're you're saying occult things because because i'm actually trying to connect reconnect these things together right to reconnect these things that went up too high and these things that went too low into this top down bottom up reality when you read sam max with the confessor you really do have exactly that structure that you're talking about and and i think that can if you read san gregor of nissa and especially the mystical like the more mystical fathers i think that like you talked about pseudodionysius i there are some theologians right interesting theologians right now that are positing dionysus's theory as a solution to the problem of complexity and emergence and they don't want to come out of my channel yet because they're still working on their papers but it's happening right now like people are talking about it and thinking about it yes can i suggest something this comes from uh cardinal george of chicago who was kind of a mentor to me and he was a brilliant guy and he used to say we we start the religion science thing the wrong way because it's too much a polar opposition that we should now i think it's helpful that i don't know who cardinal george is but cardinal george from chicago he's obviously a churchman and and and that's where again i make my plea for the lament that jordan you know has has left the ground as it were as a university professor as a clinical psychologist and that's been disrupted by this the crazy thing that he's been on but just wanted to make that point the religion science thing the wrong way because it's too much a polar opposition that we should work on the recovery of philosophy as a rational path and what i think he meant was a lot of people especially young people think the only rational path is the scientific one those are simply coterminous to be rational is to be a follower of the scientific method and so if religion isn't that well then it must be irrational well if it introduced philosophy as indeed a rational path that the most brilliant people in the tradition have have uh have practiced it but it's not a scientific path it's it's rational without being scientific and that might open the door cardinal george used to say to thinking about religion is also a rational path that's not scientific i think it's hard for younger people to even to imagine what that is rational means scientific we we can we can we can help them out to some degree i mean i titled my first book maps of meaning for a very specific reason is that the this narrative structure is a map yeah this and that what that means if that's true and i do believe it's true and i studied a lot of the early work on hippocampal function from animal animal researchers and they they made some real fundamental discoveries in the field of cognition it's like we we need a map to traverse the world it's not optional without a map you're lost and to be lost is is a terrible thing and so and and there's rationality in the development of a map there better be because otherwise it doesn't get you to where you want to go and you certainly want to get away from being lost let's say and science is not a map it's a description of the terrain without direction yeah there's direction there i suppose but it's implicit the scientists impose that direction by following the dictates of their intuition of meaning but science and i also think there need to be guides there there are maps but there needs to be guides and those those guides are going to be right right there's no rationality outside of science okay well they let the irrational people design the map well that's what's happening with the politicization of our culture right right so the religion and then the rationalists you know they say well if there's a hole in the culture where the church used to be and i think that's exactly what jordan is talking about right there we weren't religious and we weren't superstitious well everyone would be rational it wouldn't the world be a better place and i think no the religious would drop into the political and then you watch what happens and we are and that's what's the caving into into the hole watching what happens because there's no domain for the religious now no specified domain so tiny things become imbued with religious significance because there's no proper place right and that's it that's not good and so it's not that it's not impossible i mean i don't see i don't see a flaw in this claim i can't see a flaw and it's like don't we need a map well can science provide that map i've never heard a thoroughly critical scientifically trained deep philosopher make the case that science can provide the direction for ethical behavior and that's the map what's good where should we head so well then what do we do with that there's nothing there's nothing there's no map no and that's why i objected so much to that claim that that science belongs in the highest place that's not the physical sciences are the queen of the sciences that can't be right because that's that's saying the one that can't provide the map is governing all the other ways of knowing and that can't be right but i think we have lost a sense of that and again i think as a religious person i'll take some responsibility i think we have not been great at providing the map and we have to recover that for sure well bichette i i i i think this follows from what you and jordan were talking about one of the problems about invoking philosophy is is which one do you mean do you mean academic philosophy or you mean the philosophy that pierre haddo i know has has brought back where that one i think is better yeah the it's a way of life well yes now i revakia's said it many times and usually if i'm in the middle of a conversation um it's uh there was this really nice article in first things on what is ancient philosophy by benjamin ballant and um i i hadn't had hardly any introduction to haddo and and i thought it was a it was a very it was very very interesting read and so um you know lovely to have john verveke prompt me to learn more things and what i would what i what i would point to is that that points us to a kind of what are we what's the difference between the academic philosophy and i have training in that and philosophy as a way of life and it goes to you know points that jonathan was making about you know the trend the how much the transformation look the the cartesian claim is that truths all truths are available to a method if you go to earlier you know the neoplatonic tradition right there it's like no no no there are some truths that will only be disclosed if you go through fundamental transformation and then and then so we have to talk about the the rationality of transformation which is about you know the procedural the perspectival the participatory transformation and you know what he said there is so helpful in that i'll just play it again because it's it's worth listening i have to listen to things multiple times to get it through my skull and the you know the neoplatonic tradition about you know the how much the transformation look the the cartesian claim is that truths all truths are available to a method right there all truths are available to a method think about the implications of that assertion and just just think about it in in normal terms can you know what it's like to grow up in audrey assad's plimoth brother brother in church how about the little community where john vervecki grew up there's that's so so there's a degree to which standpoint epistemology which gets a lot of press because of some of the culture war stuff you have to acknowledge its point you also have to see its limitations they're both there but that's wisdom to get down to that to get down to that level go to earlier you know the neoplatonic tradition right there it's like no no no there are some truths that will only be disclosed if you go through fundamental transformation and then and then so we have to talk about the the rationality of transformation which is about you know the procedural the perspectival the participatory transformation and the thing about this and this is what's really exciting is a lot of the work is showing that you know i've got a series of right now with gregory kirsten zack stein that you you can't infer your way through transformation this goes to i mean the person who wrote the book on this is la paul i know lori she's a great philosopher tight analytic argument to make the point you can't infer your way through a transformative process and so you have to ask the question okay is it just willy nilly now what do human beings actually do what kind of rationality agnes callard did this in her book on aspiration she calls it proleptic rationality what kind what is the rationality what does it look like when people are you know going through fundamental transformations in order to conform to reality that's their way of getting at the truth rather than marshaling a method and so it is i go back to my point again we need to expand the notion of rationality and the way it was exemplified in phyllo in phyllo sofia rather than the way it is exemplified i would say in still to a large degree academic philosophy i went into yeah i agree can i invoke your the academic philosophers have the same problem that bishop barron described about the priesthood yeah that's how it looks could i invoke your to me your countryman again uh lonergan you know we had those four imperatives if you want to know the world you've got to be attentive be intelligent be reasonable and be responsible and he describes all four of those but his point was we tend not to be those four things the mind is fallen it falls away from attention it doesn't see what's there or even like john to use your stuff it doesn't maybe make the right um siphoning moves to say let me be attentive to the right things it's not intelligent which for him meant it doesn't have insights so it doesn't discern intelligible form it's not reasonable meaning it doesn't make judgments so i'm looking at a phenomenon i say it could be this could be this could be that but i never make the judgment to say no that's that's truly what this thing is and then finally it's not responsible meaning it doesn't follow up the implications of its judgments but what he was getting from his own christian tradition i think was the deep sense of the fallenness of the mind the mind is it's it's not it's not a wreck but it's compromised and it needs to go through a disciplinary process it has to go and that's i think what pierre adot and those people are recovering from the ancient world is you had to go through plato's academy was not a classroom where you sit and take in play time plato's theory of the forms it was a way of life and you learned a manner of of being and knowing and so on so i this this that first things article on pierre hadot it should come as no surprise then that the philosophers of antiquity from pros from pre-socratic to the late neo-platinists flourished in tight communities of shared dialogue and practice the stoic age seneca councils that the living word and the life in common will benefit you more than the written discourse and i think this is true of the youtube you can watch youtube channels all you want but but you have to somehow be in dialogue in dialogue in conversation it's in this it's in this meeting each other and finding each other where where things begin to change inside of us when transformations occur the stoic sage seneca counseled that the living word and the life in common will benefit you more than the written discourse and his contemporaries indeed tended to think together and to think think out loud for aristotle as for others hado said the discussion of problems was ultimately more formative than their solution membership in a philosophical school until not doctrinal allegiance but as hado put it the choice of see and see when we set that up as such i don't think that helps us because in some ways if you take this idea it becomes a doctrine itself and and and this on on one hand modernity is an is an overreaching of the of the propositional and it hence in then in its in our reaction to it we get allergic to the propositional whereas what we want is the proper calibration of the propositional within the rest of the knowing ways membership in a philosophical school until not the doctrinal allegiance but as it all puts it the choice of a certain way of life an existential option which demands from the individual a total change of lifestyle a conversion of one's entire being and ultimately it is a certain desire to be and to live in a certain way and so when you look at how do you keep the politician from corruption being present in the philosophical realm or in the in the political realm will tend to lead to will tend to lead to corruption there needs to be another factor and force in that individual's life where it's just politics just you know screw it i'll take the money no bigger things are at stake that formation needs to come from someplace else and right now there's a hole in the culture and peterson's way has a degree of you need that formation in people but that formation probably isn't just going to happen willy-nilly out there in the culture if this strikes you as closer to religion than philosophy you're then thinking like an early christian for far from rejecting pagan philosophy hado notes christianity borrowed from it extensively ultimately deriving its very conception of itself from greek thought the fledging religion presented itself not only as a philosophy in the ancient sense of the term but as the philosophy if doing philosophy meant living in conformity with reason the thinking the thinking went if it really presents a conversation of one's entire being then christians were philosophers and at least some philosophers christians hence we find the apologist justin for example declaring scarcely a century after jesus that those who before christ led a life accompanied by reason are christians even if they are known as atheist such as socrates heraclitus and and those like them hado further argues that the first christians annexed from philosophy not only large swaths of ancient ideological landscape but also many of its spiritual practices and early christian exercises aiming to instill virtues such as peace of mind and absence of the passions in tradition of contemplative monasticism as developed by such fourth century church fathers as basil of caesarea gregory of nyssa and gregory in a story um nazianza non-zianzin hado detects a strong whiff of greek philosophical practice hado admits that these exercises formed part of the broadier ensemble of practices which were specifically christian still though the philosophy the christian philosophers tried to christianize their use of secular philosophical themes they could not help describing their further spiritual exercises by means of vocabulary and concepts of secular philosophy the heart of hado's argument lies in his contention that in the process of digesting it christianity slowly but inexorably broke philosophy apart the ancient schools and for this reason there's there's sort of a sense in which philosophy ends in the classical period and re-emerges in the modern period because you have the sense that there there's especially the modern sense that the the church inside the hole is collapsing the ancient schools that had not disappeared platonism and aristotelianism in particular removed from the ways of life that inspired them were reduced to the status of mere conceptual material which could be used in theological controversies philosophy made to serve theology became merely theoretical aristotelian logic and ontology for example furnished concepts that were indispensable for the formation of the dogmas of the trinity and incarnation but christianity itself a pervasive way of life had little use for the practical elements of ancient philosophy other than those that chose to appropriate so when philosophy emerged many centuries later in its own again to breathe the air of the enlightenment it considered itself a theoretical science because the existential dimension of philosophy no longer had any meaning from the perspective of any meaning from the perspective of christianity and so it was hadow concludes that philosophic that philosophy stripped of its conceptual content became the impoverished thing it is today and i think that then goes right into you can read the whole article i'll have to remember to put the link in the video um you can see both christianity sort of absorbing philosophy and then in the enlightenment when when you want to have something that re-emerges it's this desiccated theoretical thing that we sort of have left with in modernity now a terrific video that most of you haven't watched a good many of you have a you know nate's channel only has you know 163 subs so you can get in below the 200 mark there you go um this terrific conversation on go to science and so and sophiology with john vervecky and michael martin and this this whole video was just a wonderful video um i want to play i want to play part of it where can i get in where can i where's a good place to jump in here socially damaging so so martin is an interesting guy i don't know a lot about him nate's been really pushing him on me a lot um and so hopefully we'll have a conversation he's he's got both a foot in academia but also in sort of the waldof community which is those of you know my wife teaches in a waldof school so i've got some familiarity with that but so then he's into the bio-organic farming and he's got a lot of children and so and there's a bunch of reasons why nate heil you know wants to sort of shift the two of us but i thought this i haven't read michael martin's book um i was not terribly familiar with it and there's just so many conversations to follow but this one this one really caught my eye and really grabbed my imagination partly because of goethe who's a very interesting figure you know rudolph steiner another very interesting figure and of course barfield really went down the rudolph steiner route i mean there's some issues with steiner you know part of what peugeot was talking about in terms of this this 19 there's the there was this impoverishment in the 19th century at the height of modernity that things broke out in you know the rosa crucian there's this amazing rosa crucian museum in san jose which i visited a number of times under homeschooling our children just because you can see all the egyptian artifacts but you know a bunch of stuff just broke out in the 19th century in these areas it was just just way too much pent up um stuff that was way too suppressed and then it just breaks out and sort of all kinds of crazy forms but but the attempt to now okay reintegrate wisdom into the world down the line i have to assume is coming it's it is the mental health tsunami is coming it's already starting and it's coming and it's going to get worse um very much um the great resignation is in part a massive response to the way covid sort of made stark the meaning crisis for a lot of people in very powerful ways right and i think that for me i mean there was a crisis for meaning for us and that was that was a way to address it right is it the way to address it i don't know but it was a way to address it right i think i think paul van der klay's estuary project is also like pretty good which i've been in person fun to get estuary into it and if you get into the estuary host support network if i have that right john vandonk and and nate's been big into that involved in um i'm gonna be i'm gonna be hosting an estuary group at my church uh starting in december yeah i'm personally i'm lucky enough to be part of a very small anglican church that that like tolerates here here for small churches again i i want to give mega churches their due in their place but there's experiments that you can do in a small church that you'll never be able to do in a mega church it's my hot my very my very open heterodox kind of meanness so it's not really it's not really a problem for me uh so i have and it's a very small close community so i'm lucky in that way but i'm also very hyper aware of like how other people have this need to be connected to this and i think what paul is doing with with estuary um is actually a really good move in that in that direction that's a good point because like in practice because since i've been participating in it through the like the the estuary host conversations like it has a lot of resemblance as to kind of like what goes on in a to a certain degree right which is actually like i think there's a lot for the church to learn from that and you don't have to be someone who suffers from drug addiction and and in many ways a is exactly what peterson was talking about at the cambridge union when it's listening to each other it's small it it it scales through multiplication of small things it's attention it's it's disciplined now it's you know a is supposed to be anonymous to a degree so you you're supposed to be able to go in there if you have an alcohol problem and not lose your job but yet there is discipline and and there is accountability and it's of a different kind where you know if you fall off the wagon yeah i mean i mean again look at look at chad the alcoholics um my conversation with chad the alcoholic or uh alcoholism to benefit from what a is doing or to have something that functions in that model that is open to anyone who wants to come it's a good thing so or or perhaps the eightfold path as an ecology of practices sure there's some preliminary evidence and so that's all it is but it is evidence nevertheless that rehabilitation programs based on the eightfold path model do better than the the 12-step model just generally and so i mean i think we should be really empirical really empirical and and in that sense scientific about the proposal of these well what causes the results of spiritual transformation so maybe more people are able for whatever for in my opinion i think it's spiritual transformation that is actually whatever whatever it is that people agree they're coming into contact with spiritual transformation through a or the eight full path or whatever whatever it is and the truth of the matter is we might need different models for different people i i that i think is highly plausible i think demographic pluralism is a reality and certainly if we're dealing with trauma um we we should have uh we we should we should have a rich repertoire of programs available for people i totally agree with that um but that again the that's a different we're now proposing a different kind of institutional structure than we have done typically in the past yeah typically we have here's our program sign on or get lost right uh and that um i i think we we have i i think uh there needs to be a lot more flexibility given uh the fact that we are now i think coming to accept um the significant differentiation between people how they come to um how do they come to the real possibility of transformation there's there's there's there's a lot of variation in how that happens and i think denying that the time for denying that has passed and um so that's interesting i should i should talk to paul more about that i i like the fact that there were people from there's a discord community that is set up around my work and my project and then paul's community and they have entered into i i just did paul and i did a thing together with bridging between them and they have entered into what i think could properly be called fellowship they they reinforce each other um they support each other they explore each other they challenge each other they self-correct or they correct each other and drive each other to self-correct i'm really really pleased with that i had nothing to do with that uh and that again speaks to me that there's a lot of people are are um i like this latin word inventio which means about to discover and make there's the inventio of these new ways and it's just popping up all over the place and again the fact that the mainstream media and our political machinery is completely indifferent and blind to this the fact that they can't even like they won't even describe the great resignation as the great they're starting to now but for a long it was a labor shortage like no no no people are doing there's not some abstract lack of a resource there's right there's there's a lot there's millions of people basically saying we want more meaning and more importantly we're willing to take a hit in our standard of living if it gives us the promise of more meaning yeah and they're not paying attention to that they're not paying attention to that at all well i don't think they can i just don't think the structures allow for it it's just you could be right well and i think i think it's an impoverishment of education too i mean yes i think you know they haven't like you were talking about uh you know in fact when i taught philosophy at a catholic college the book i started in in my intro to philosophy course was haddow right philosophy is a way of life oh and because you know i noticed and i was teaching in a inner city catholic college mostly black students and they were totally into those questions yes yes they would just wow and waiting for somebody to ask me these things you know yes and so it was really and people are starving for it but i think you know so many of the people in you know they're probably in their 30s and 40s in education or in in journalism now they haven't had those questions they haven't had that that that grounding general because we haven't seen questions about personal transformation and meaning as as practical questions when they're the most practical questions that there really are yeah by gdp right um but i have a question a little off off topic but i was you know i know john your interest in neoplatonism very would you describe yourself as an platonist i describe myself as a post-nominalist neoplatonist okay i think there's i i don't i don't think we can just go back to the new right before i have a question then and because this touches on sociology what is your take on the world soul the idea of the world soul so uh i think it's um for me i take it that the universe is recursively self-organizing in a tremendously fractal and almost incomprehensible way and that is very much um i think at least the scientific analog of what the world soul was let me let me try and do it a little bit more right i i think i i'm a little bit not peeved people oh materialism is first of all they often confuse uh uh corp reality with materialism right which is is a mistake and then they confuse materialism with you know like well there's patterns patterns right scientists believe in patterns equals mc squared right and the thing about that is that's not an event that's not an object it's not located right here or there it's a real structuring of possibility that constrains how things emerge so i this is not my my neoplatonism is in this sense very much like erigina i think of a complete interpenetration of emergence and emanation and at all levels and this is a terrifically self-organized this expresses itself in a terrific uh you know a terrifically calm and i you know every time he says self-organizing i think what does that mean it's sort of it's i don't know it always strikes me as sort of fudgy because it's self-organized it basically means it organizes it organizes with the power that we can't account for that this is this is built into the system and then we're sort of back to his his conversations with uh with sam um on transformed that the the universe seems designed to do this plex and i think ultimately beautiful form of self-organization for me that's what's meant by the world's soul the universe in a sense is as much responsible for its its existence as anything else is if i can put it that way um i'm not saying i'm not arguing for pantheism what i mean is let me give you an analogy one of the things we're discovering and it's odd that it's becoming right as but as we adopt the idea of cognition is inherently dynamical and developmental is that you as a self-organizing thing play a big role in your development now i know that sounds like of course but it took a while to get there where we now and that's what i'm trying to say the universe plays a big role in its development which which seems to be nearly the definition of agency at multi-schedular levels and and so for me that whole vertical of emanation and emergence and the horizontal you know directing itself so john i can't hate when you say that i can't help but think of uh emile book the uh the anthroposophist whose text we've been we've been analyzing on my channel in one of in one of his discussions of revelation he he sees the 144 000 singing the new song in revelation as like as a participation in that co-creation of of the new heaven and the new earth yeah like there's a role to be played by by human consciousness in that yeah i mean one of the ways and yeah i think so i mean um one of the ways of responding to you know sort of a general statement i mean said in general about our sort of cosmological insignificance is to move from a quantitative analysis to a qualitative one right where we may be small causally but in terms of disclosing the possibilities of being we are really really important we are really really important such that i can say this without even a hesitation of thought do i want a universe with or without life with life there you go there's something because that that was easy and do i want do i want to right and do i want a universe with or without intelligent life again intelligent life why because right it there there there like there there's the capacity i'm not trying to make even a weak anthropomorphic argument here but right but there is the disclosure in us of being and in that sense i think we can participate in the sacred in a way that other things other beings can't and therefore we have a special responsibility i think that's part of what reverence is reverence is that first of all not how things are relevant to me how am i relevant to them and that does that relevance carry with it a sense of responsibility i think that's what reverence properly is and so i think our capacity for genuine reverence makes us qualitatively important to disclosing the possibilities of something like the world soul i don't i typically use that word but i'm using it because you introduced it michael like like just like sometimes this actually happens to me um and it's and it's an aesthetic experience but it's more than an aesthetic spirit i'll see a cat go by my my my partner has cats and she's really converted me i really love cats now i used to think of them as land sharks with brains but now right there's this one cat and he he's an amazing but the cat goes by and i think what and see how this is like the greek question about being but i asked what must the universe be like such that it can produce a cat like what that reveals something about it that isn't revealed in sort of the nuts and bolts of chemistry or even the nuts and bolts of of you know certain parts of biology and i would i would say he's seeing the glory of the cat what what is that glory it's it's tuned it's akin to the sacred but it's it's uh the sacred is sort of a a hushed withdrawal and the glory is just the bright shining etc there's something more that's being disclosed there and so that's my answer to you nate i i hope that made some sense so did michael did this address your question pardon me did this did my answer to address your question no i guess i was investigating your work i thought why don't we think about this because a lot of people do compare the idea of sophia to the world's soul and i thought it'd be a good point of intersection and um but i think what you're talking about you know this idea of disclosure that heider really talks about quite a bit right and but he also i mean i think heider and being in time often is a great model for this with this you know if you think in stages as first the being hurled towards death yes yes then the disclosure right when you when you finally drop all the persona and what come what arises from that for for heider he calls it care right yes and but but but reverence i think is is also an adequate term for that you know it's it's analogous to his idea of care because when you get to that place as a human being you you're in your uh your disposition towards the world has has changed and that's it that's it i mean like you like when when socrates is asking the what is question he's not asking you a question of curiosity he's not seeing like in curiosity your cup is half is half filled and you want to fill it up so that you can repair your knowledge but wonder is you empty your cup more right you empty your cup more what what it what is it what is it because he's trying there's often in the dialogues there's no answer precisely because there is no answer to be given what what you see you can see some of his interlocutors realizing is that what's being cultivated is right relationship right the right relationship to other people and the right relationship to being itself and so and i think again but here's my and that's not too far from loving god with all your heart soul mind and strength and loving your neighbor as yourself criticism of heidegger heidegger does this he talks it but there's nothing in heidegger about and this you know this is a hadou critique there's nothing in there about the practices right like what do you do i mean my friend geisenstadt created circling he created the whole and this has become a movement because he was trying to figure out how to put heidegger into practice right and so there was the that's a real problem uh that i also don't like heidegger's sort of heidegger builds a mystique around himself that i find very very off-putting um i'm the great thinker and i can never completely disclose my thoughts to you okay but i think he does offer a kind of practice in his writings on poetry which is where i first caught it right right right i saw where he was going oh in his writings in poetry no no no that's a very good point michael yeah yeah i i suppose i suppose then to me that's not trivial because poetry really is prayer like it just is like that that is exactly nate throws down is is categorical exactly what poetry is and it doesn't matter like what no matter what what's interesting is that different kinds of poems can be different kinds of prayers and lamont thank you thank you thank you help me help me help me i don't think it's great poetry nate yes so it's like like you know a buchowski poem is no less a prayer than a george herbert poem they're all an attempt to communicate with being and understand how and to understand how you relate to it and and heider and you know he's preoccupied with holderland right which is i think an important um um location because okay there's a there's a taste of of this of that video it was an excellent video i don't know if i'll i'll treat it more i gotta finish this video up because i'm not doing another episode on it i think that's true in in in any intellectual discipline you've got to be and you learned a manner of of being and and knowing and so on so i think that's true in in in any intellectual discipline you've got to be converted and you have to acknowledge and we have to acknowledge your sin in a way that your mind is is not what it should be and you got to go through a discipline well gentlemen we've we've we've passed our two hour mark and so um i think and i'm starting to drift and i've way past two hours somewhat so i'm going to call this to a halt i think somewhat arbitrarily unless there are pressing issues that any of you would like to conclude with maybe a concluding statement from each of you might be a nice thing jonathan put you on the spot do you want to say something to close up sure i mean i think that first of all jordan thank you for the opportunity for us to talk uh to speak to each other i never met bishop barron i i had some admiration for him and obviously for you and for john and um i think that these discussions are very fruitful and i think that these especially as people watch them it's because it's obviously not just happening here if people watch them get engaged and kind of people who haven't listened to john's things or haven't listened to bishop barron things are mine you know to kind of see what is what is the discussion happening now because a lot of the things we brought up are are really on fire in terms of subjects in the world and so need to be continuously explored and we need more people to to dive in and so thanks for the opportunity john i i i want to reinforce what jonathan just said it's been wonderful the two hours flew by for me uh it was wonderful to meet you bishop um and i think we could have some wonderful conversations in depth about um you know the project of now now part of you'll catch jon often say that part of he keeps you know i do these monologues and these commentaries but jon keeps mostly to yes to dialogue dialogos um for some reasons and so um it would be fun to listen to john and bishop barron um have a convo integrating neoplatonism and science i think lana grinn would be help and you know insight of course was crucial to that so i i i really appreciate all that um yeah i just wanted to say that um i take the meeting crisis very seriously um and i think covet has made it worse i've got a lot of evidence for that and um i don't think i think the the vein i think it's a vain hope that everything's just going to go back to the way it was i think that is not where we should place our existential or epistemic bets and i think we need to ramp up the project of getting the call to a sapiential framework in a way of life to people out there so that's what would be my final word yes ship yeah mine again is just to thank everybody i enjoyed it immensely and i agree with jon the time flew by and i found it fascinating um yeah the recovery of the wisdom tradition over and against this deadening scientism the recovery of value over and against this equally deadening culture of self-invention that i just generate my own values i think that i mean bores me to death and i think that no it bores me to death and i think it's killing people spiritually so the recovery of the wisdom tradition the recovery of objective value culminating speaking as a as a catholic bishop in uh in god the supreme value that's the key to meaning the dude could be succinct unlike some of the rest of us thanks very much guys for participating in this i really appreciate it and um i'm sure will i'm hope i pray all of that that we'll have a chance to converse again and that people who are listening um are benefited by this and that we do this immense technology that we have at our fingertips so surprisingly uh ethical justice and help help dispense whatever wisdom we've managed to cobble together to as many people as we possibly can and invite them along thanks god bless you all oops just missed it no them along thanks someone caught that on twitter it's interesting the two that did it and the two that didn't very very interesting anyway okay i've done it i've treated it i've pulled some other stuff in okay i've done it i've treated it i've pulled some other stuff in i hope it was helpful hopefully i'll get all the links below if i miss a link ask me in the comment section and i'll put it in and yeah this is part of the ongoing and and again it can't just be thinky talky it's you've got to do something you've got to be in relationship there there must be transformation and again to go back to to peterson um peterson at the at the cambridge at the cambridge union the transformation should be should not just be why can't i find it the transformation you know betterment proximal betterment is good but the proximal betterment has to scale all the way up and and peterson is sort of pointing at that with the the theoretical the theoretical witness to the the better the ultimate better but i i think again the hole in the middle of the culture left by the church has to address that so thus ends the commentary on this um will i do another one who knows will they do another one better question so thanks for watching leave a comment
