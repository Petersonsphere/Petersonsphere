 Hi, this is Paul. I get recommendations from a lot of you for a lot of things. Videos I should watch, thinkers I should look into, books I should read, and I appreciate that. The question of what I actually wind up watching or reading is quite a bit more mysterious even to me. I'll usually throw things on my blog or put things someplace and often depending on the source of who it came from the kind of thing that came to me it will either get picked up or not picked up and then if I pick it up and look at it either I'll look at it all the way or just skim it or just dive into it maybe it won't make an impact maybe it will this all gets into the subtle art of colonizing another human being. A colleague of mine, so I have obviously people out there in my internet community and on Bridges of Meaning Discord and friends I've made since I've started my YouTube thing yada yada yada but this is a ministerial colleague of mine sent me a recommendation on a podcast that kind of took me by surprise. A while ago I think perhaps at the recommendation of a tweet from Eric Weinstein I started following on Twitter Abilaji Srinivasan and I followed some of his tweets about COVID and some of these kinds of things and then this colleague of mine sends me a Tim Ferriss show podcast with Abilaji I hope I'm not saying his name wrong Srinivasan and it was sort of about Bitcoin which really took me by surprise because you know there's there's Bitcoin in my life in certain places but certainly not from this colleague and he made a comment to the effect of well this is all the stuff you're talking about and I thought how am I talking about any of these things and I've listened to most of the podcast I've skimmed through the rest of it just because I wanted to get this out because part of what makes it actually onto my channel usually has a great deal to do with what I'm thinking about at the moment and feeling like I want to talk about and want to process so on and so forth so where to begin because some of this stuff is so weird and so strange and I know some of my audience isn't anywhere near as nerdy as some other parts of my audience and I'm not going to try to explain what Bitcoin and and why they might be important for the future and fiat currency I mean that's really not the focus of this channel and I don't usually make videos about those kinds of things mostly because I don't feel I know much of anything to contribute about some of these kinds of things but here in this portion of the podcast I want to play he starts talking about what is essentially a strategy for living and just previous to the section I'm going to play he talked about now most of most of this advice seems to go towards young single people someone in my situation in life that has a family and people who depend on them and who is later in life some of this certainly might not apply but basically the advice that this individual is given giving is also sort of towards people who are very well-educated have a highly marketable skill that is that is in demand and can be worked at a distance and so his advice is basically get a job that makes a lot of money that you can work over the internet and then go move to some low-cost area that you want to live in and save all your money and by that way have it's sort of the poor man's f you money where you can have a degree of financial independence not because you've made a whole lot of money which is sort of the way we often think about it but because you spend very little money now again this is if your money spending is under your control which usually means your signal single once you're married you at least have 50% probably somebody else has a say over your lifestyle and where you live and how you spend your money and once you have children they pretty much take all your money unless you have a whole lot of money and on and on and on and on and on but really this section is about being cancel proof and being a square jawed Chad which well this will trigger some people in interesting ways but then he goes into a whole bunch of other really interesting things that actually had a great deal to do with the last monologue video I did on platforms and I do look at my analytics and yes videos that prominently involve Jordan Peterson always get way more views and videos that have cut over covers and titles that don't directly involve Jordan Peterson get far less views and if I'm talking about something nerdy like the church and theories about the church and structure and culture I love the comments on videos like that because you know many of you leave excellent comments but a vast majority of people not the vast majority but a lot of people who sort of keep a little eye on my channel don't come to the channel for that this guy obviously is very very smart he's one of the creators of Coinbase he's got he's sort of an inter he's sort of a he brings in thoughts about biology and society and technology and all kinds of things and so he's one of those kind of guys that are out there and he's fun to listen to and I'm sure some of you know way more about this guy than I know about this guy and some of you who have heard about this guy have opinions about this guy whether he's all wet or whether he's a guru or whether he's half-baked or who knows what but I'm gonna play a section here and do a little commentary on it that I thought was absolutely fascinating it gets both into the history of the church the Protestant and a whole bunch of things that I'm interested in and so you know kudos to my colleague I won't name you here who pointed this out to me but congratulations you've successfully colonized me sufficiently not only to listen to the podcast recommendation that you sent my way but to actually have it show up on my channel so I haven't yet checked the sound level so I should probably do that a minute just as a thought experiment let's say you're making I don't know a hundred thousand a year as an engineer and before you were in San Francisco and you're burning like 90,000 of that a year or something that's actually not insane a lot of people do exactly that right because the rent is so high now you go to some rule so this is basically where he's talking about how to maximize your income locale or even overseas and now you're actually only burning let's say 50k a year 40k in tax or have you and then like 10 or 20k let's say it's 60k okay 20k in expenses because you just cut it all the way down well now every year that you work you have basically built up because if your income goes away your taxes as well every year that you work up if you're if you're spending 20k a year you have 40k in savings if you just do out the math earn a hundred spend 60 bank 40 if you're spending is 20 then you have two years of personal runway added for every year that you work there in this now I should note that a lot of religious people have lived this way for a very long time because at least a big part of and especially religious people before the 20th century people who lived through the Depression enormous savers people who lived through uncertain times big savers and because part of their religion was sort of keeping a close watch on their appetite desires this is sort of how they lived so it's so funny how this is all new and shiny but I listen to it and I think it sounds like a lot of religious people there in this simple toy example and that means that you don't need to accept angel financing you can sell finance you can just for every year you work you can take two years off it's basically a way of getting personal financial independence like a deterministic path to doing so a few money basically but sort of in reverse of course you're no stranger to this you've been talking about this stuff forever you know the four-hour workweek and this is not this is not unusual for your audience but I think that the perhaps somewhat novel is connecting this to ideological independence because it means you can't be canceled you know you can just write it out like you know the square-jawed Chad yes you know from you know the memes I'm talking about no no I don't what is Chad I even knew what that was me and I'm by no means someone on the cutting edge of things okay okay this is very very online if you google the Chad yes it's like you know someone be like oh my god I can't believe you believe this or never and guys like yes and he's just not backing down at all just totally firm square-jawed Chad you never seen this no no it's all right I didn't know who Taylor Swift was until like four years ago so I'm a little I'm a little sheltered it would appear yeah it's like it's like it comes from you know yes Chad no you're me I'm here I'll send you the I'll put this in I'll put this in show notes for for people right next to drone warfare I bet 99% of your audience says I this is this is also part of the reason I like the local meetup which hasn't it's been dormant for a while because of COVID but it'll be fun to get going because it introduces me to all sorts of random things that I would never have bumped into if it weren't for all the crazy critters that go to the meetup and the bridges of mean discord server too maybe it's obscure maybe or maybe it's not I don't know but we'll have to see anyway point is how do you do the square-jawed Chad yes it means you have to be able to you know you're not backing down you accept what consequences may come because you have planned for the future now what's also interesting about this is part of the meaning crisis is the fact that we sort of fear we are not our own we begin to fear that we have been formed by propaganda we have been duped by systems this is what's so funny about post-modernity someone had just sent me a oh I should I just threw it up on my blog someone had just sent me it's kind of a contra points this is a trans woman who does philosophy talks on YouTube now and Jordan Peterson ideology and you know I in terms of her philosophy at least to the point of 23 minutes and I thought well this is this is really quite solid just kind of walking through phenomenology structuralism post-structuralism all of those kinds of ideas anyway how did I get over to there part of the meaning crisis is the idea that we are not our own and movies have been playing with this idea for a long time that we wake up one day only to realize we are a robot or we are programmed but but in our case we're programmed by the propaganda the propaganda that permeates everything and this actually is behind the idea of becoming awake or woke becoming you know suddenly now I see the truth I've been living a lie now again this is a this is an old religious this is an old religious theme this is what happens when I make videos I get random thoughts of other videos that I didn't make and slides are still hanging out there so maybe I'll bring it up hang out one of the very interesting connections about current culture war and history is the relationship between woke and awakenings because awakenings were this was the primary word used in the Puritan period about religious conversion Timothy Edwards was the minister father of in the colonial period probably the most prominent American philosopher and theologian of the time and some would argue of all of American history Jonathan Edwards and this is from Jonathan this is when from George Marsden's biography of Jonathan Edwards and Timothy Edwards Jonathan's father like many Puritan ministers was an expert in awakening so there's the first great awakening the second great awakening this article that I've referenced to I used in this in this video that I made I didn't actually make the video but some of you would might be interested in it this article that I use quite a bit I really love the thesis of this piece how the civil rights movement converted white liberal white Protestants to secularism he argues that in many ways the civil rights movement was another great awakening in American culture because these had been what were transforming American culture now Timothy Edwards following Puritan precedents emphasized three principal steps towards true conversion what does it mean to wake up and you know even even someone like Sam Harris riffs on this and the idea is that I'm a dormant robot and you know if we were to put these words and Brett Weinstein's transcending your assassin robot programming it all sort of maps on together and the Puritans were working on this quite consistently and programmatically for their lives and but only the first step is an awakening and at least in puritanical terms the awakening is to your bondage to this the devil and the world your bondage to well it's actually all three traditional enemies of the Christian your sinful nature the devil and the world so the first step is only the first step is awakening so Timothy Edwards following Puritan precedents emphasize three principal steps towards true conversion the first was conviction or an awakening sense of a person's sad estate with reference to eternity now obviously in the Puritan frame this has to do with one's vulnerability to the judgments of hell but in the age of authenticity it has everything to do with what if I'm not an autonomous self what if I am in fact just part of the gray people following along zombie fashion and I could pull up you know how many videos of people looking at phones this actually George Marsden pulls some of this stuff out from the 1950s because the idea was the company man and so another awakening that happens in the 60s is the counterculture where people wake up and release themselves from the shackles of working for IBM or something like this now again the meaning crisis is stalking all through this kind of thing because the idea is that I've been hoodwinked the matrix played riffs on this you're a prisoner of your mind you know what is the matrix you feel it when you go to church when you pay your taxes Morpheus says so the Puritans were you know working all all of this stuff within obviously within their own frame the term that Reverend Edwards used for this first but insufficient step was awakening we must notice that usage became we must notice that usage because awakening is the most common term used for the periodic outbreaks of religious enthusiasm in New England congregations and now this is interesting because people's idea of Puritans tends to be frozen-chosen stolid emotionless people in pews going through standard liturgies but if you look at the first great awakening there's all these breakouts of religious enthusiasm and people are crying and wailing and manifesting and you can find this stuff in you know Pentecostal circles today it's very interesting if you trace this stuff through American religious history but a mere awakening was no guarantee of salvation what do you mean by salvation it's regeneration it's promise of deliverance it's you know I just just talked about Calvinism and today's question and answer it's recognition of of of your state as one of the elect let's say and Jonathan young Jonathan had had an awakening early on but it didn't take and the Puritans were well aware of this and understood that a lot of this is what happens so an awakening was no guarantee of salvation Jonathan described his ephemeral boyhood experience as one of the two most remarkable seasons of awakening Timothy Edwards Jonathan's father like the vast majority of England of New England's preachers was convinced that we must not flinch without from warning sinners of the dangers of falling into unending hellish tortures Timothy recorded how a parishioner named Abigail Rockwell had been first awakened from hearing such a question expressed in a sermon to unconverted sinners namely can you bear to live half an hour in fire and if not how do you bear to live hell in hell for all of eternity eternal conscious torment Joshua Wallace jr. a local farmer reported how he was stirred to take more pains for an interest in Christ by fears of falling into the hands of an angry God to benefit from the first awful warning sinners had to reach a second step of true conversion which was humiliation and it's funny how you can sort of track this with a lot of the woke stuff to first you wake up to the fact that you're a racist or you're a bigot or you're part of the problem and now you need some as John McWhorter says some minister or priest to come and lecture you daily on the extent of your sin and to humiliate you into greater depths of righteousness but of course in in contemporary woke religion this is all gets into this whole video I didn't make and I didn't I didn't make this video because I don't really like talking about this stuff because it's just a pain I talked about that on my on my on my question and answer this morning this is Friday so if you want to look at the Friday April 9 especially towards the end of the Q&A I pretty much told people exactly what I think of the whole woke anti woke wars and why the whole thing just sort of sickens me because I really don't think it's going to produce much of anything good for the people at reports to help but anyway sometimes this stage was described as invoking a sense of terror Puritan authors offered many complex lists of steps and Timothy's standard was relatively flexible and simple in emphasizing three essential steps but he does seem to have insisted on these particularly this one potential converts not only had to recognize their guilt deserving eternal flames but be truly humbled by a total sense of unworthiness and again well please tell me again how I'm an irredeemable bigot and I mean it's so amazing how this maps on to Puritanism that's part of a reason when I saw this developing in the culture it's like I know what this is I've seen this pattern before only then was one sufficiently prepared to reach the third step if God graciously granted it now again notice that this is God's work not not the supplicants work or even the ministers work of receiving God's regenerating light or a new spirit created in them so that they so that they truly repented and sin would no longer reign in them but rather they would be guided by the Holy Spirit dwelling in them and they would receive the gift of faith in Christ alone for their hope of salvation and would gain and experience and would experience a glorious change to a life dedicated to serving God and that experience was foundational and fundamental in this whole process and I'm not reading this to to to disagree with it I think that's a terrific mapping on the process of and in many ways it's built into if you follow any of my sermons misery deliverance gratitude where misery we learn just how blinded and hoodwinked we are just how much of a meaning crisis we're living in the midst of deliverance that someone has intervened on my behalf and that's huge humiliation you know it's it's sometimes not even the leap of faith it's stumbling into it or being thrown into it by by forces far beyond ourselves and then the third step of being graciously granted and then how then can we respond to the grace given to us so back to the podcast and my commentary on it so who is the square jawed Chad well the square jawed Chad is in a sense the authentic man or woman a Chad woman I don't know but the authentic man or woman are my sound settings too low yes they are now some of you might have to adjust your volume but they won't change again so the square jawed Chad he's in a sense the one freed from the shackles of but in our modern contemporary imaginary it's propaganda or ideology where you can be your authentic self one might even have to turn myself down a little bit so that's the square jawed Chad you know conflict may come and you have essentially banked up and so that's let's call that one piece right financial independence and it ran it requires not to state the obvious but it requires or may not even require courage the less fear you have right if courage is acting in the face of fear if you have minimized the risk or the damage of being canceled or any type of media retribution you have less fear to overcome it just makes it easier like you said to have that ideological freedom hold the position that's right the second thing is if you read books like beautiful trouble do that is I do not okay so that's like I feel like I'll be saying I don't and I do not a lot in this conversation please continue no no it's a beautiful trouble is an awesome window into another world which is it's sort of like you know how it's a handbook for activists and so you sort of learn when you read it you'll be like whoa I recognize that from this event and I recognize that from this event and you start to realize actually how much stuff you read in the paper some part of it is sort of from corporate PR but another big chunk of it is from activist PR now notice what we're doing here so you want to be the square-jawed Chad you want to be past generations would say the self-made man you want to be this one who is a rock an island owned by no one the authentic self well that's not quite so easy because everything around you is constantly colonizing you and and especially in a democratic moment I mean the the path to power is gaining the consciousness of the mob and riding the mob into the White House or into wealth or to become language just reveals itself you know to become an influencer that's the goal but but you don't want to be the influence see you want to be well the mooks and Knights dynamic of course always goes both ways but you want to be the square-jawed Chad you want to be the independent thinker you want to be the one person who rises above the rest and knows all the answers and of course Balaji Srinivasan is in some ways the square-jawed Chad because I'm sure he's fabulously wealthy and he's brilliant and he's on this podcast and he's founding corporations and he doesn't need angel investors he may be the angel investor and so now here the the one who has arrived quite early in life is going to tell us how we can arrive and give us the secrets of his success but well you know so here we go for example taking a laser pointer ish thing and shining a logo onto the side of a building there's various kinds of stunts like this but the one that's relevant here is there's this concept called spectrum of allies where you've got people who are at let's say there's five categories strongly supportive weakly supportive neutral mildly opposed and strongly opposed now when you start talking about this is like wow yeah i have been so now suddenly i'm having a little mini meaning crisis in me i have been duped spectrum of allies and you know then he goes through these you know boy this sounds like how many surveys i've taken and hmm and this is actually quite interesting and your goal as an activist is to recognize you can't just move people from plus two to minus two right away what you do is you try to find some incident or thing that is bad and then you go and you put a microphone to everybody and you force them to comment on this person or the sensitive like can you excuse this horrible thing and you try to force them from a you know a plus one to a zero or a half right and again once he says it you see this all the time and this is sort of the fuel of the outrage culture and of course one thing that i've commented on quite a bit behind it is this consensus about morality which again dominion is the product of you know generations of christianity protestant reference i mean so this outrage can you believe can you believe this is wrong and again and and this is so smart you're moving people just a little hair you're not going to have them you know listen to you and up now i'm whatever flag you have around your tribe you just you just want to sort of move it along it's you know a friend of mine and talking about how he how he led his church it was always sort of the rocking chair leading what do i mean by that have you ever sat in a rocking chair and you start rocking someplace and when you look at the rocking chair you think rocking chair doesn't go anywhere it just goes back and forth but when you actually watch the rocking chair you notice no you're actually kind of walking rocking across the room because there's just these tiny little incremental movements with every back and forth on the rocking chair and then and then there you go now that is actually a very premeditated thing one way of visualizing it is it's an attack on your social network okay this is a premeditated thing it's now it's an attack on your social network okay why would my social network be attacked well because hate to say it you're a product of your social network what i'm not an autonomous free-thinking individual who who just is spewing my authentic selfness to a monochrome world no you're formed you're made you're a product of your social network yeah sure you have some influence in it but uh they have a lot of influence over you too because again back to Peter Soni and ideas um you know you're always sort of readjusting your more your internal equilibrium in terms of whether you're gaining status or losing status and generally speaking within a social network you're going to be if you're telling the if you're telling the people in your social network what they want to hear you're gaining in status and so this is this is this process that in some ways it's quite likely that social media has reinforced and influenced and that's part of the reason we're getting this polarization it's not like a organic thing and it's a spectrum of allies and uh one way of thinking about this is you have a social network supply chain okay so visualize yourself you're a node at the center and you have a social network supply chain now he talks really fast and these ideas are fairly new so it's like whoa slow down slow down i have a social network supply chain okay you're being formed by them you're being shaped by them and so if you your meaning self your meaning crisis self is constructed by the formation around you just like there's a supply chain to build smartphones or computers or all of this stuff of course apple is great at supply chain if there's this supply chain to do this back during the beginnings of of covid we had questions about the supply chain for ppe where does our ibuprofen come from where do our respirators come from where do our masks come from oh my goodness they're all coming from china oh my goodness now there's a chip shortage everybody's making bitcoin and so nobody can buy a graphics a decent graphics card because they want to play computer games on a self-built computer and of all this complies but you have a supply chain into your social network and all of those nodes are also semi-self-conscious and also have their own supply chains and a lot of those supply chains run together but a lot of them are distinct so well there's the idea you have your employer let's say your ceo you have your investors you have your employees you have your customers right there's all these nodes around you i'm talking about from like a tech startup context but you can of course generalize this to something else and those nodes can be colored you know let's say they're gray or blue or red they can be colored according to their ideology and the most important thing about your social network supply chain and this is not obvious it is what periodicals they read and respect and not just periodicals but whatever their sources of information are okay well now we're getting into the whole rebel wisdom sense-making conversation because what is what is constructing their world around them because the information that they are getting is what's constructing their world and you know we've my goodness in the united states over the last number of years we've had a huge lesson in this okay do you watch fox news or do you watch msnbc well there's one um what what periodic what tv stations do you watch what podcasts do you listen to do you listen to social do you listen to jordan peterson do you listen to uh tana hossie coats uh you know on and on and on and on and on your world is constructed by the information that you're getting and you're trying to do sense making by virtue of that information and so well this is your supply chain these are the elements that are forming your world because those periodicals have root access to their brains if a periodical now root access of course he's talking in computer terminology well what's root access well way back in the day when android phones were new and iphones were new people wanted to run certain apps that would get around the limitations of the operating systems that were trying to protect you from yourself and so what you would do was you would jailbreak that's one of the things or you would root your phone and gain root access you have this in pcs too basically root access is the most basic level of access to the hardware you know you're very very low in the stack and so what he's saying is that the periodicals that people read the information the news sources that people gather from they themselves are going to be a function of the information that they are gathering and so therefore the influencers in their life is this whole social supply chain that is forming them in other words the non-player character is a function of the programming being done by all of their sources of information and again we certainly see this of others well you just believe this because you go to church or because you watch fox news or because you listen to jordan peterson or because you listen to paul vanderkley or because of this you believe all those things you're really a non-player character and i can see you and then the meaning crisis happens when we look in the mirror and we say oh my goodness i'm a non-player character who's just a product of all of my social media choices too and so in some ways he's asking you well take a look at what you're feeding from suddenly says you know let's say the wall street journal and you've got a bunch of republicans surrounding you for example right the wall street journal suddenly says you are bad all of those people who read and respect the wall street journal will suddenly like zombie-like turn their eyes glowing red and start excommunicating you or they'll move in the spectrum of allies so the guy who is on on the fence may quit the person who's really strong and strong supporter might move to what the minimum contractual obligation is so all i have to do is say something bad about trump and a whole people bunch of people are like unsubscribe they don't really unsubscribe it's like i'm not gonna listen to vanderkley anymore i'm gonna listen to mr reagan or i'm gonna listen to tim pool or i'm gonna listen to someone else and so we're always sort of going back and forth in this way and and again he's right that it's not just oh vanderkley said something unsolicited about donald unsolicitous about donald trump unsubscribe every now and then you get that in the comment section which is kind of funny you said such and such i'm unsubscribing okay it's just this it is kind of fun to have a youtube channel um and and really the your your fans are far more powerful than your critics because you know criticize me yeah you know it doesn't feel good ah but it's the positive feels you know the old psychological experiment where the class decides they want to they want to put the teacher in the corner so every time the teacher makes a step towards a corner they all smile the teacher doesn't know what's going on but they're programming the teacher and so before you know it the teacher's in the corner because every time the teacher took a step towards the corner they smiled and something inside the teacher's brain was like ooh positive dopamine so and pretty soon he or she winds up in the corner that's the difficulty of this whole you know if you want to have influence over someone praise them and if you learn that about human beings and you decide you're going to learn that about yourself oh be careful with the people who praise you be careful with the people who do good things for you because you're losing your sacred autonomy and so the attack it's like a mortar that lands in somebody's social network neighborhood that's what that's what negative press is negative press is an attack on your social network now how do you mitigate this well first as i mentioned you are you're you're like a quote sovereign individual you're financially independent so okay so what's our telos here what are we looking for we want to be a sovereign individual people pull away it doesn't matter but second and more important you need to actually identify where likely attacks are going to come from and make sure you actually choose your friends your employees everything such that that's actually robust to foreseeable kinds of attacks and and i think people do this implicitly they do it in their language they you sort of get used to doing this kind of thing if you're used to speaking in public right you robustify your social network supply chain in the same way that a judicious person who runs a manufacturing plant is thinking okay china has some supply chain risk you are thinking okay that person has social network supply chain risk i think they would go south in this event and then you might want to get them off the board or you might want to not hire them as an employee or have a contractor and that's actually better for them as well because they may or may not know it but they're basically like the manchurian can't they've got like a remote chip in their brain and they're just like this when when you're denounced okay and now we have it actually relatively good in you know the west in you know the the term canceled by the way it's actually very juvenile it kind of comes from like tv shows being canceled like cancel cultures like teenagers complaining about and this sort of elliptical way of complaining about has made its way up to 30 and 40 and 50 somethings discussing this topic but the original term for being canceled was being purged that's what they called it in the soviet union and the people's republic of china and so on right and it could well be said that in the soviet union or the prc an editorial was a prelude to an extraditional execution you wouldn't just you know get canceled and lose your friends you'd lose life liberty and or property you'd be shot or jailed or certainly expropriated or all of the above sent to a labor camp in the cultural revolution correct and the other nodes in your social network might be as well like if you were you know a member of a family that had a known capitalist rotor in china not really very good it was possible just like people come back from being canceled ding xiaoping was actually purged three times his son was thrown through a window and you know like during the cultural revolution and was in a wheelchair for the rest of his life so i mean this is the kind of stuff that happened in other countries it got even more violent than it has so far in the u.s but we'll see what happens you know with that anyway point is that you know so that's a second mode of defense versus personal financial independence and second is collective independence you want to really think through who the nodes are that are associated with you and again when i listen to this description i see because religious communities have been doing this all along because in many ways religious communities have worked these matrices for very long times and and that's part of the reason propositional truths and confessions and all of this stuff sort of work the way it does and a little bit later is going to get into the piece of westphalia where a lot of this comes through because this is i mean this is really true and what happens at a certain point especially if you've been working in religious environments like someone like myself like a pastor does you begin to recognize oh i do this stuff all the time you're always sort of figuring out how to talk by virtue of this and shot this entire system out there because you know the one thing especially if you work for a religious institution canceling you know you see all this cancel stuff going out in culture and people people are like horrified that you can lose your job over an opinion it's like i could lose my job over all sorts of opinions all sorts of opinions you figure that filter out but part of the separation of church and state is that well at least you don't go to jail or you don't get burned at the stake i mentioned to i forget who i mentioned to it might have been rave kelly where i said you know the catholic church didn't really kill anyone the catholic the catholic church had the king or or the emperor or the local magistrate kill people that's the way it worked and in some places when you know for example martin luther didn't get got because his magistrate's like that i'm not killing my monk you know go jump in a lake if you want to i don't care i'm not killing him and then catholic churches has to how can we how can we get the government to do what we want it to do but it's this is a very old game by the way one interesting consequence of this if you flip it around is if you have a monochromatic supply chain there's basically nobody for example at the new york times company who reads and respects bright bart so bright bart has zero effect on the new york times company no no there can be manchurian candidate by them but the new york times company absolutely on if you go to bright bart's like extended social network supply chain there's absolutely folks you know whether it's ads or other kinds of things that read and respect nyt so a can publish article has no effect on b but b can publish it and has an effect on a another example is if and that's asymmetry which is a very potent thing if you're in ideological warfare against someone else xinhua xinhua daily and by the way i'm not saying anything pro or con about bright bart and my team just making an observation of fact there another example is xinhua net you know in china the chinese you know people's daily if you're chinese and they denounce you your whole social network supply chain is like whoa the government just denounces this guy you're in trouble if you're in the u.s nobody even reads chinese or even cares hey these guys are totalitarians who cares you know or at least that's that's what folks you'd be able to brush it off and so so it's more than just quote red or blue or whatever it's it is there's other colors to it right whatever you assign the color to the ccp or what have and so you know another one might be if aljazeera denounces you or russian state media denounces you you've got vulnerabilities to different kinds of things if you were a russian expatriate you might be much more concerned if you know rt suddenly started going after you then if you were just some random you know american or or even a chinese person go ahead let me pause there well i was thinking we could i'd be curious to hear what else you have thought about for yourself in terms of of self defense if there are any tactical recommendations and just also to come back to one of the examples you gave with reducing your expenses by 5x would you not so it's a combination of questions we can you can take them in either order but if you were employed by a tech company whether that's a google a facebook or otherwise is that not a significant vulnerability in the system while financially if you maintain your job you can withstand say public denouncement or media denouncement but the company may not have the same willingness absolutely absolutely so let me get to point number three so point number three is i gave a whole series of talks on this and i've been thinking about the technology for it as well something i call the pseudonymous economy so the thing is that real names weren't built for the internet real names are actually a technology in fact real names are stolen base in many ways even the term real names is stolen base it's better called a state name or a social security name and this is just fascinating and what's fascinating about this is my experience both in living in a place like get ready to check it off on bingo the dominican republic where people had multiple names they have the multiple name that's on your government id card you have the name that people in the village call you and often part of the reason it's different on the government id card and the people in the village is because the government id card might have got that from a friend through a friend and some dominican might have said oh yeah i gave birth to him 25 years ago so he's my son so he's really dominican and a lot of stuff going on but it's also very interesting in the book of revelation for example you know people have this name that is given to them by god and it's not the name that they have running around in the world and it's it's very interesting because these names are in fact you're you're sort of named by your patron or you're sort that doesn't translate for a lot of you you're named by the arena that you're in it's these whole the whole agent arena relationship here your identity is a function of the arena that you're in if the arena is family my identity is father if the arena is state my identity is citizen if the arena is church my identity in the christian form church is minister of the word your identity your name is a function of the arena that is manifest at the moment because the global identifier it's an identifier that anybody can type into a database and pull up all kinds of information on you and this is something where historically past cultures understood that giving out someone's real name was actually very bad you know or knowing it you had power over that person the reason is that if you read read this book seem like because the real name exposes and illuminates the base reality or the governing reality or the governing arena that is holding sway on the relational dynamics of the moment now that sounds terribly esoteric but hopefully the illustration works for you like a state seeing like a state yeah seeing like a state so this is a great book by Yale University Press that essentially talks about how names were developed to among other things simplify the process of conscription so rather than oh that guy over there with brown hair which is an analog identifier that could refer to a bunch of folks and those imprecise instead you'd say John Davison and that first name last name was a it's not perfect it's not quite as good as and of course in a dreaded patriarchal society David's son is David's son and if I look back in my genealogy into my Jewish ancestry I noticed when I looked back into that it's like oh my goodness it's just they just keep flopping these names and when they came to America and the courthouse burned down in the town that they were living in they got rid of the Jewish you know patronomic system and sort of yankified you know sort of Englishized anglicized a couple of the names and that became the name of my grandfather and his brother number but it's a reasonably good digital identifier where you could go down a list and cross it off and the thing is that would not just be conscription that you couldn't have even executed like Leninist redistribution of property very easily without those lists it was all about the list literacy is what actually enabled a big big chunk of them you had lists of names that's guys rich that guy's not rich take his property etc so the the point being that the alternative to real names or like a single global identifier and everything is pseudonyms search resistant identities which people are already using at large scale there's 400 million pseudonyms you know or pseudonymous users on reddit and by the way there's a distinction between anonymous pseudonymous and real name anonymous is totally disposable identifier that's like the culture of 4chan that actually is kind of a pit pseudonymous like reddit is a persistent pseudonym that accumulates reputation but that is at a distance from your global identifier in general what i think is the you know the piece of westphalia at the end of our 30 years internet war is going to be hold on pause for definition if i could click on know your history you say westphalia yeah so from 1618 to 1648 protestants and catholics slugged it out over religion but also over power you know who's going to rule the catholic church you know or or you know martin luther's guys it's not a great rendition of the piece of westphalia because one of the things that you notice is that when people look at the protestant refination oh that was a religious struggle not merely religious it was deeply political and the solution eventually was a political solution and when we talk about the relationship between nationalism and imperialism and religion again another question i got in the question and answer today things start to make sense about the way the modern world is constructed those protestants very bloody war lots of killing and it was basically centralization versus decentralization you know among other things and eventually the truce that came about was the so called piece of westphalia which established the modern nation state i was just thinking how how happy it makes me that you thought i might even know that i'm so uh honored so thank you but no please please continue i don't i don't want to i don't want to take us off track but uh i just that just that it made my day that just made my day i don't mean to drop an obscure reference and there's lots of lots of areas of history that i don't know about but this is one that i think about a lot because it's highly relevant i think to the present day in many many different ways arguably the 30 years war arose out of the introduction of the printing press because you could go and maybe a graph trigger that white cat meme there you go mean boys you're all over it you know all of martin luther's stuff and spread to people and that's how you know you did the software install boom into people's brains and that's the process of reformation distribution you know took off platforms platforms what was happening it's the decoupling of well state has to rearrange itself church has to rearrange itself now suddenly with the printing press your the the the social media formation of the people are coming through printed words well who's printing things well people who own printing presses and what the people who have printing presses don't aren't necessarily producing content now of course now in the internet age guess what vander clay is producing content as has has a printing press an amazing printing press in terms of a youtube channel that's what i'm doing so this technology gave rise to this huge fight that essentially redrew the map and the concept of the nation state was born out of that which is okay you don't have these transnational entities that the roman catholic church just can have influence everywhere instead we're going to have these sort of geographies and now he's he's greatly simplifying the relationship between church and state in the late medieval period or really any period since constantin perfectly defined areas that have the sovereign government with a monopoly of violence and a religion can't just walk in there and just start bossing people around there's like a lawful thousand truth and and so what's going to happen is you're going to decouple religion from state because well now you know states are you know states have a stake in the religious game which they do but it very quickly you know not very quickly but it inevitable it inevitably becomes evident that there needs to be a decoupling and of course one of the first great experiments of that is the united states but we're now continuing to process well can you actually have a nation state if there's not a degree of commonality among certain basic presuppositions and assumptions about historical narratives that's the question that we're sort of in the middle of right now the people came to you see in your lane i see in mine just out of all the bloodshed and to stop the bloodshed so i think we've just began hopefully there's not bloodshed or not much of it i think we've just begun i don't know if people think we're ending it but i think we've just begun the global internet like cold war where all of these social networks currency networks compete for ideological and economic dominance around the world because they can just spread virally back and forth like this and everyone will be trying to cancel each other and whatnot it's going to be this crazy crazy thing you know for example one thing i anticipate will happen sometime in the 2020s is i think in some country probably the u.s. for lots of reasons i think the cloud will burst and what i mean by that is something you know like treasury was just recently hacked with the solar wind thing people don't know what they got they could have gotten every tax return they could have gotten all kinds of very sensitive stuff and it was hacked with with what i'm sorry oh solar solar winds is sort of the name of the hack and you got it and the scope of it is not fully understood it's like this total onage of all kinds of government systems and this is not the first time this has happened it's also happened at the government of texas and so and so forth i'm not pointing at any particular entity the main thing is when there's a recent hack of ledger the crypto company their database was just blasted on the internet and you could actually you know i wasn't a customer but people could see their name and their home address on the internet and they're like a crypto fanatic who has a hardware wallet on there what a nightmare what a nightmare oh my god and and so it is like this and i know those of you who don't know anything about crypto are like huh what so so what if they have their home address thing where you know you don't um you can't easily change your home i mean some people can yeah suddenly you have guys in tracksuits showing up at your house potentially exactly it's like a potentially exactly it's like a rank-ordered list of who holds crypto really really really sucks may lead to home invasions other kinds of things very bad piece of information to have out there it's an enriched list so it's hard for now the focus here is on well currency well okay currency is a big deal and politics well politics a big deal but in terms of the stack notice how the entire cancel culture works on the assumption of the moral layer of a of a of narratives of moral agreement that's where it is on the stack and so well religion is dead ah no religion is the most basic level and you know begins in the protestant reformation and nation states sort of step in because you know before there was always this uneasy relationship between the magisterium the magistrate and the religious organization so you want to say magisterium right there you begin to see some of the blend between the the religious organization and the government and you know you know at nate heil on the question and answer day talk about his christian anarchism which i i think he rightly connected it with a lot of anabaptist theory because anabaptist theory tends to to the anabaptist part of the protestant refination was the radical reformation and i made the comment in the question and answer today that actually in a lot of ways a lot of anabaptist ideas won even though anabaptist organizations didn't really win and i think part of that has to do with sort of the nature of anabaptist theory applied to organizations it's it's a difficult it's a difficult thing to work so maybe um yeah maybe some of you anabaptists will have problems with that but that's okay you know where to find me so there was more on this i wanted to get to hang on okay i'm jumping ahead and he's talking about the uh 2008 um housing meltdown and uh the banks and again some of you are going to have a lot of opinions about this i don't but what where he goes with this is really quite interesting technology came in through the windows in the chimney or what happened and it's actually sort of reforming the system against their will like dodd frank did not reform the banks it just sort of enshrined them it was it was uh you know a coronation in the name of a regulation right yeah it did reduce some of their profit levels in some ways but it made them like more invulnerable go ahead you're gonna say no i'm just i'm smiling i'm enjoying so and for those who who can't see us because we're probably not publishing video we're we are currently on video so we can watch each other's facial expressions please continue sure sure sure yeah i like i like i like the uh the coronation disguised as regulation right right exactly right you know so so it is it is literally picking winners because you're writing the regulation that assumes a certain structure and capital requirements i mean like the concept of smart contract was not contemplated in dodd frank you know like like a contract that could be executed independently of a judge or or a person okay what's my point point is as faith in the pre i mean i don't think many institutions that predated the internet will survive the internet that's a big statement but i think about that with respect to the roman catholic church because the roman catholic church survived the protestant reformation the protestant reformation hit in certain places in europe very unevenly it hit the holy roman empire it hit the netherlands it hit switzerland it hit england it hit hungary it hit some of these places and from those places it spread out throughout the rest of the world obviously in north america in the united states became you know a deeply pot protestant nation you know roman catholicism really started to impact at the middle of the 19th century but what the protestant reformation did was force the roman catholic church to to basically address it in a number of ways and there's a lot of elements to the counter reformation it's interesting how you know robust religious traditions are and it's you know his comment there i think is is profound yet at the same time one of the comments i made with respect to platforms the kind of disruption that the internet does and technology in general does doesn't seem to always displace older things but rather relocates them for example horses are still around horses are a fine hobby like i said i have a cousin whose wife is now a farrier she does horseshoes for that's her that's her job she was working in an office she likes this a lot better it's a physically demanding job but she enjoys it and this is part of the reason why i made the quip on twitter about beth moore you know beth moore inspiring women to keep horses beth moore as like imagine her sort of the founder of uber inspires women to keep horses in other words women to lead churches and in some ways our churches like horse stables as compared to beth moore who you know first via bible studies you know colonizes and infiltrates churches infiltrates and penetrates social networks you know before there were social networks churches in many ways one of the ways if you want to influence churches is through well this is basically how john calvin did it calvin's institutes became enormously popular an enormously popular book and via the printing press and john calvin's institutes he influenced generations of protestants in europe and of course he had geneva and some of his ideas take root through john nox in scotland and through the puritans over to america and you know those are powerful things as opposed to what was you know happening officially in places and and it's in that way that the leadership of of institutions lose control because these ideas just go out through these other platforms and take over it is this universal asset and the reason is because it connects people peer to peer and so what that does is it i mean one of my laws of internet physics is the internet increases variance okay why think about that laws of internet physics because a lot of times this guy talks so fast and he's throwing so many ideas out there and these ideas he's been living with and they're familiar to him but you have to kind of slow him down and say the internet increases variance what do you mean by variance diversity so so part of what happens in confessional churches is that and again this is a this is a product of the protestant reformation confessionalism was a way to manage diversity and nation states were going to have a unified confession that was going to define them as nation states that continued to break down and another step in the breaking down of that was religious toleration where now the federal government of the united states well early on different states had their own state churches but states gave them up there would be religious toleration but then you begin to ask well what's you have these religious confessions what are the commonalities between them that are actually in some ways being the non-confessional implicit religions that are affording the cooperation of the state to function and so actually a lot of what i do on my youtube channel is i'm always trying to discern and you know we've been talking about this for a generation in church planting land trying to exegete the culture because there are religious there are religious confessions beneath the surface and jamie smith has has written about this and and a lot of his work with his cultural liturgies that there are cultural liturgies there are religious liturgies beneath the surface that are propagating themselves and now what the internet does was is increase variance and and this is why so on let's say a place like an estuary like the bridges of meaning discord server there's enormous variance in the bridges of meaning discord server how can we have productive conversations despite the enormous confessional variance in some ways that's been a part of my life's work it's been a part of what's at the heart of this channel i mentioned in the question and answer today i recently did an interview with a young man who's in an evangelical seminary and someone made the comment we need more evangelicals you should talk to more evangelicals and part of me thought i kind of talked to who comes forward i'm not really picking but another part of me thought i like talking to a lot of different people because i think one of the key skills we're going to need to develop is this capacity to talk across confessional lines not only confessional lines within christendom but but religious confessionality beneath the surface and and this i think is part and parcel about what Balaji Srinivasan is talking about in the internet age because variance has now increased enormously and so actually what we're doing as we're again back to Jordan Peterson's first lecture in the biblical series what we're doing is watching each other to develop you know the enter the idw protocol to figure out how can we do these conversations well and i do think that that David Fuller is is very right that in some ways a lot of the particular members of the idw failed in the idw protocol because sort of the inevitable happened especially if your if your goal is to be an influencer you want to pump up those numbers and one of the ways that you pump up your numbers in terms of your influencer followership is some of this mooks and nights dynamics where don't cross your audience but in some ways some of this idw protocol is going to be dependent upon a capacity to figure out how to get at deeper and deeper levels of productive agreement as we work on this stuff. First let me give the observation right the observation is you go from 30 minute sitcoms to 30 episode Netflix binges or 30 second YouTube clips. You go from a stable nine-to-five job to a 20-something billionaire or a 40-year-old failed son who's made nothing of themselves. You go from a taxi ride you know it's standard taxi ride to Uber which actually has very long trips and also very short ones like the whole thing is spread out relative to the ride time of a normal taxi and the reason for this like this is a very common thing in every area like in every I've seen hundreds probably thousands of companies at this point I've seen all these graphs right so you'll have to believe me that this is a synthesis of a lot of different graphs that I've seen when the internet disruptor comes in variance increases there's more downside and more upside more amazing outcomes and more really bad outcomes in all kinds of ways. I think this is exactly what we're seeing in terms of religious confessionalities. It's you know if the Protestant if the Protestant Reformation sort of became this massive fracturing of the church well in some ways it looks like the internet is a massive crushing of confessionality as a means of having church. That's a terrifying thing because that's a massive dislocation and and it's you know it's something I you know yeah this is a big deal. Does it happen because it connects people peer to peer entities peer to peer it removes the middleman it removes the media and in many cases the middleman in religious organizations in the United States is the pastor it's it's it's the middleman is the is this is this is profound stuff. It removes the moderator it removes the mediocrity now each of those words has a different connotation getting rid of the middleman everyone shares yay getting rid of the moderator people like oh I'm not so sure getting rid of mediocrity again everybody cheers so those are all kind of similar words but they mean somewhat different implications but they're all true at the same time. So what happens is you have these communities that then arise where nodes that can never connect to each other boom they form some bizarre subreddit or some amazing thing like ETH research you know which is put you know or Y combinator so it's like a and if you ever centrifuged anything have you ever centrifuged anything this is I can finally and and so then when I listen to this and I think about the application of this in my sphere I think well what I sort of see happening around me especially trying not to make this space about it make this a a reactive space make this a parasitic space you know again I think Jonathan Peugeot's parasitic storytelling is foundational because if I allow my channel to be parasitic in the sense that I am relying on well pick your pick your culture war nemesis I'm relying on my nemesis and on hatred against my nemesis in order to propel me up the hierarchy and we see this in politics all the time you know I'm going to vote for Biden to get Trump out of office I'm going to vote for Trump because he's going to really you know the the libs hate him you know all this all this parasitic all this parasitic group formation is really poison because because you can't build anything and and and so then in the age of the internet you have to figure out how can we build when the when what the internet and the internet internet disruptions bring is variance here's another interesting section quote QAnon or something but contrary and correct you know what I mean and that's actually like the whole teal thing you know you're actually making something that is in that in that quadrant and so those folks are not folks who are likely to just go down without a fight you know the whole thing these are these are activists and also highly highly anti-authoritarian generally speaking yes but but capable of organizing so not so it's an important combination right the way I describe the community actually I mean this is the best parts of the community there's all kinds of crazy actors in crypto I wouldn't endorse but you know maybe this is an idealization maybe this is the community I want to build but I think it is fair to say that the best tech folks and the best crypto folks are win and help win which is actually neither I agree with that yeah so here's the thing about that right see and win and help win and that's very different from parasitic that win and help win is neither progressive nor conservative nor libertarian and let me explain why okay so first conservative you know your typical conservative actually just you know and maybe it's a caricature maybe some of your listeners won't like this or there but like they just kind of want to stay at home you know they want to do their 95 they want to just have things not they're not as ambitious they don't want to leave their small town they don't want to go bright lights big city that's not dispositionally small c conservative at least your progressive often has a very zero sum mentality they may be ambitious but they often believe at a very fundamental level that the rich are rich because the poor are poor and and that's in a sense this this parasitic progressive that they they have an enormous difficulty in actually envisioning and constructing a preferred future because it's almost always against something and so and so in some ways they back into the future because they're always pushing against the past and they're feeling themselves to be progressive but they're backing into the future because they just keep they just keep pushing against it that one person's gain is another person's loss necessarily and they feel it's a zero sum conflict in the state you know is there a weapon and so on and the libertarian will say live and let live which is a vision of little house on the prairie all being by themselves etc and win and help win is none of those three it's ambitious in a way that the small c conservative is not it is positive sum in a way that the progressive is not and it is collective in a way the libertarianism and i think that's actually like the most powerful kind of philosophy where you are and notice also the ordering the sequencing win and help win that is to say absolutely take care of number one that's important because if you don't do that you can't help others win but do that as well two questions for you and i'm sure many more but it strikes me that what frances soares is doing what wyoming is doing is very valuable as an experiment and also possibly as different prototypes and that there are governors and mayors who would be very interested in learning more about this but they don't know how to approach it is there a list of what these okay i'm gonna jump ahead to another place i think the future will be more different from the present is commonly understood and that's actually so more different than ours like was a year 2000 that different from 1970 not really i mean certainly there were political changes and obviously you know china had reformed and this gets into dalphits decadence thing sorry fallen and so and so forth but the rhythms of daily life were actually quite similar people got up they went to work there's like a there's a relative constancy there yeah there were there were phones but they weren't smartphones there were still basically landlines you know headsets or handsets right cordless perhaps over the last 20 years there's been an enormous change in terms of rhythms of daily life one way of thinking about that is what was your daily life when you woke up in 1980 okay so you would you know there'd be an alarm clock beep beep beep you'd wake up you'd go downstairs maybe flip on the tv to look at the morning news make some eggs drink some orange juice maybe read the morning newspaper go and drive to work where your job involved if you're white collar like some papers and if you're blue collar you're going and hammering something or whatever you come back maybe go to the bar on the way back or you just come straight home and you know play with your kids or something like that and almost every aspect of that has now changed how do you wake up you wake up to your phone what's the first thing you do notice and implicitly in the old story you were married and had kids now you look at all of your email because you're getting just all these messages right messages are coming into you right you have this personal communication to us so first thing you do is different um this is for people who are addicted to their phone but a lot of people are you come downstairs or you get up and um maybe you've got some fitness thing that has read off your sleep so you look at that because your sleep was also instrumented you know you go to the kitchen and uh yeah there's food there but maybe you just go straight to work and you uber eats you know food to work or maybe you don't go to work at all and you just work remote from your pajamas and you know the living room which is totally feasible today your job isn't evolving papers or hammering things but it's hitting keys everything is with 50 people who you might have never met in person that they're remote all around the world through the day you're like reading newspapers you're reading code your job is just much more variable than the hammering job rather than pushing the same button for 20 years now there's a bit of a filter in here because a lot of people don't live like this okay he works in a world where a lot of people do and probably a lot of you living listening to this do live like this but i i just want to i just want to notice that filter you're pushing a different key every second basically every single second of life from your sleep to your sleep tracker to your food through your ordering apps or what have you to obviously your work to your finances to your communications to where you decide to go after you finish working like okay let's do google maps now the whole map has opened up one thing we take for granted in the 80s and 90s when you really had to get atlas to or you don't get get a map out to go somewhere new you have to study because you could get lost getting lost was a thing never get lost anymore not in the same way so for the most part thoroughfares were really important people didn't really go off to be in path that much unless you had a house over there it was like the fewest number of turns you really didn't drive around random you didn't go to like this random coffee shop over here the map was mostly like corridor you know it wasn't opened up and so that's all opened up now your your your recreational life you can meet with a different person rather than the same group of friends so in so many ways the rhythms of life we've turned into these sort of nomadic creatures from 20 years ago and our political structures and our and our homes and a lot of those are things haven't flexed to accommodate that and one way to think about that is there's two major ways that humans operate there's like the hunter-gatherer you know where roam around the world many religions many cultures have something similar to a garden of eden type thing which is whether it's in our genes from you know some primitive hominid ancestor that we've got all the way down because vision is baked into the genes of course like the reason you can recognize something is human there's that's genetic so maybe there's some something coded into us from many many millennia ago that recognizes garden of eden like thing we're hunter-gatherers who knows how it's represented and and then of course there's a farmer and the warrior right where you have a piece of land rather than roaming all around you're settled in one spot and your food is worse it's grains it like messes up your teeth and so on it has you grow less but it's more reliable it's more consistent rather than the variable ups and downs of the hunter-gatherer and in many ways what i think and this is not original you know to me by any means fusion synthesis a lot of different ideas but perhaps at least this take on it is you know we're going back to the hunter-gatherer way of doing things but with technology the best quality of life will actually be available to the digital nomad best arguable who has a minimum number of possessions has the ability to pick up and move stakes at any point has because mobility is leveraged against the state right a state as a sessile actor mobility is something that you can do as an individual the state cannot do not as easily you know it can't just stretch a tendril somewhere else so new kinds of polities will form new ways of self-governing humans that are fundamentally network-based rather than state-based fundamentally optimized for mobile social networks as opposed to stationary houses because the assumptions are fundamentally different and you know basically for example you know i define a network state as a social network with an integrated cryptocurrency and a sense of national consciousness that eventually crowd funds territory okay and i think that's a new kind of thing that's at least one definition of network state that territory doesn't have to be all in one place it can be a cul-de-sac here a ranch here an apartment building here and so you have you know a group of a hundred thousand people let's say that owns pieces of territory all around the world and that is constantly in communication with each other through a social network and considers themselves to be a people it's like nation national formation distillation that centrifugation that we talked about out of the internet boom it's a network state and and again what interests me is to what degree have i started unwittingly an ecclesiastical network state you know many have noted that well pastor paul i hear more hours of your content than i listen to my local church pastor and i don't want to completely just push aside the importance of locality and i mean right from the start our this whatever it is we have going here has valued in real lifeness but it's kind of going in a both and direction you know again this this part of the podcast just really got me thinking and it is a like a cloud formation taking physical shape you know the clouds are actually distilling down and so you know when i think about the future i think about this type of stuff where i'm just thinking from you know i'm thinking about 50 different graphs this is going down this is going up this is going down this is going up actually jordan peterson had a good remark on this is like the number of different revolutions that's happening at the same time is too hard to track tinder alone is a complete change in how mating happens swipe right swipe left swipe right swipe left that itself is like this huge thing that would dominate the textbooks of another age you know because this is a massive change in how like the daily rhythms of life operate you went from having like have you seen the correct one for jordan peterson of course again i talked about this in the question and it's a really interesting question because again i talked about this in the question and answer today part of the question is how the story verse and the matter verse interact and one of the key ways it does throughout human history is via mate selection because a lot of our hierarchies are story verse hierarchies and if you're if you're competing on a story verse hierarchy and then it gets into mate selection you know you have so my mother-in-law's name was jenet and i used to make you know that's that's genetic squared because it's jenet but the child of jenet is you know both has the genetic attributes of jenet plus the parenting attributes of it gets squared so so graph of how people meet their partners i have not okay this is an amazing graph of like how people meet their significant other 2020 update basically each little curve here tells a story but it's like did you meet at church did you meet through your parents you mean at college you mean at work and you can see like meet at work is like this boomlet that kind of drops off it's peaked in the 80s and it drops off in the 90s with you know various kinds of pathologization of something like that right so what dominates everything today is internet internet internet and in particular basically what norms have shifted now is that it's actually more legitimate i mean like i've aged out of this fortunately right but for my younger you know friends what have you it is impolite to hit on often considered depending on the situation it's often considered impolite to hit on somebody in real life but it's totally okay to do so on tinder so of course humans are contextual and of course the same behavior that's okay in a in a bar is not okay in a workplace or now but now that's actually extended to digital venues as well so tinder alone is just this mass of revolution and then you have like 20 of them happening at the same time and so all of those are these things where the institutions that we have are simply not built for this at all and that's what they're straining and stressing against and they're going to give and we have to have a vision so you're more a student of destabilization or stabilization but it just so happens that right now these multiple revolutions combine to present destabilizing forces not so much that you view humans or the future of humans through a dystopian or pessimistic lens is that fair to say yeah that's fair to say i think there's actually a lot of good stuff that's going to come out of this i think we are one of the questions will be is this is this acceleration we're seeing a temporary thing or is it part of a curve and so there's a lot of questions there but that that section again got me thinking about well what do i see happening around me because i'm using these tools i'm using a youtube channel i'm using a podcast i'm using a discord server i'm using twitter what does the church look like what is a church i don't know but stuff is happening and it's going somewhere so yeah so again thanks to my colleague who pointed this out listen to the whole thing um let me know what you think in the comments
