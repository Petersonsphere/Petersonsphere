 Hi, this is Paul. I was gonna do a little video on a little clip from the Peterson-Pageau thing Just a sort of a way to end the week and the more I thought about it the bigger it got This won't be too big. I want to try and do something short Part of what I'm always chasing is how to talk about The line Does the line these men are wavering over I'm thinking about Tom Holland and Jordan Peterson Does the line these men are wavering over make a difference and what's just so absolutely inspiring and delightful about both Tom Holland and Jordan Peterson is How honest they are about exactly who they are and what they think and what they believe? That's Very unusual in high-status high-profile public figures How to get at this line because in many ways many of you Wonder about this line so many of my conversations not only not only you know My conversations with Poe my conversations with with many of you who who are well sort of a mythological Christian I'm not really I can't really say I believe in Jesus resurrection from the dead. I can't really Believe that he rose physically and what that means just in today's question and answer I talked quite a bit actually about the physical resurrection and what that means in terms of It doesn't simply mean The body of Jesus it means that the spirit of Jesus is manifest in physicality and history as History pursues its climax until Christ is all in all that's what the resurrection means CS Lewis writes about that and in his book miracles Now often we talk about becoming a Christian, okay Well, what does that mean and especially in the light of the fact that Christianity has so made progress in colonizing our moral assumptions and Even even the critics of Christianity use Christianity to criticize often quite rightly and fairly the church Ascending to some propositional truths about history that seems so Insufficient so often to to to be on one side that says I'm skeptical about whether or not Jesus rose from the dead as Sam Harris bullied Jordan Peterson into saying almost certainly not Jordan wasn't feeling almost certainly not in his conversation with pageau But but it seems in some ways that that merely ascending to a historicity of a resurrection is insufficient and Peterson in his conversation with pageau Bears that out how many times that if if this is true and for Peterson It's a question of the the net the relationship between the narrative and the physical If this is true Nothing I do if I really believe this nothing I do would ever look the same than if I didn't believe it and this is where you get into Peterson's understanding of We don't we don't we act out our beliefs and and our beliefs are not transparent to us Just because I have said many times that our beliefs are not Volitional in that we don't choose our beliefs our beliefs choose us and so we're formed and framed and and deep within modernity Each of us very much myself included are deeply materialists deeply naturalists deeply skeptical about What not not just again as CS Lewis mentioned in miracles what would happen the first five minutes after Jesus You know gets clung to by Mary and seen by Peter and all of that but the idea that the resurrection of Jesus is the physicalizing of the spirit of Christ throughout history which is exactly what Tom Holland is writing about and and what Jordan Peterson is struggling on is the is the reality of the narrative touching down And colonizing reality and colonizing physicality Somebody just wrote me and said, you know, Peterson is stuck on as a change of metaphysics and And that's right. This is consciousness first and matter second is consciousness derived from matter but but just making a difference and making making a making a decision with respect to the priority of this and our attitude to this Decision with respect to the priority of this and our abstract thought is insufficient in fact the the profession of my faith in the Lordship of Christ is in many gay in many ways analogous to the profession of the physicality of the resurrection because What it means is that that resurrection is now moving my lips and changing my heart and forming my soul and If in fact that is the Spirit of God if in fact that Spirit of God That gets imparted to the Apostles on the day of Pentecost It's the Spirit of God moving and changing the world Every time you see the bricks and mortar of a church you can see the physicality of the resurrection on A street near you now now again Peterson so passionately and clearly and correctly Challenges the witness of the church and says if you if you really bore witness to that man that I read about You would be far more impressive than you are and that's right The church continues to struggle the content the church continues to stay in a twilight Part of the image that I kept having of Peterson in this in this conversation was this moment in I Think it's infinity wars when when Thor's death was the last time Thor is has to open, you know, of course these these these setups in these movie casts are if you've ever seen Galaxy quest You know, they have these chomping things and you have to go through Crazy hallways and almost puzzle rooms in order to do something on the ship So, you know here these handles and the full brunt of the sun of the star has to go through you be yada I mean, it's it's still so totally contrived But But if you try to draw pictures of the book of Revelation you have exactly the same problem, okay things don't necessarily Work out mythologically like they do mechanically All right. So so here in this moment Thor has to Open the shutter as it were and let the full force of the Sun come in so that they can melt the stuff So that his new hammer can be forged, you know all of that stuff And You see Peterson wrestling with him because in many ways he recognizes to to open this door in his heart To cross this line to go on YouTube and to YouTube and say I believe and not just have it be You know as mundane and pedestrian as as we see Christians every day and in the unimpressiveness of it Peterson understands the stakes And he rightly rightly sort of pauses Because he knows it's a point of no return a Philosophical decision isn't really it He notes that Christians have been unimpressive to him. The church is unimpressive to him He feels the potential of what a transformation could enable and he's exactly right and again, he's got plenty of experience of Intellectual plausibility plenty of experience. I was listening to one person that was saying and I hear this often Well, it's the it's this the it's the experience No it isn't the just merely the experience and I make this point when I I preach on the Gospels that Jesus disciples regularly have intensive mind-blowing Experiences of him when he stills the storm so the disciples are freaking out in a storm on the Sea of Galilee and And Jesus is asleep in the boat and they're probably as annoyed at that And so they they grab him and say don't you care if we die? Jesus looks at them like you guys just don't get it and he stands up and he stills the storm as if he was taking You know as if the disciples were afraid of some rottweiler and Jesus says go sit in the corner The storm stops and they look at him People have those experiences all the time Peter had that experience that bid me Lord come and walk on the water and he takes a step out of the boat And then he looks at the wave and sinks and Jesus Peter You can have experiences all day long, but they are not going to stick the Spirit of Christ Physically manifest in the world through the resurrection through history through The lame churches and preachers and wobbly Christians through all of this the experience alone Won't do it because the moment the experience is done the rest of the mundane manifest image Imposes itself on you and so the same Peter that that looks at Jesus after he stills the storm and saw Jesus Multiply the loaves and fishes and and and and walked on water momentarily because Jesus bid him to come that same Peter Loses his faith and denies his faith By a fire when a slave girl asks him and this the Judas who saw these things loses faith probably with Jesus because Jesus isn't living up to his political narrative and and Jesus should be wielding the crowd to storm Jerusalem and take out the Romans and Jesus is a loser Judas concludes better to cut His losses take the cash and go but then he regrets that too It's not about the plausibility of a mere experience. You can have mere experience. It is Someone asked recently or two weeks ago in the question and answer it is a leap of faith Sometimes you leap and sometimes you just fall because you have nothing else Of the idea that narrative governs the physical Lewis writes about this in miracles You know our our the narrative of my mind governs my hand now that gets really complicated because in a lot of ways the consciousness The consciousness and they've got lots of studies about this I I knew I was going to move my hand before my conscious Governor told my hand to move Were that complex? Mentally, okay. And so it's in that way that and Jordan knows this that he's not he's only Tangentially in charge of himself which which in some ways makes this this this Wivering on the line So tantalizing but probably so frustrating because Jordan the spirit of God's got to give you a push baby You know ask for it asking it shall be given seeking you will find just just just just And I think that is in many ways the moment of conversion when we go to God say I can't I can't jump this gap Push me and I think of I think of Lord of the Rings, you know Gimli says to Gimli says to to Aragorn at at At Helms deep it's too far. I can't jump it toss me and in many ways When we get to that when we get to the end of our resources, we have to look at God and say toss me But he does toss and It can be terrifying and and and perhaps what we're seeing is is the tossing right here and right now Played out in real time You know Lewis or or Peterson, you know talks about the synchronicities and I Don't know that Peterson needs another Psychedelic trip or he's he's intimated plenty of times and if you're well versed with the Peterson Corpus, you know the kinds of dreams and visions he has I've had I've had other people who watch my channel Who have other information come and tell me stories of it This this is some people have a lot of this and some people don't it's just the way it is They see it in churches all the time Peterson's one of the guys who has a lot of it and it's like, okay Jordan You know, are you are you are you gonna let go and let him toss you? What really do you have to lose? Tammy did a quite a remarkable conversation with her daughter and You know Tammy, I don't know in these people in real life. I've never you know, shaken Jordan's hand I don't need never introduced me to his wife. But you know when she tells her story she didn't have a choice she knew she was on her way out and It was life and death and she knew she had to yield if she was going to be around for her daughter and her son and her grandchildren and Prayer sometimes takes different forms for different people God meets us where we're at the first the first thing I ever communicated to a podcast it was a was an English podcast and God answers His Misaddressed mail He does and so you might not know how to pray you might not know the words to say But the book of Romans says he knows your heart And if you cry out to him he will answer now that doesn't mean he will give you the solution you may be Thinking you need or looking for In her interview with her daughter is full of yielding examples now some may question People are going to question everything. This is the Internet so let's be careful about judging and You know pray that She continues on her journey that she's going to and that and that The Spirit of God take her by the hand Christians trust Jesus more than they trust themselves and that's Now we keep fighting him you see that in church all the time. We keep taking it back. We keep fighting him But this is the path. This is the way The other thing on the other side of this is is the cruciform path because Peterson may imagine that if he if he leaps or Falls or asks God to push him that this will somehow yield That that the that the experience will be like a vision or a dream or a psychedelic trip or a crazy Dramatic Mystical thing sometimes it is for people I've I've talked I've spoken with a number of people who have experiences like that most of the time it's slow and quiet because You have to understand Jesus If most of us were to write a script for Jesus It would be probably not too dissimilar to what the ancients imagined they they imagined Paul Apollo descending on a golden chariot something of that nature and And this is exactly the point of the temptations of Christ with the devil that are in the Gospels The servant isn't above the master Jesus is the son of God and Does he win arguments? Jesus if you've been following my sermons Jesus that land around Jesus is careening in their culture war towards the explosion of 67 to 70 ad that will culminate in the destruction of the second temple Jesus weeps over Jerusalem and says I can't talk you out of this Your self-destructive and you're destroying yourself the son of God lost his culture war You have to ask well, what was the resurrection after Not just a body that Thomas could touch But a world in which bit by bit But a world in which bit by bit He is transforming by his spirit at a pace that sometimes is breathtaking But often is so slow and indiscernible that that that even great saints have questions and doubts The path of the master was not of power over but power under and power through suffering My grace is made perfect in weakness. He tells the Apostle Paul Apostle Paul comes and says there's this thorn. I'd like you to remove Then the Spirit of God says no That's the way of the master the servant is not above the master Miracles may happen but as I've said on my channel before I know people who do miracles and It's almost always a Cruciform path They pay for the miracles they do for others. It's a substitutionary pattern That the mother brings the child into life through her costly love The good parent lays down their life for the child day in and day out in small and subtle ways that do not look miraculous But yet manifest the pattern of the God Who was crucified for his people? I Talked at the in today's question and answer about the role of the church. I Gave an example of an image of a self-taught clinician Jonathan repeatedly Recommends that Jordan Start taking the church seriously. Yes that church think about the story of Elisha and Naaman the Syrian Naaman comes in and He's got leprosy and he's got a Jewish slave girl and the Jewish slave girl says, you know that place that you raid Probably where they stole her from? there's a prophet who could heal that leprosy and so Naaman goes down with With all of his treasures and you know, he understands how prophets work. You send him a big check and they do what you want And he gets down there and keep your money That Jordan over there Duncan at three times you'll be alright next Offended I've got much better rivers in my hometown than that that miserable excuse you call you call a river Then again the slave girl says, you know if he'd asked you to do something really big You would have done it. This is life and death Why don't you just humble yourself and listen It's what the church is the church is the muddy Jordan I'm gonna go to a church and you see us Lewis had the same thing. Are we gonna am I gonna sing? Terrible songs with bad music and listen to that Listen to that priest or minister up there who knows far less than I do Droll on and on and waste my time and sit here and look around at the other silly people at church Who are busy with their own silly games and there's all the infighting and all the mess that's the church Am I really gonna dunk in that river? If he asked you to do something hard wouldn't you do it the only thing dunking in the river The only way that that's hard is because it's humbling And that's the path That's the path. It's always been the path. It's the path of humiliation That's exactly the path that Jesus walks Jesus says y'all can't figure this out I'm gonna come down here and I'm gonna go first and you're gonna follow me But I'm gonna lay down all sorts of power and glory and that you didn't have to begin with and You're gonna follow me So imagine a self-taught therapist no university degree no licensing just a library card and maybe might have helped a lot of people but but They don't have what Someone else might have the good and the bad a world of communal imprints living without how do you know how to be a Christian? If if you don't get to watch even the bad examples There's no mutual accountability or support or covering or all those things and so Jonathan says, you know lean into that get it get into that muddy river and Yeah, that the music might be terrible. The preaching might be ghastly That the preacher might be a lying preacher But if he told you to do something hard wouldn't you do it What this hard is is Humbling because what you really need to do is lay down your pride It's always pride And it's a loss of autonomy the most terrifying thing for us to face especially now as as Contemporary powerful people who have elevated choice to the top of the hierarchy You know, I see it all the time as a pastor people get a bad word from a doctor and they say well You've got cancer you can do chemo or you can do radiation and someone say at least you have a choice. Oh fine choice No choice is not the greatest thing in the world by any means What we do is we lose our autonomy and that's of course exactly what pushed Tammy All the choices were bad We become servants and slaves to Christ and we're humbled again and again Jordan Peterson is right that many of his slaves are unimpressive Some are really bad at it But others just look bad Because they're judged in the light of this world and at some point after the revelation They will be revealed to have and they'll be the people probably not me the celebrity pastors The people who who everybody knows their name and you know, they're There It'll be I Can think of a number of them and they might look unimpressive to you But when someone needed a meal they came with a casserole and When someone ran out of money an anonymous envelope showed up in the mailbox And when that little church that really shouldn't be alive still stays alive Because these people are sacrificing and giving way beyond their means So much so that the IRS has to check up. Did you really give that much money away? Because that's way beyond our metrics And they didn't let anybody know The book of Hebrew says this world is not worthy of them and that's true and For their own sake the world does not see them and applaud because the applause of the world is a very dangerous thing and So Peterson's a tough cookie and he's right there on the edge I Have to tell you don't play chicken with God don't make him push you Because he does things we don't think are kind gentle or responsible sometimes It costs us everything But we find rest for our souls That's what I want for Jordan It's what I want for you
