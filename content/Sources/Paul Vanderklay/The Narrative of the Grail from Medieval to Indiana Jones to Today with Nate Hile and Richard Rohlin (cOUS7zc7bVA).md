 Hi, this is Paul and this is a Friday live stream that is going to talk about the grail and with me today I'm going to have Richard Roland and who's been on the channel before and also Nate Hile who runs grail country and Richard's Richard's logged in but he's not in front of his his camera and Nate isn't here yet So I'm just going to begin by telling you how I got here so again Probably for me most of my life. The Holy Grail was something that you bumped into source in a vague way I didn't read a lot of Arthurian Arthurian legends when I was young But you learn about King Arthur and Camelot and the Holy Grail and then there was Monty Python the quest for the Holy Grail and then there was The Lost Crusade Indiana Jones and the Lost Crusade or he had the Holy Grail that was a probably the extent to which the Holy Grail was ever in my imagination And then of course a number of years ago bump into Jordan Peterson Bump into Jonathan Peugeot get to know Jonathan Peugeot at first sort of really confused about what Jonathan Peugeot is doing and bit by bit getting A little bit more understanding and then Richard Rowland and Jonathan are starting to do this universal history and I'm trying to get my head wrapped around that universal history and Then Jonathan and Richard do a couple of episodes on the Holy Grail and I listen to them and it's just kind of like well that's odd, but okay, that's kind of cool and a few weeks ago the rest is history with Tom Holland and Dominic Sandbrook Did a couple of episodes sort of around the Indiana Jones things. This was timed around the Indiana Jones the latest Indiana Jones movie to come out and They did one on the Ark of the Covenant, which of course had my interest Richard I'm just giving an update about how we got there. I'll bring you into I'll bring you in in a minute or two and Something's beeping at me. Oh, that was me. Sorry. Oh, okay And And then I listened to Tom Holland's thing on the Holy Grail and I thought Because Tom Holland sort of approached it in a modernist historical fashion but also Tom Holland is sort of in this space because Even though Tom Holland is approaching things as a modern historian Tom has a longing to live into the story He's almost like Dorothy Sayers wanting to write herself into the story But Tom very much wants to inhabit the world that he's been studying and this has come obviously from his boyhood fascination with classical history and All of that and so Tom is just on the fence playing with these things and then I saw this show Mrs. Davis because Bishop Barron recommended it and oh AI is important AI is interesting and I watched you know sort of the show starts off similar to what sort of Bishop Barron portrayed and But the more I watched then suddenly the Holy Grail comes up I thought Are they just being silly or cute and then as the show develops? I thought the show isn't about AI This is a grail story and that led me to ask questions about Wait a minute What are we talking about when we're talking about the grail and why are we talking about it and in fact this leads me into What exactly is the grail and how does it function through history and through story and through this layer of Universal history I just started Taking a look again at Tolkien's fairy story Taking a look again at Tolkien's fairy stories and looking at Tom Holland thinking about The end of modernity and then the post modernity and what all of this means sort of keeping Chris Kavanaugh and his Complaints in the back of my mind and so I wanted to do a live stream today, and I wanted to talk about the grail so these are the guys that I invited in and so here we are and I thought what a It does in fact show up I was hoping for a big black eye It looks a lot worse in person the camera kind of like I don't know Makes it less Yeah, yeah, I don't even know when it happened how it happened really oh Well, I was doing jujitsu this morning, so it happened at some time in that but some time we had some very hard rounds this morning and Like I rolled with like like a six foot seven 350 pound linebacker from OSU And an MMA fighter and those weren't even the hardest rounds that I had this morning So like it was just people were just going you know yeah So it was people were going ham so I don't know when this happened It happened sometime this morning between the hours of 6 to 7 a.m.. But I So Richard mentioned that on Twitter, and I said if you show up with a big black shiner You're gonna break the internet in the symbolic world It feels like more of an abrasion than it does an actual bruise, but I think the bruising is gonna come. It's it's tenor I think the bruising will show tomorrow is I'm gonna ask the comment section is Richard sound a little low Because it sounds a little low to me about you Nate does Richard sound okay to you. I'm kidding. I'm okay Oh no momento hold on I Had the wrong I had the wrong Maybe I'm just getting old and hard of hearing so so Chad says okay So I So what what this is Davis did for me thanks to Bishop Barron? was by no means give me a vision of the Catholic ideal of Female orders being married to Jesus that is not what that show gave to me what the show gave to me was a Was a a question about what on earth is this grail and how is it functioning because Mrs. Davis was a grail story now Richard hasn't watched mrs. Davis Nate and I've talked about it a little bit you sort of have to say I did go out I did go out and like read some spoilers cuz cuz like Some people are like really against spoilers. I am a big fan of spoilers as a medievalist I think spoilers are like it's a trap from the elites to make you waste time by watching things You don't want to watch so I just went out looked up some spoilers, and I was like holy crap man That's that's like 50 like if it's even 50% that bad like I'm Is I'm not I'm not gonna watch this it's just not gonna happen But but to me that it was the grail thing that hooked me because even though the point of the show Was to destroy the grail which I thought was fascinating They they did you did you actually think they would though I? I was unsure until the end that was the cliffhanger I did not and when I discovered that that was the actual intent that they were actually gonna go through with the idea of Destroying the grail that's when I became appalled I actually can follow Bishop Baron up to the plate like as like I can follow Bishop Baron up to a point as seeing the Sexy Jesus as a metaphor because it is all happening. I mean it's all happening in Simone's Head right it's in her prayers and I can see it as a way of portraying the Nun as a bride of Christ But they but then they pushed that too far to the point where he should have got off board on that train But I mean up to a point like I can see like watching it early on and be like oh Like this is not theologically correct But this is an interesting way of portraying the nun as a bride of Christ even though it's done in this Very literalistic fashion, but it can still be read as a metaphor so I can follow him up to that point But like when did you not realize that this train was going completely off the rails like it's like Okay, so I have like a little bit of indulgence toward the bishop Like early on but there should have been a point where you realize this was like not just problematic, but diabolical Yes No, that's right. I mean can I can I just boil a little bit here? All you want prevent other people from wasting their time, okay, so as I understand it Having just read spoilers and not actually seen the show the grail is supposed to be the skull of Jesus Christ which is Which Mary saved after the crucifixion because she wanted something for him to Something of him to remember him by and so she saves the skull and then This causes him to be trapped in the state between like in limbo like the state between life and death So actually the Jesus we've all been worshipping along Is actually just caught in this place between life and death and they need to destroy the skull so that Jesus can move on and therefore we can as well right, that's the That that is I mean really close watching paying close attention Most people watching will probably be a little vague on all of the particulars and just I think again low resolution it'll be the grail is bad it needs to die Sister Simone's mission is to rid the world of the evil grail Yep, and then all those details fill it in right And it's crazy It is crazy I Mean in some ways it is a well, I mean in some ways it is a very well-made show It's it is interesting. It's captivating. I mean, it's certainly good at You know get it getting your attention But and it's very witty It has some some elements that are like good, but it uses them all for evil purposes Well, and and so that that then Brought into focus for me the way that the grail Seems to function in our imaginary as a revelatory thing because Your posture towards the grail which obviously mrs. Davis has a specific posture towards the grail which reveals the evil of the show and I know I'm a complete grail neophyte and that evil and that evil by the way and that evil Like is fully revealed through the words of Mary and The intentions of Mary which makes it all the more awful I didn't I didn't mean to wear my repping Mary t-shirt today. It was just a Grizzly show to that. Oh, by the way, I didn't mean to wear this t-shirt For his show, but I mean these are just like these are most of the t-shirts I own are things like this So, you know, it's is it better than zero chance of it happening, but it's providential. I mean, yeah, okay, I mean that Providence isn't a domain strictly of the Calvinists here. So that's we yeah No, I suppose we get like the Protestants just could just read it as a Revelation chapter 12 Shirt without determining who's depicted. But yes, if you resist the obvious conclusion, you're just silly Ambiguous woman clothed with the Sun and the moon under her feet. Don't don't worry about it. Don't worry Because we have no idea who that is it could be anyone Yeah, all right. Let's let's backtrack here and start with now Nate Has a I remember when Nate Nate's channel appeared named grail country and to me that was Hmm, that's interesting. I Every time I saw the channel come up before I actually watched one of his videos I was like this is gonna be like Arthur Ian like country music like like Johnny Cash ballad style, you know retelling of the grail story, which I would be 100% down for in fact Somebody make that happen So I want I want us first to for those who like me are complete neophytes in terms of this and maybe haven't watched Jonathan and Richards Take on the grail haven't listened to that Richard. Did you hear Tom Hollins? No, just this history on that. Okay, so um, I'm still I'm still feuding with Tom Holland over something really and it's really old There was a there was a mistake in one of his books and I may be the only person that noticed it and he's quite a quite a lovely person and I shouldn't hold it against him But like every time I think about I'm just like, oh But he was taken most books This one was like was was pretty a geek egregious to me as a as a Latin scholar as a medievalist But anyway, no, no, I just haven't I haven't watched it yet. I actually Haven't I mean since I stopped driving to work my podcast listening time is Greatly reduced. So yeah, but but I know I'll get to it. I just haven't got to it yet Okay so let's let's first have a little bit of Introduction to the grail and I don't I'm sure you two are gonna have some differences of opinion on some things I don't care who of you wants to go first. I don't think anything that Richard has said is wrong I just think he stopped short. It's incomplete Why I Don't know I don't know where I'm incomplete. So I've looked at you. Okay, Nate You let's you named your whole channel after the grail. So what's about the grill? So for me, I think full Gacob is the person who really nails the essence of the okay But that doesn't help anyone. No, no, I know it's not I'm actually I'm actually because I just I'm actually just have like this Is the one little short section I decided that I wanted to if I got the opportunity I had my bull Gacob book in this bag and I don't know where it went Okay, but I did find the water bottle. I was looking for so this is just a short little paragraph from this is from page 43 of the Holy Grail in the Eucharist and he says We arrive we thus arrive at the unexpected conclusion that Christ who ascended to heaven and departed the world Abides in the world in his blood and water. He's writing this as an exegesis of John 1934 and he points out that it falls to the earth and He abides not mystically as in the Eucharistic elements secretly invisibly to human eyes But essentially and really by virtue of his incarnation his entering into the world Christ abides on the earth without departing from us. However, he abides not in his personal mode Which is manifest and accessible to all but in his earthly humanity Christ remains with us on the earth in his blood and water and this abiding was taken away taken away from the earth Neither by the resurrection nor the ascension in glory The abiding is not a sacrament for sacraments despite all their mysteriousness are always known Since they are linked to a definite place in time Rather this abiding is a mystery the world's great holy divine mystery the world's treasure holiness and glory the Holy Grail This mystery is preserved and revealed in the life of the church and not only in the past life of the church in its present And and future but also that's present in future life It is not surprising if this mystery till now is still not illuminated by the theological dogmatic consciousness Has lived only in the obscure Percentiments of Christian legend and poetry in which the holy myth is clouded by human imaginings and romantic reveries but at the appropriate time this mystery can take center stage in the Christian world's consciousness and Then the holy treasure of Montserrat will catch fire with heavenly light and will lead the nations to meet the coming Christ The whole world is the Holy Grail For it has received into itself it contains Christ's precious blood and water The whole world is the chalice of Christ's blood and water the whole world partook of them in the communion at the hour of Christ's death and the whole world hides the blood and water within itself a drop of Christ's blood dropped upon Adam's head and redeemed Adam But also all the blood and water of Christ that flowed forth into the world sanctified the world This blood and water made the world a place of the presence of Christ's power Prepared the world for its future transfiguration For the meeting of Christ's common glory the world was not deprived the Christ's presence. I will not leave you comfortless Christ is not alien to the world the world lives by Christ's power The world has become Christ for it is the holy chalice the Holy Grail the world has become Indestructible and incorruptible for in Christ's blood and water it has received the power of incorruption Which will be manifested in the transfer in its transfiguration The world is already paradise for it has produced the tri-blessed tree on which Christ was crucified so Richard is absolutely right in that what's going on is Eucharistic, but the whole but the grail the reason the grail is The reason the grail is told the way it is through as poem as legend as myth is because it is it is Henning toward them toward the mystery of the cosmic Eucharist So it's not so it's not we can't merely confine what's going on in the grail stories to Just the sacramental Eucharist. That's where I would say like yes, but it's more than that. Okay at the same time What you did there Nate was beautiful But what you have failed to appreciate is the benefit of an introduction for people who have read less than 1,000 books and I have an IQ less than 135 We need to start in a much more simple place So it's really so okay, so I'll start where Bogotkov starts Bogotkov This this comes out of his exegesis of John 1934, right? So he's saying so he talks a lot about them about the symbolism of blood and water I won't get into that part, but the very simple part for what the passage I just read what you need to grasp here is that it's Christ's blood and water When it when it comes out of his side, it hits the earth. There's a very I actually noticed something a while back Now now maybe before we go there Do we want to actually explain like what even is the Holy Grail like yes, I think that's where No, no, yes, that's actually I have a perfect image that actually will reinforce what I was just talking about and suggest that so I don't know if you guys let's see it. Hold this up to the camera This is my personal rosary and I didn't notice this when I first got it But if you notice there, let's see if I can get it in the frame Yeah, right in the middle because right at the bottom of it at the bottom of it you'll notice there's a chalice Right, so there's actually which I didn't know I just I didn't notice it until I've been using it for a long time Because I'm not a super observant person, but there's actually an image of the grail right there on my rosary and So the grail is It's it's I most often represented as a chalice There is it's it's it's a complicated question when you ask what is the grail because Richard as Richard and I both know There are lots of different versions of the grail and the grail is depicted in different ways in different versions of the grail story but the most common Enduring images of is the chalice image like that's the one that's kind of captivated our consciousness So that's the most enduring image. So it's a cup and it's and and it's the cup that in Again the most enduring and popular version of the legend It's it contains it contains the the blood of Christ that was collected by Joseph of Arimathea And and I think I think helpful to understanding this is the reality that Something cosmic like you just described In the imaginary gets still distilled down to something that humble folk Love to live with in their universal history, I'll say it that way and so I think it's I think it's rather than just taking the trying to trying to Describe the cosmic. I think the the the Genius of this and the beauty of this is that it becomes this is what I think symbolism is supposed to do Yeah, makes the cosmic The cosmic real I mean, I mean this is scalable. This is why it's even dangerous. I think to talk about Forgive me nate, but you just used the the phrase just the sacrament of the Eucharist or something like that I was like there's nothing just about it, right? but you know, uh it's because it's Because it's layered so so closely in with the incarnation It's layered so closely in with this whole idea that that is fundamental to Any understanding of let's call it pre-modern christianity east or west or whatever, which is that? Uh created matter is good And then it has the capability of of mediating grace Right sacraments the things that you know Like the like the list of the seven sacraments in the west or something like that maybe do this in like really specific ways um uh and You know whereas You know, but but but all matter does this all matter is intended to do this This is why this is actually it's the function of creation, right is is so one of the things father father alexander schmemann always made a big deal of was um that it's not the you know Uh what we're doing in a sacrament is actually showing creation for what it what it actually is right revealing it as actually a theophany Right. This is what the world is supposed to be And sort of by abdicating our priestly responsibilities in eden Right, we sort of failed to reveal the world in this way But just just for people who are out there who are like kind of like new to like what is all the grail stuff about? um So around the year 1000 to 1400 We have these legends that start appearing in western europe and they have to do with something called the grail and the grail is this Really really elusive thing um, basically, it's a liturgical object either an altar or a bell, um, or a uh, or a chalice or sometimes a pattens which is Uh, kind of a liturgical plate that you would put bread on for the eucharist, uh, but it's basically it's a liturgical object Um and legends start sort of appearing around it. It starts showing up for instance in the pyrenees um shortly after the the cruce right around the same time as the the the third and fourth crusades Start showing up in the pyrenees. Um as as this uh, this image of the virgin mary holding a grail uh holding a chalice with sort of flames coming out of it in her hands and And um, the image starts showing up there It shows up in like celtic hagiography like and and uh sort of like say like wonder tales or miracle legends And then it also shows up ultimately it starts showing up in the troubadour tradition Of the medieval romance so romance means like an adventure story um, and uh, the troubadours were sort of this group of people who who were kind of lived on the border of of let's say, um, not old world new world, but uh the the the border of Basically the mediterranean and then western europe, right? Which was the old world new world back then right? And so you had these people who who came kind of from basically like the french mediterranean kind of area And they're picking up legends. They're picking up stuff that's coming back from the crusades They're picking up on all of these things, but then they're coming to Uh, they're coming to france mainly france, but then ultimately other places in europe Because some of the troubadours were actually kings of like founders the fairly important dynasties And so all of their kids sort of inherited this stuff um, and uh when they Uh, so you'd have somebody who was like a poet and a singer but also a crusader but also, you know The king of france, right? And so they come and they start disseminating these legends via Uh via basically epic poems or songs That were composed in the vernacular which was kind of a big deal Because all the really prestigious literature at the time is written in latin So to have somebody come on and actually, you know, this is ultimately the tradition that dante like his his group the sweet new style Which is the best rap group name? um, but like like his group this was part of this group group of poets called the the sweet new style and um, Uh, they they were basically doing you know doing epic stories and romances and things like this uh in in uh provincial latin, right? Uh, but even before that even for them though, you have the the arthurian stuff started to circulate and the interesting thing about the holy grail myths Is that they uh, they don't necessarily originate with king arthur, but they very quickly get caught up into the arthurian cycle um, because the arthurian cycle was the Um, i'm going to resist the urge to say it was the mcu of the middle ages Um, because I hate it when people say that but but but I mean the mcu The arthurian story was basically this I mean most arthurian legends are not legends about king arthur The oldest ones are like and the oldest ones are things like king arthur is fighting Uh fighting giants and becoming emperor of the romans and stuff like this But like most arthurian stories are not actually about king arthur. They're about things happening in his court it was sort of the container just like uh just like um You know charlotte mains court in in the in the matter of france, right? It's sort of the container where all these legendary people would be would be Gathered and actually most of the important arthurian stories are written by french people Uh, most of the important charlotte main stories are written by italian people right for something to be legendary It's because it happened over there, right? um Yeah, so anyway all that to say that the the myth of the holy grail very quickly starts getting um Kind of mixed and matched into the arthurian stuff and when it does so Uh, there are some early versions. Um, chretien de toiles Percival Uh, which is which is my favorite version That's the one that i've done, you know several videos with jonathan pageau on if people want to go watch those Um is is really the earliest But then the the but the one that yeah, yeah, the one that most people remember is sir robert de boron's robert de boron's uh grail epic which which basically Is the first place that solidifies the idea that it's this cup and then it's actually it's the cup that christ used at the last Supper right and so uh, which was which was then later used to catch The water and blood that you know streamed from his side of the crucifixion, right? And basically that's how you get to indiana jones in the last crusade And that's how you get to almost every version of the grail epic that we've gotten since then Is kind of based off of that and there were a bunch of later arthurian stuff Um, just to say a couple of quick things about the grail Uh, there there may be there may be three things that that most grail stories have in common regardless of who wrote them or when they were written um, and the first thing is that the grail has a feminine association, um Um, it it's usually uh carried by a virgin it's carried by a woman, um, it's uh You sort of feminine in the sense that it's like a container. It's a receptacle. It's a Uh, it's a place for manifesting body, right? So the grail always has this kind of feminine connotation and usually like in the visions in the grail chapels in the arthurian myths Um, it's being carried the grail itself is being carried by a young woman Um, the second thing to know about the grail is that it's extremely elusive Right. Uh, the whole thing with the grail is that you you know, you get really really close But you don't get to like maybe you get a vision or but you you'd never quite attain it in fact the only person who actually does attain it although again see my video on perceval because my whole argument is personal actually does attain the grail but um, But in a particular way in a particular way and the story bears that shape, right? Yeah, but there's a later, you know in the later version of the much later As when it comes along as part of the the lantelot what's what in french, uh in our thurian studies Is called the lantelot grail cycle? um Eventually, it's sir lantelot's son galahad. He's the only one who actually attains the grail And basically because of this he has to leave the world Right, so there's something about the grail. It's like well if you got it then uh, you're You're no longer You're sort of like too holy you're sort of like, you know Like in other words to attain the grail is kind of death, right a saintly death, but it's death And then the the last thing to sort of say about the grail Is that in all of its forms? It's connected to Uh, it's connected to basically the idea of of the body of christ, right his body and then even more specifically his blood, um, there was Probably we don't want to get into all of this but in the middle ages there was um a cult Not not a not a like, you know, whoo spooky cult but like cultus in the sense of like devotion, right? There was a a cult in the west of the holy blood, um And actually this shows up for instance in a lot of uh french and english, uh heraldry Uh where where sometimes if you look at the coats of arms of like, you know noble houses or whatnot You'll see there are like these three red drops of blood, right? um, there are actually kind of little references to the the three drops of blood in the um In the um Uh the principal story as well. Uh, but there's there's There was this cult of the holy blood and this basically, you know Like having a devotion to the blood of christ This is part of a larger set of devotions to what's sometimes called the vulnary of christ that is his wounds And this is the this is the like the ores source for instance of like the sacred heart devotion today um So anyway all that to say, uh This was a very popular devotion. In fact, uh devotional books for late people would very often have like Here's the here's a page that's just the exact dimensions of the side wound of christ so you could meditate on that or You know, and obviously there are uh, there are certain There's certain, you know famous churches in the the in western europe today, which actually still purport to to have the blood of christ if you've ever seen the uh the uh delightful family-friendly film in bruges you uh, you'll know what i'm talking about but um, anyway, please don't actually show that to your children, uh, so so anyway But you should watch it because it's a darn good movie it's a darn good movie, but it's yeah It's not family-friendly at all. Uh, but but I mean but actually like the blood of christ is like a kind of a Has an important role to play in that film. But anyway, so all of this to say one of the things that I thought was very interesting about the uh About the mrs. Davis at least as far as like kind of reading Again, just like reading the summary of it Is that they basically have all of the parts of the symbolism there But then it's demonically inverted and this is the thing that really freaks me out, right? Of course, there's a connection between mary and the grail Yes, of course. There's a feminine connection with the grail, right? um, of course It it happened the grail almost like like that's almost one of the best ways of understanding the grail is that the grail at some Level is representing the mystery of the divine feminine Which is why it is a mystery why it's hidden in the mystery of yeah, correct yes and then uh, which is also the body of christ, right and then you have the um And then you have the uh the this connection to the body, right? It's actually the skull of j or whatever, right? um It's apparently mary it's like a sithian tribes person who right drinks out of skull cups and then you have the This idea that if you attain it you die But in this case what they're trying to do is attain it which in this case means destroy it So what so jesus can die, right? So instead of instead of uh, here is a way that um God is sort of being revealed. He's being made manifest in the world and the and the the grail kind of represents this sort of This ephemeral theophany like you get really close and then it slips from your grasp again, but you're you're constantly pursuing, right? That's the thing you're constantly pursuing. What are you pursuing? You're pursuing communion with god. You're consuming pursuing knowledge of him Right and it goes from that to being a quest to actually get out of communion with god It goes to being this quest to how can I attain this thing so I can destroy it? So god can move on with his life and I can move on with mine Well, it's not a thing that freaked me out right and and jesus is not god In this in this well, yes in this show and Um, I think in many ways it's an it's an it's an atheistic In that it sort of echoes new atheism because the idea behind it is If we can get rid of god The world will be better because the grail is nothing but trouble And so isn't it interesting that it's the ai who's like here's the bargain You make god go away and i'll go away, too. Yes. Yeah And and in some ways it's sort of an inversion of you know, the the grail is sort of tolkien's ring in some ways In in mrs. Davis and it has to be thrown into the fires of mountain. Yeah. Yeah. No. Yeah, right And also it's uh, it's um, and given the inevitable connection between the grail and the church It's yeah, it's its association with selfishness Right. I think that at some point the boss who turns out to be you know Jesus's ogreish mother or whatever um that that That she says that the grail was Um created by selfishness. So it has to be destroyed by selflessness so christ so like The grail which should be this this presence of christ Selfless self-giving of himself, right? Which is what happens in the eucharist, which is what happens in communion right, there's no There's no just the sacrament of the eucharist to me again because and i'm not i'm well there is there is there is You're there is if you're if you have a western a western mind that has reduced what the fullness of the meaning of the Of the sacrament is yes Well, so but setting that aside like like this is the ultimate selfless self-giving of himself, right? And this is what all the grail knights this is basically what they have to You know if you look at the trials that the various grail knights have to go through in the different versions of the story um, uh tennyson's are actually some of my favorite, right, but they have to they have to They have to undergo Being you know, uh, uh, you know tempted in all these different ways what tempted by the world, right tempted by the the passions tempted by Themselves and they have to reject all of those things To get to the grail right and this is the flip side It's let me destroy the grail so I can get together with my ex and so That I can have my this and so that I can yeah, and it's just like very Again, like very much diabolical symbolism in the sense that let's take all the christian Like all this christian symbolic language and let's just turn it on its head Yeah So do you think I have to ask do you think do you think it was done consciously or do you think just the inversion happened? because Of the Whatever Of the uh, just the basic impulses of the of the the the screenwriter Is there a difference? Because that that I think is in some ways the power of The grail in that it is revelatory and what? How the grail is used in this story reveals in my opinion? The a spirit in this age. Yeah. Yeah, i'm not going to call it the spirit of this age We might call it the spirit of the air but a spirit in this age is revealed by How the grail functions in that story? right which I think is To me was an immensely powerful idea in terms of understanding the grail because There was this great. So when when ross douthat had um Eric weinstein on his podcast. Is that how you say his last name douthat? Okay. Yes, cool. It is. I never did I got corrected on that years ago Douthat so when oh actually was the other ways when eric weinstein had ross douthat on his podcast eric asked ross If jesus was today was around today. Don't you think he'd just be memed into oblivion? but I think What you see is in In christ and I think even in a sense in the grail because You know people are trying to meme this thing, but there's a level of truth that In a sense there there's no weapon formed No weapon formed against it will stand and I actually see that in this mrs. Davis thing because it is and and by using the grail in a sense it the the The story is revealed to be what it is and And so that to me was tremendously fascinating because You know the the question is well if jesus was around today Would he just sort of be memed into oblivion and I thought well first of all if you know the story You know the worst thing that they could do was you know crew, you know portray him as an insurgent and then treat him as such and then the point of the resurrection is No, even that won't work and And and this is part of why I think we see The enduring nature of christ and and all of this mystery and majesty that he You just can't kill him. I mean it's it's chester's observation that He seems to know the way out of the tomb like he knows the way out of being mean to death and And so then when I saw mrs. Davis and you know, I went back and listened to a bunch of these things about the grail Especially richard how you portrayed it in terms of why don't you talk a little bit about what you talked in the video about? because tom holland Tom holland sort of saw it as many do that He never attains the grail, but I think you nailed it and I think that's in fact how the grail functions Yeah, so at the very end of perceval's story. Um, i'll i'll i'll this is a thousand foot summary if you get in there There's a lot of really cool details, but uh, you can go watch the video if you want to um at the end of perceval's life, so basically he gets to the grail and I mean, this is the other thing that I should have mentioned about grail symbolism Is that the grail always prompts you to ask a question? um Uh sort of is a question or is the answer to a question? Well perceval doesn't know what the question is So when he's in the grail chapel, he fails to ask the question um and And as a result there's like a voice from heaven and like everybody's gone and like terrible and then he forgets who he is He loses his name. He loses his identity. He wanders through the wilderness for five years And all this stuff and finally finally finally he gets to the end of his story and uh, which by the way isn't or by the poem isn't about him most arthurian stories are using Uh, what a narrative technique called interlaced where you tell Three or four unrelated stories and they just are seemingly unrelated stories and they just cross over at various points in time and in the end you kind of see everything come back together, but um So but but the perceval portions of the story Perceval, uh has forgotten his name. He's wandering through the wilderness kind of doing nightly things, but with no purpose No, no memory of who he is no identity and then finally he comes across these um Comes across these these lords and ladies and they say hey What are you doing there going to go, you know going in armor right on today of all days? You're not allowed it's it's unlawful and perceval says what's today? And uh, they say well, it's good friday It's the day that jesus christ died And of course one of the one of the important parts of the symbolism of the story is that perceval has never been properly catechized And so, um, he's really even never been to church, which is one of the important details little subtle details in the story But uh, so he so he says well, it's the day that jesus christ died and and perceval's like I have no idea what you're talking about And so they said, okay. Well go down that away And when you you know go far enough and down this path You'll get to a hermit and you go to that hermit and that hermit will tell you everything that you need to know And so perceval goes to the hermit and the hermit essentially a few things happen the hermit reveals perceval's name to him he uh, he reveals his own identity as basically perceval's uncle, uh, which which heals the there's like a a loss of fatherhood is one of the The major themes in the story. So perceval perceval is like lost loss of fought lost fatherhood is sort of restored to him here And then perceval is is catechized and it actually runs through like very explicitly in the text here are the things and it's just Basically presenting the gospel. This is who jesus was this is what he did And then at the very end it's uh, he says stay with me for the next three days. Well, this is holy friday Um, so you do the math right he says stay with me for three days And uh eat what I eat. Well, if you know anything about Uh monastic practice in the middle ages You know that eat what I eat basically means you don't really eat almost anything at all except a little bread and a little water right, um, so stay with me eat what I eat for the next three days so The very last thing that said about perceval in the whole story is he stays with The hermit he eats what he eats and on the third on the third day He was he confessed his sins and he received communion and then the story says And we will we will say no more perceval in this story now there was other stuff in there There's a there's a an ending for gawain his character in that poem which uh, critian died before he could finish So we don't know how gawain's story is supposed to end but according to what critian wrote. That's the end of perceval's story so Actually the sort of like the losing the grail and forgetting who you are And then coming to church and remembering that's actually That is the grail story, right? That is the grail story. It's like being presented with this question Um to go back to the the bulgakov quote, you know You could say the story of adam is being presented with the world as sacrament being presented with the world as As a theophany right a revelation of god This is what I mean, you don't have to go to bulgakov for this You can go to say maximus right he talks about this, you know adam naming the animal Right. Yeah, i'm just saying like this goes way back this goes way back and um Revealing the sort of the world in this way and in that sense like it's actually the same thing For the blood of christ to drip down on the skull of adam, which is this sort of ancient christian legend Um, this is why golgotha is the place of the skull because you know There's there's a really old jewish letting legend predating christianity that that's the burial place of adam after the flood um And so this idea that the blood trickles down on the skull, right that renews adam But to renew adam is actually to renew the world This is why st paul says that creation is groaning in travail like a woman in childbirth, right? Waiting what waiting for the fulfillment the consummation the revelation of the sons of god um father dimitri staniloai in his wonderful wonderful Chapters on the resurrection. This is exactly what he talks about that in the moment of the resurrection the resurrection of the body Right the resurrection of the dead that creation itself will be transfigured like christ garments like the the you know, the the terrain around him was transformed at the moment of the transfiguration and Everything will kind of be revealed in that moment for being what it is, right? But so adam is supposed to basically like see the world in this way um And he fails to do that right that's perseval's failure is adam's fall Right. It's the failure to to really grasp the world in this way. And instead what's the thing that perseval? Why doesn't perseval ask the question? I mean, this is an important part of the story as well perseval doesn't ask the question because he's already been told By people he considers wise and important he's been told don't ask questions. You'll look stupid Well, what's the thing that adam? What is why do they eat the the fruit right? It's for the it's for knowledge, right? It's we don't want to be babies anymore. We want to you know, I know there's more to it than this but But but it's you know, a big part of it is we don't want to be babies anymore We want to you know, be like god no good and evil And um, we want to be seen to be like god. Yeah. Yeah, right. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, this is that's a that's an important distinction Yeah, for sure. You don't want to appear ignorant. Yeah, right. And so And so adam and eve right the eat the fruit they fall right? And so then the rest of life becomes this constant like getting really close You have all these theophanies throughout the old testament, right? These these these times when god comes close to us But it's like we can never get it right. It's always Alluding us right? Um, and so what's what's needed ultimately right is the incarnation, right? Um, And uh, that's where you know, the feminine aspect of the grail comes in right god has a body giving god a body Right and all this stuff that all this stuff All this stuff is involved. But anyway, so so just to say I think perceivable does get the grail at the end of the story, right? But it's but it's in a It's in a kind of a subtle way and I think to me it's actually much more compelling Than the later version of the story where like the grail night whoever the grail night is It kind of changes eventually becomes gala had gala has boring. Yeah gala hod's gala hat is like the hot new thing Gala is like a christian superhero. He's totally boring Well, I mean, I I think some of the gala had stories are actually quite amusing. I know I love i love malcolm gight and he's a he's a gala hat guy, but I just the gala hat I think gala had I think some of the gala had stories are quite fun. But uh, uh, but but also like the very like the the The fairy tale timeline on like okay exactly how old is lancelot because you know, he's got a full-grown son running, you know but anyway, um so I I I but but to me this version of the story, which is you do get The grail, but what does getting the grail means? It means like you've got to go do what any You know six-year-old kid would do Right. That's the that's the thing and that's the proper inversion, right? The proper inversion which is an inversion of the self which is a humbling of the self right self, right? um You know as opposed to the sort of like now i've achieved the grail and now i'm just i'm too good for this world I have to be taken away like There's something to that i'm not saying that's like a wrong Idea or like not a legitimate christian symbol or anything like that, but I but the sort of the subtle way that this is handled And there's a lot more to the perceval story, which I didn't even get to in that video I have a book that someday maybe i'll finish Um, but but it's it's it's like my crazy, you know, like conspiracy theory theory pin, you know You know pins and string and everything on the wall like it's it's that project. It's that project for me But uh, yeah, what I would say is that if you get um If you get If you pay close attention to perceval story The the the arc is very very It's just very subtly done And if you pay attention to naming the story if you pay attention to clothing removing new garments putting old garments putting new ones on right? There's this whole thing early on in the first half of the story for instance that has to do with Perceval basically getting power-ups. He gets progressively like better suits of armor because he kills people and he takes their armor, right? But then actually the thing he has and and that's part of his maturity is he's moving up the hierarchy of society Um is he gets these better suits of armor he gets these new cloaks all the stuff But then when he gets the very end of the story, he has to take it all off and he goes back to wearing the the Like this the basically the sackcloth, you know like the that he'd started the story in right because he started out He was poor. He was a savage. He didn't know anything etc And he's got to be stripped of all of those things So that he can come to the grail Is that connection between the child and the sage? Yeah, yeah Well, yeah, it's a really powerful story and and I you know when I mean I really loved how you worked that richard and when I saw that I could begin to I could begin to I had a much better understanding of What the grail is how it functions in these stories how it reveals? And and then when I listened to it, I thought and i'm thinking about sort of the transition You know why the grail and tom holland works on this a little bit I don't think he gets it quite right But I think it's why the grail appears when it does I think it has a lot to do with This process that will lead to modernity Obviously around the time of the protestant reformation, but the protestant reformation is an instantiation of this. It's it's the it's the You know one of the things I know that I'm phrasing it this way, but it's the symptom It's uh, it's the like the world is headed in a certain direction and that makes it possible for the reformation to happen the way That it happens Right like go ahead western church had plenty of reforms before that moment that that didn't Didn't fracture in that way, right? And I think an interesting contrast to these grail legends, especially as you've sort of Lay them out richard would be say bunion's pilgrim's progress when you sort of Put those things next to each other a whole bunch of very interesting things sort of becomes illuminated On a lot of different levels. Yeah um storytelling development of storytelling because you know when you when you understand at least your interpretation of You know did did perseville? Achieve the grail. Yes But but what you don't see is a picture of him standing it with his hand or any of this nonsense That's going on in the indiana jones movie. Yeah, because that is a failure to simply understand storytelling and how you can use these stories, um these What are we going to call them universal mythology universal history stories fairy stories legends how you can understand how these stories communicate the ineffable I mean the whole the whole point is I mean all gospel preaching if I can switch into a protestant metaphor here Is to communicate the ineffable that thing that the that the angels can't get enough of looking at into Flesh and that then obviously it's in the incarnation. It's in christian conversion I mean the point of it is to You know here I want to show you what the gospel is about Let me tell you a story about and there's a grail in it and of course today we think about What would that be about? But of course bunion is going to use a very different situation Yeah, I I think that the impact mostly for ill of pilgrim's progress on storytelling Is difficult to underestimate. I really struggle with this as as as like a western literary tradition appreciator, you know um, you know like well obviously you've got to read pilgrim's progress like you you got to read it to understand things that Are going on in england at the time and all this different stuff, but then like also Man even okay, so When you did your first video on mrs. Davis Uh, or maybe it was your only one. I don't know. Anyway when I watched it I did a first one and a second one and okay. Yeah, I Watched I don't know But anyway, whichever one I watched when I watched your video I think it was your first one because you were responding to bishop baron and uh, you know and and you were responding to him talking about like the intimacy between like a religious sister and christ and like I gotta say There's something about all of that that really wigs me out uh, and this is not just a oh my my my modern wasp, uh, uh, uh Sensibilities have been shocked, etc, etc um Even like from a pre-modern, you know standpoint from an orthodox standpoint, whatever like that stuff wigs me out And it's not because there isn't language Even in the scriptures itself like of divine eros, right? Yeah, I have no problem with that but what everybody should know and yet Thanks in part to bunion, you know, like we've we've kind of Kind of kind of i'll try to explain the connection a minute because maybe it's not immediately obvious But what everybody should know is that there are some kinds of intimacy Which it is simply not appropriate to air in a public forum Right doesn't mean that it it it doesn't mean that language isn't there, right? It doesn't mean that we're not always the bride to christ bridegroom, right? Doesn't it doesn't mean that that language is completely inappropriate because obviously you've got the song of songs and you've got You know other stuff in the christian mystical tradition but like You can't show it on tv, man Like you can't you can't uncover the mystery, right? And this goes back to like the whole thing of the grail is right It's that is this mystery and part of that mystery is the divine feminine Which is the church and part of that mystery is like intimacy and all those different things And that's why the grail is covered like even in the in the orthodox church when we bring the chalice out we cover it like like the whole you know the whole idea of like um, and i'm I am not trying to pick on anybody So I hope people will hear this in good faith but just from an orthodox standpoint to take the eucharist and put it in a monstrance and then let's Go on a parade is like Bro, like it's a little like it's a little shocking. Why because we have this impulse to cover a mystery, right? that that You know, so so it's richard. It's interesting. I know I know you're not a fan I know you're not a fan of a weight, but one of the things that weight does suggest I'm not not a fan of weight. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. I he's a little he's a little He's a little wacky. I I like mackin better than weight, but but I okay Okay, but I believe I believe I believe weight actually suggests at one point if i'm recalling that one of the potential sources of inspiration for The grail stories coming into the west when they did is observation of the eastern right Yeah, that's so this is that's his kind of main argument. So weights for people to know a weight was sort of a british like occultist Spiritualist kind of christian mystic but like kind of let's say played around with like some some circles that make me a little itchy And he was a christian hermeticist to yeah to put it mildly Yeah, it but but weight, um a big part of his argument is that uh, the grail is You know the grailness or at least the celtic grailness are the survival of like a missing celtic epiclesis So the epiclesis is the moment in the in eastern liturgies when the holy spirit is called down upon the gifts And we ask god to change them, right? And this is something it's a feature of eastern liturgies it's not really a feature of surviving western liturgies, but weight thought that there maybe was one that had been in like the old kind of celtic mass That was obliterated by and a lot of people thought this not just weight, but that was that was that was like, you know anyway, long story short, um, yeah, he says that uh, he says that maybe one of the sources of the grail is the Is is crusaders or whoever haven't come back having observed eastern liturgies and and there's no way this isn't true By the way, like there's there's no way that that is not a part of things I mean in in our videos with with pageau I went into a lot of detail about the connection between like the holy face of the blue care night church And the great entrance to the divine liturgy and all these different things like that's definitely a part I would never say that's the only thing because it's like the thing about the grail is is because it's a container Right. It actually like it actually attracts origin stories and they become true. So it's like Anyway, but but anyway all that to say all that to say Uh, there is what is sometimes called the byzantine school of grail studies And it's people just looking at connections between the grail legends and like eastern liturgies. And so there's that's definitely Well, that can't be it. Well, that can't be the full explanation because as you just went through a painstaking effort to explain earlier The the person holding the grail object is always a woman Right. Yeah, so that makes it impossible for it to be a one-to-one Representation. Yeah, no, no, no, it's not it's not one-to-one. It's more like Yeah, it's it's not like that. It's it's it's it's not one-to-one. But that one-to-one approach is Sorry kids are yelling that one-to-one approach is Exactly what bunion did for symbolic storytelling and this is where I loop back around to you This is my axe grind Okay, right is that the the grail always eludes being a one-to-one So if I just said well the grail is just one-to-one, you know the byzantine divine liturgy or whatever then But but but it won't do that, right and and you can do the same thing Well, oh the grail is just these celtic myths. It wouldn't be a mystery as well Yeah, the grail is just these celtic myths that got christianized but it won't do that right like it's it's more than it's It's more than it's more than any kind of a reductive reading could try to make it and um Uh, but what so what bunion did was to take the quest narrative? but to sort of like give everything a very bald one-to-one correspondence and To uh to sort of like to eliminate the mystery, right? So then it's like, okay, so you're in the dungeon of giant despair But you have a key called hope and it opens all locks. Well, okay There's nothing else for me to think about now Like thanks for explaining all of that Um, and in this in this sense bunion isn't he's not inventing something new He's kind of picking up from like some of the worst medieval authors people nobody remembers because their stories were boring um, but then but then it it just becomes a it becomes like sort of this linchpin of What's What we as modern people are going to come to mean by symbolism, right? And this is why it's so darn hard To like explain this to like your evangelical grandma or something like this and you're like well grandma it's you know, this or this and and she's like well, but uh, I I have examples in my mind, but because they involve real people I don't want to use them But but this is why this is why trying to explain symbolism if somebody's stuck in this Like one-to-one correspondence mode, um Why it becomes really difficult and this is also why we're not attentive to it when the enemy does it Right is because we're looking for just a we're like, oh, well, here's a That's not to pick on bishop baron But like oh, oh here's here's a a a religious sister and she has a romantic relationship with jesus Oh, well, that's like just like teresa of avila or whatever, right? Uh, and and and so then we're like, well, okay. Yeah boom done and dusted, you know I guess we're cool with that, right? But then But there's more going on here, right? There's more going on in that relationship, right? That actually you find out that this is actually like a uh, it's a toxic relationship that For both of their sakes they need a divorce, right? And it's So like once you start once you start really kind of thinking a little more carefully about What's going on? Um It becomes pretty clear that it's it's a diabolical symbolism So I talked a bunch. I'm really sorry, please No, I I agree with you entirely on that point for sure and I You know to me what's and i'm glad we agree that the that the grail cannot be easily reduced to a one-to-one Yeah, and I i'm certainly not trying to do that in the videos that pageau and I did together the thing that the thing to understand about those videos is That is that we're sort of laying out Basically like three or four different sources Right and then talking about how Let's how like somebody like kretian what he does with all of those sources to kind of bring them together into the mass um, but it's certainly not certainly not to say that the grail is only about That I mean like Technically speaking everything is about the mass. Yeah, you can you can never be right, right exactly So if you're saying it's all about the liturgy You can never be wrong when you're saying that because that's just the structure of everything right? Right. Yeah, this could be but but but I don't want to say that this is the only interpretive lens Like you could use the grail in a story that's not about that and you could still use it in a proper way. Yeah It's hard to think of stories that do this. Well, I mean the last crusade does it pretty well actually Um now the symbolism is like a lot more Um, because we don't have the knack anymore for You know the major thing that I was missing that I don't remember you saying maybe you did say it in the pagio conversations But I don't remember you Talking about the connection between the grail and the divine feminine Like that's the part that I really felt was like hey, we referenced it, but we didn't talk about it It's been a while since I saw them so I mean it may just been a part of it I just glossed over and we did talk about we did talk about actually we started our conversation with a Discussion about this very important book called the virgin and the grail And we talked about the connection between the mother of god and the grail and some of that but some of the divine feminine stuff We didn't talk about um, there are still things about it that I would like to say but um, i'm not Ready to say them on the internet yet. But um, but yeah, there's there's definitely There's definitely let me know when you are ready to say them, okay Because real country would be a very good place to yeah for sure for sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but but but but but I mean honestly when it comes to things like um When it comes to things like discussing the feminine Uh, and you know even discussing the eucharist or something like that. I'm just really uncomfortable For for all of the reasons that we just talked about about sort of veiling the mystery, right? I'm really uncomfortable like getting into some of that stuff in a really open forum That's more like a buy me three beers and i'll We'll we'll you know, we'll get into it kind of a situation. So absolutely. Yeah Yeah, so anyway people you can buy me beer and i'll talk to you. That's Well and off and off the internet and off the internet Yeah, and you know that that even gets into your part of your point about veiling as well that one of the things that we're continuing to try to figure out is What is appropriate for the internet now that sounds crazy? Because what we've done as a culture is thrown everything onto the internet that we could and Part of what we begin to see is that um, no not everything should be on the internet by the way And we're gonna have to work that out. I you know for me I mean, obviously there's the there's the interest The there's the There's the interest in mystery For whatever the motivation for mystery itself is and i'm less interested in that um, I am more interested in So so the west takes this turn and Everything sort of becomes flat And and and bunion is if we if we let's say compare the grail stories to bunion Yeah, everything becomes flat everything becomes a one-to-one correspondence. I mean that's deeply modern that's that that that Is in some ways a reflection of modernity's assumption of truth Um, and all the verveky stuff we talked about in terms of propositional tyranny, you know everything this means this this means this Everything is sort of in these little little amazon boxes You can go all the way to the beginning of maps of meaning the world is a forum for objects And that's very much the the modern mind and that then gets reflected in the storytelling that gets reflected in the church um, but then again, of course what happens in the reformation with respect to the eucharist gets very interesting because of course the zwingli and fringe has it as a symbol and um You get the famous famous beer and pretzels mass and all that stuff Yeah and and so I think so so now to sort of come back around to This moment that we're at now when we're talking about you know, you and jonathan are doing your series on universal history and um, You know some like chris cavanaugh are watching it and and saying that's just you know basically, these are grifters Because and he doesn't I can say it better than he can because If there's no there's no grift like the religious grift, let's say that Uh, because people are enormously susceptible to this kind of grifting um but part of what we're And I think jonathan is correct when he said A number of years ago. We couldn't be having these conversations like we're having them now Now Because I think again modernity is continuing to recede and the difficulty that we're having is um articulating and understanding How to talk about this not just in a way that people Are connecting to finding helpful and finding i'll use the word. I don't love the phrase life-giving because when I look at What has been you know, what has happened over the last five years with respect to people finding faith again? and and many of those people finding faith in traditions that are Extremely sacramental the catholic and the orthodox traditions Um your joke about anglicanism and young restless and reformed was hilarious richard Please forgive me. I I you know, I'm I don't i'm not the guy who who? anyway, but but that It's i'm a very i'm a very anglican catholic anglican and i'm very excited that our new rector has similar Has similar leanings and is gradually transforming our liturgy Yeah, no, no the the joke that I made on twitter wasn't that the expense of anglicanism It was that um all of the and I I wasn't young restless reform myself But I was I had a bunch of friends who were and was kind of adjacent to those circles And the joke is that all of the young restless reformed are now old tired and anglican um Which which is definitely the the case for all the guys that I can think of so Well, and and I should mention my friend who so we planted a bunch of churches in sacramento around the turn of the millennium Um and in the early aughts and all of those churches are now except my church because for reasons particular to my church They all have weekly Uh communion they call it the eucharist. They have quite a bit more liturgy They're they're in the christian reform church, they're really leaning towards um, you know Neosacramental but one of my church planter pastors had said also All the people that left my church that said they wanted to go to orthodoxy None of them actually go to church and so that's an issue too. Yeah, sure I think uh, well I think chris green I think one of the reasons he ended up becoming Anglican he's now an anglican bishop in a continuing anglican movement Is his interest in In the sacrament i'd like because he I mean he did his he did his whole study on uh, you know the uh, the view of the of the uh, Eucharist in the in the early pentecostal movement and I think that's what led him directly into a To a more liturgical tradition But all of this is moving towards I mean richard you also made a comment to I think it was to grim grizz about you know if Basically what I heard through your comment to him or to me. I don't remember which was You need you need a church that's not only going to keep your attention that's sort of you know Sort of a shallow way of saying it But you need a church that you can continue to swim to the bottom and never find it Yeah And there's a sense in which Bunyan as seen in that storytelling. Oh, i'm in the i'm in the dungeon of despair Oh, here's the key of hope click out I go um that's And I think part of the reason modernity is bottoming out we're having all these conversations about metamodern and we're trying to get words around it and all is that we simply we We bottomed out at the it's not the it's nihilism that we hit this bottom Yeah, that it's and and now we realize no I need Um, I need a pool that's deeper than I And and of course you find that in you know, that's why you're looking for god and and so what we're and so then when I of course i'm a pastor and so my job is Is is not simply to enjoy deep water. Yeah, my job is to help people um Expand their capacity And their hunger and their desire For the riches and depth and the and for and for not idolatry is basically You know, I love the gene wilder willy wonka It was a wonderful show about idolatry because all of these children basically sold their birthright to cheap like esau And and what you do as a pastor is when someone sort of grabs onto something that is working for them now you say I'm glad that's working for you now I don't know how long that's going to keep working for you So when you're when you're tired of this or you're finding it wanting or you've you found the end of it Let's let's talk more and talk about um, let's point you to Where you can go next and I think this is a lot of where things are going I think that something anybody who's like thinking about converting to orthodoxy or something else Um is that something that's really important that you need to be able to distinguish between is horizontal and vertical movement um so At the church, I mean we in our long conversation I talked a little bit about the church that I pastored for a few years and where where I was on staff and We had a lot of people there who were not actually, you know baptists in any sense, you know confessionally speaking right, but they were just there because uh, because basically we you know Supported the the life lifestyle decisions, you know conservative homeschooling etc that uh that they were You know that they had chosen and and so it was sort of like here's the identity that i've chosen and here's a place That lets me do it and now i'm gonna Uh, but the problem is that something like that is a lateral movement, right? You sort of like you move into it from something else and then when it stops serving that purpose You just move laterally onto the next thing right and so The people that i've seen and i've been orthodox long enough now to see You know people who were you know received before me people who were catechized at the same time as me people who have come in Since me right to see people again, you know, thank god not a lot but um To see people who have who have left And the reason that they've left is because they sort of never stop moving laterally, right? and so when they're you know When there's a scandal in the church or when there's like a boomer who really gets on your nerves at coffee hour or when there's a You know, I don't know whatever like one of you know, any one of these things happening like when that stuff happens Like it's very easy to just sort of say Uh, or you know, I want to become orthodox But then it turns out that orthodoxy is weird and hard and like all these different, you know And so it becomes very easy to just sort of say well, i'll just kind of i'll keep on moving, right? Um And instead of sort of saying actually, you know, the resistance is a good thing This is a helpful thing what I need to actually do is dig down Right and understand that this wasn't an aesthetic choice And that this wasn't for the memes and that this wasn't for you know, the the lifestyle but but it's actually it's for christ and and to sort of like Begin your you know, you could say like swim to the bottom or you could say begin your climb to the top, right? Jesus does both so why can't you but um, but like to to To sort of say all right now that i'm here at the foot of the mountain instead of like Going and trying out these other mountains now. I'm going to start my climb to the top and that's that's what I would just say Is that when you're converting? you know Just you know people should we should just be very careful and make sure that we understand Uh, you know I'm making this lateral movement, but if I keep moving laterally Then I fall into like a very particular kind of sin which is Which is related to like asidya or boredom, right? And this is one of the main things like every monastic manual ever written You could go with the rule of saint benedict or pretty much any eastern manual. It doesn't matter Every monastic manual ever written is written To bad monks, right? Because good monks obviously wouldn't need a manual right, um and And usually it's written to people who are They try this for a little bit and they they're at this monastery or whatever and then they you know living under this rule But then they get a little bored and they move on and then you know, saint benedict You know in his time people had sort of figured out that you could kind of live as an itinerant monk Just going from like house to house you show up in the village and everybody's like, oh, here's this great man of god Let's show him a good time And then kind of whenever you wear out your welcome you move on to the next place and so this kind of like wandering from Spiritual home to spiritual home to spiritual home or whatever like this is actually Incredibly spiritually dangerous even the Because you're at essentially when you're doing when you're when you're moving around that way the essential question you're asking As you're doing that is how does this serve me? Right, um, how am I being fed? How does this serve me instead of asking? How can I serve? So to bring it it's all if you're having the mentality of like being the question how can I serve? Being it almost doesn't matter where you are If that's the question that you have like almost any almost any church Will end up being suited to you if your question is how can I serve? Yep so what's really interesting is that the grail question the question that Percival fails to ask is Who serves the grail I might have put it in that way for a reason yeah In other words like who is the grail serving You know, who's this for what's in it? What's going on? Right? And that's the that's the sort of like if you can properly answer that question You know as well as you can on this side of paradise Right. That's the that's the question. That's Then your own identity is going to be Then your own identity is going to be revealed but actually in that particular the the answer to that question When Percival is supposed to ask it but fails to is that it's not serving him It's serving the wounded king Who were strongly led to believe is also Percival's father right, and so this there's this like missing sense of like fatherhood and identity and in the in the middle ages they They they Connected this image of the wounded king who is also your father, right with christ As he was brought down off the cross and laid on the stone of preparation, which is one of the ur sources for the grail and when they um And you know, there's there's like the the the you know Lulé lulé the falcon hath borne my mate away my Make or my mate away. I forget what the name of that particular carol is right now, but You can go look it up uh, but they basically they they take the um They take the all of those things and and kind of layer them together. Um, and I did a um Um, I did a I wrote a poem a few years ago And I don't know if I read it on those videos with pageo probably not because it's not the thing sort of thing I would do but uh, but I wrote a poem a few years ago Uh, the basically about this trying to take you know, Percival's image of like being in the ruined minster, right? The what's a minster? It's a monastery church, right? But why is it ruined because nobody's there taking care of it, right? Why aren't they there because things got hard and they left? Right, you know, so like he's in there and he sees this vision or you know, like the statue like the pieta right of Here's mary and here's jesus Has no idea what's going on. He has no context for what's going on. He doesn't understand So he just leaves he doesn't understand it. But actually that's the same image that he later sees in the grail chapel and that's the um That's the sort of like if he could understand what was going on there then His his father would be revealed to him. And of course at the end of the day God is your father. The church is your mother, right? um That got his father would be revealed to him and then he would have learned his name right And um, so yeah. Yeah, and of course in wolfram's version of the of the grail story The Parzival he doesn't he doesn't achieve the grail but he comes master of the grail castle. Yeah, so he ends up serving the grail Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and I and I so I think you know part of this moment so As as we're seeing this transition and as I watch The The the the parts of the corner here I think that I think the proper I I think the the mission is correct to tell better stories uh part of what we're doing is um, I think helping Make the old stories accessible. I think richard. That's what you and jonathan are really doing well You're helping make the old stories accessible. I you know when we visited the um The church in the chino conference, um, I was I'll say it here. I was disappointed because I know I don't want to disrespect anyone here, but my my preference would have been to have just toured the church church with jonathan because jonathan is extremely skilled at Sort of giving me a tour Because when I walk in of course i'm coming in with You know my how i've been formed And and and with a lot of ignorance too a lot of a lot of uh, two cvs in there You didn't have this Two cvs. I don't know in the in the cool hip reform circles. I grew up in pastor paul The two cv was short was shorthand uh that the young people used for a second commandment violation oh two cvs oh I I did not grow up in a cool reformed background. I grew up in a I I grew up in in the christian reform church. It wasn't cool. It was definitely reformed But it's not reformed enough for a lot of the cool reform kids. You didn't have like cool slang It's a in my experience. It's a very smart nerdy denomination What's that name? I couldn't quite hear you. I said in my experience. It's a very smart nerdy denomination at least in the interactions i've had With christian reform people it's kind of intense that way. Yeah, so I have no like The first time I came into a christian reform church was like I was able to strike up conversations right away. Yeah Yeah, it's it's a church that was diligent I mean until about 20 30 years ago It catechized its youth It had discipline. Um it it was a church that was disciplined or diligent some of that has been lost and and so we're obviously still working through a lot of those transitions, but the um The the you know what what i've what i've appreciated and where I want to you know part of the reason every time you guys do a universal history video I watch Is because not only do I want to grow an understanding But there is still another move that needs to be made on one hand The old stories are enduring and have endured for a reason um, you know, there's a there's sort of an evolutionary tell with respect to these things that so it's um The scene to leave talks about the lindy effect. These things are still around right because they work I'm a big believer in that general concept. Yep. Yep. Yeah, it's hard It's sort of hard to articulate but I think we know what we're talking about but at the same time another aspect of this tradition though is the fact that Almost everything that we have today Has been reworked by someone and usually You know if you listen to let's say the rest is history Well, there's some children's book that you got and now you might look at that children's book as that was kind of a dumb children's book because you know, I first heard about the grail with indiana jones and on one hand There's a world you can critique about that movie But there's a few little things in there that you look at. I think I think as like far as grail things go like it's pretty Like I would be very hard pressed to like find a better pop culture Take on the grail right now, right? Yeah, but but but part of the point is that um Like a like a tradition They do need to be maintained Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and you can see that with a building, you know, let's say you you you find a Building that's centuries old You know every restorer has to deal with Decisions that you can't There's no good answer for You know, how do what what does it mean to actually restore a painting? Because when you start getting into the details of that you begin to learn There's there's no real restoring it anything I do will in some ways Involve some levels of violation in order to achieve some levels of illumination and revelation And so, you know when I when I look around I these are my questions, especially as a pastor because I want to I want to do some restoration that will involve some violation But hopefully lead to some illumination and revelation. So I don't know if that makes any sense. Yeah I I um I have a sort of a a a project in hand of trying to do some some retelling of the grail story to kind of Uh, as you said like maintain the tradition so to speak um So and i've been talking with jonathan about it. So we'll see what happens. I have some other Publication deadlines I gotta hit first, but um, I do have something in mind Okay Um, shall we take questions from the chat dare we? All right. So if you have a question Just put in all caps question And uh, i'll be able to see it and and cite it and then we can we can we can take a look at it Um, I should I should show Upcycle thank you for your super chat. Um, I did I also noticed we're all wearing these blue shirts um And I think actually chad's chad's question earlier Was good. Why can't I just be interested in regular life with normal characters? well C. S. Lewis said you've never met a normal an ordinary person so Yeah, i'm glad you brought out c. S. Lewis because there was actually when you were when the whole discussion over bunion was going on I was thinking I was thinking that like I wanted to say something then about I think that Like tolkien kind of accuses lewis of doing the kind of storytelling that bunion was doing and kind of misses The depths of what actually what lewis was actually doing which it was kind of to destroy To destroy to restore the depths and the weirdness Although I just it's a small detail Tolkien was not as critical as people remember Um, there's more context and nuance in there kind of back and forth on all that stuff. Um But anyway, but but yes, like I I agree Tolkien was wrong about narnia um, if you want to get my if you want to get my like take on actually how brilliant the world building in arty is people can go listen to my conversation with gris because um, I I kind of nerded out for a little bit about that, but Anyway, forgive me. All right on to the questions. This is what we need to know richard Uh this morning it was gi training. Um, so typically speaking I do sort of two days no gi and then one day gi Um, and then when it gets really cold, maybe we'll switch it up We'll see what the coach wants to do, but uh, it was gi this morning Um, I had some roles with some awesome people. It was a lot of fun. Uh Uh, and yeah at some point I I actually think that I mean it looks like it's a it looks like it's a shiner or something But it's actually an abrasion. I think it's actually a gi burn At some point maybe got somebody's arm across my face or something like that. All right, so that that now is answered good next question What does the girl have to do with fatherhood you guys are all daddies Man, is there a more comfortable way we could phrase that you guys are all fathers. You guys are all Uh, I don't know. Okay. All right. Sorry Too much time on the internet I'll let you guys go first I well, okay. Um There's a way and this is going to get down to phlebas's question, which is a protestant question Which is I think for for me as a protestant who remains who remains happily a protestant I know I I sometimes get heat from some of my protestants because they think I don't defend the tribe enough um but I there is there is a way and and and actually when nate Let off the the stream with his reading All fatherhood is in christ Hopefully pointing our children towards the grail And um, and I would say motherhood does as well fatherhood and motherhood does so within their own Domains or their own spheres if I want to use a kyperian word but um It i'll make another point that when I was Doing the video on feminism earlier this week and looking at abigail favalli's Work Um, i've noted that for all of these for for many of these post-feminist writers like mary herrington um um louise perry abigail favalli it was childbearing and childbirth and mothering that all of them point to as This shook my Embrace of feminism as I knew it and drove me to reconsider actually last night We had a terrific asteroid meeting here at living stones and my little subgroup got into mother maiden mother Matriarch and one of the women of the group said yeah I feel like what my life has been has been maiden man Mother and she's not a mother yet, but um So yes, I i'd say it's not coincidence, but even though none of us have had um, i've had to bear children as fathers Fathering leads us to I think understanding If you father like this sort of one-to-one correspondence. Oh son you have despair. Here's the key of hope No, it's not good fathering. So So I have I have a couple things that I want to say. Um, so first of all the grail stories are are always in uh, in a context that is uh tales of chivalry and more broadly speaking so there's a way in which the The stories are also about the proper relationship between masculine and feminine And I would say if you really want to get dive deep into the question of like What does what does the grill have to do with fatherhood? I would recommend uh the christian union's Robert a johnson's book he Because he reads the grail stories is also uh a story about Being a masculine person And what the meaning of that is And it's proper relationship to the feminine So I think there's it the grail stories have a lot to say about fatherhood and all other aspects of proper masculinity And I would look I would direct you toward it's a very short book It's like I think it's only about 100 pages long and it's a very easy read All right good. Um Go ahead just to say to that real quick. Um One of the things that would have happened if perseval had asked the question Is that the the wounded king who was his father would have been healed? Um One of the things That the last crusade gets deeply right Is that the grail is about? Healing your father and I know there's a lot of jern peterson you know aficionados out there right the whole like rescue your father from the underworld kind of a thing right this is I don't know if it's quite the same but it's it's a related let's say it's at least related symbolism right this idea of of healing your father that this is what the uh the grail has the capacity among other things to bring you into A a healed relationship with not just your father but with tradition Um, you know the jonathan has said this many times on this channel, right? But the honor your father and mother doesn't just mean It doesn't just mean you know, like, you know obey your parents or whatever But but you honor your father and mother honoring your father and mother means honoring your fathers and mothers, right? Chesterton said tradition is giving the dead a vote, right? So the uh I think that part of the reason the grail quest is is kind of Resurfacing in the way that it is right now, which it seems to do every few years Every generation or two, you know, it has a big moment is because One of the things like the quest for the grail is about is about Finding your mother so that you can heal your father, right? It's about it's about pursuit of the tradition and the feminine way that it's embodied So that your relationship with the masculine aspect of it can be healed. Um, That's a i'm not saying that well, but anyway The grail story is about healing your father. So there you go Uh, why the blue? Um, I I I didn't tell everyone to wear blue. There was no memo. It's mary's color next question is I think Phlebas do you believe in a physical grail? I kiss it every sunday I don't know. Maybe i'll go to monserrat and find out See and I and phlebas actually because of course, I know you a bit because you're you're one of the the real main people around here in some ways Um, and I think nate's the the the piece that nate read at the beginning Which I know lost a whole bunch of people because you're like, well, uh, well, where where is this going? um, but the point of that is gets into the question of Why the creation and why the incarnation? Because what is what is physicality for? For and even from reforms because I know because you grew up crc. I know that It's you know, why why did god make the world for his glory? Physicality is for glory yet Um, and and again, we are christians. So we believe in resurrection So it's not it's not gnostic in that we when we die we have finally Shuffled off our physicality and will now join the ethereal. No, it's The the god's quest is how much glory can this matter? Um, can this matter? embody And we've only begun that journey So, um, if the question is like do I believe in relics? hundred percent um Yeah, um, you know, i'm not saying I know like where the the grail is or something like that But but also like the grail itself is like, uh, right Well, it's the the grail is the stone of preparation, right? The grail is also the icon of the holy face. The grail is also the chalice of the last supper The grail is also like is all these things Right. Um, so in that sense, yeah, totally you can go to Jerusalem and see see a bunch of this stuff All right Question the under 130 iq here and i'm still unclear on what the grail is Can anyone on the panel summarize it for a fourth grade level? I tried to do that earlier But I guess I failed. Um It's a holy cup that contained at some point the blood of jesus and it's the uh, it's the Object of a bunch of important quest stories in medieval literature most of which have to do with king arthur See see now there's developmental levels because and because homeschoolers get a very good sense of if they're under a third if they're in third grade still Um, how do you explain it and you explain it in a way that a third grader can know say Oh, here's the grail and then there's the grail and then at some point they'll say wait a minute daddy I thought the grail was a cup And this is where you begin to learn and you see it in narnia. Yeah, lewis builds this into the story But I know I don't start out with my children. Um We I I don't start out by trying to give them the nuanced version of stories. I just like, you know Here's a saint story. Here's a bible story, whatever like when you're older we can You know, um, but but it's really important if you cannot appreciate the story On it's sort of like uh, like on a naive level. Um uh I um One of my joshua gibbs who's a classical educator and just a wonderful writer. He calls this high credulity So you start out by reading the stuff from a place of high credulity if I read in a legend That saint augustin of canterbury was thinking about turning home And then saint peter appeared to him a dream in a dream and flogged him for his his lack of zeal then uh My first response should not be now. What can this possibly mean? Right. We start out by just reading it as well Saint peter appeared to saint augustin of canterbury in a dream and flogged him for his lack of zeal And then you know just sort of like you can go from there But if you don't start there, this is one of the things that low key. This is one of the main goals of The universal history project, but we have to do it backwards Um because we have to help people like kind of step back into this stuff, right? If I tell you saint george killed a dragon then people go well, okay But what is it? but if I start out with well dragons mean this and symbolize this and it's like the You know the galaxy brain brain meme right where you start out with saint george killed the dragon and then saint george Uh killed a demon in the form of the dragon and then saint george killed, you know, like this is actually Not a thing that happened historically. It's just symbolic of all these different things and then it's dragons symbolize this and the very end Of the meme it's saint george killed the dragon, right? Um, like if you can get to that point, right basically if you can have the faith of a little child then We can begin so great good answer question is is richard familiar with michael Pullman zansky's orthodox dogmatic theology and its criticism of soliev and his eternal feminine ideals Taken up by bugatti. This is not anything i'm available to answer. Yes, I am There we go. We got a yes I'm happy to talk about that. Maybe some other time It would be a lot to go into right here. But yes, i'm i'm pretty familiar with all that stuff. All right professor luigi I just finished listening to all the chronicles of narnia and i'm currently digesting The sort of lesson that lewis was communicating. It's obviously not bunion ish allegory any thoughts I agree And I think richard does too I I go ahead go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. No, I was going to say It's helpful to take a look at lewis's a pilgrim's regress And which is of of lewis's books not one that often gets a lot of appreciation I was you honestly you get like a little cred even being familiar with it Yeah, I was recently rereading it and and my appreciation of it grew um but and and when I when I talk about bunion in this way my purpose isn't to Uh beat up on bunion What what I what what is interest of me is how? The storytelling has changed and you know if if I go if I go out into some places We're near where I live and I look for fault lines and I look for buildings and ground and things like this You know, I'm and then we talk about things like tectonic plates which Order are these words that we use that explain Earthquakes, but what what really is a tectonic plate but sort of a scientific paradigm Is it but our tectonic plates not real? No, they are real. But what exactly is happening when? We have all these paradigms. And so to me part of the interest in say, okay Let's look at these grail stories and let's look at bunion And let's see how storytelling has changed and let's see how this is represented representative of movements in culture movements in christianity movements in the church movements in theology These are data points and you know, and then so when you read tolkien and then especially lewis as we've continued to sort of Continue to try to catch up to lewis in terms of what exactly are you doing? Why why are you doing these things and the longer we seem to be studying lewis the more we begin to say you know, he wasn't just sort of A child playing around with these things. He actually was Doing a lot of things when he was doing this Yeah, lewis is pretty attentive to What is expected of certain archetypes and then is able to Is able to use those in ways that Seem like they might be subversive, but they're actually revealing something more about the original. Um Actually a really key scene to reading Uh the line that was in the wardrobe is the scene with father christmas um That's a really important scene people should go back and reread that and really think about it All right I have one quick thing. I have a funny story about how I actually learned of the existence of pilgrims regress. I was when I was a freshman At the evergreen state college there were two uh Attractive young women who were in the christian I was an agnostic at the time the two attractive young women that they were in that evergreen actually had a christian club at that Time if you can believe it or not there but there was a christian club at the evergreen state college Pretty famous like conservative university, right? Yeah, right, but there was a christian club When I was there at least and actually the person the faculty advisor for the christian club was orthodox by the way um Patricia krapczyk, um in any case they were reading pilgrims regress, which I had not read But I had a reputation for being smart So like during they came up to my table during lunch and was like hey, we're reading this Can you help me understand it? So that's how I first so like they would read out loud to me like what and I would explain it to them It's like okay. That's what's going on here. Ah It's always about beauty. Oh, that's so funny. Yeah All right. Can I start the quest tomorrow? um What day is today? It's friday. Yes. Yeah Friday's a good day to begin a quest. You're already doing it That's the thing You're already doing it Yeah Very protestant answer Richard do you know anything about the island of brazil on medieval irish folklore? Yes, uh, we may So the next universal history will we've had a couple of requests. I have a very fun thing on irish folklore to do Uh, we may also do dragons. So Yeah, people get very excited about the dragon thing. So we might do that next. Um Although that the one where I read a bunch of gaelic poetry is the one I was really excited about but anyway, it's fine I'll talk about dragons, whatever uh, but yes, um So we'll probably do that We'll probably uh hit on that. Um You know the these different there's there's actually a lot of medieval irish folklore that has to do with You know the sort of paradisical island off to the west. This is an idea for which for obvious reasons. Tolkien was quite interested in um, and actually if you want to if you want like a uh, a kind of a Tolkien story people are sleeping on Um, go look up you can find the text online go look up a poem of him. His called the voyage of st brendan so Okay All right. Good question. What is a good grail story for reading to kids? Um I'm a big fan of the boy's own king arthur or if the language in that is a little too hard than uh, the roger lancelot green who is one of the inkling and actually also For my my my orthodox peeps in the crowd Made the as far as I can find the second ever translation of the akathist hymn to the mother of god into english Because he used to vacation the greens and the lewis's vacation together in greece during the summers And um at some point roger lancelot green heard the akathist hymn and translated it It's not the first translation but as far as I I know it's the second And you can find it in the it's like the oxford manual of christianity or something like that. But anyway, um Anyway, but he has a series of books where he retells groups of of mythology um, so he's got one on Uh like myths and legends, so he's got one that's like all the egyptian myths and one that's all of the uh, Uh greek myths and then he also has like a robin hood Collection of like all the famous robin hood stories and then he also has one on uh, the arthurian stuff and you can get it From pangolin. Um, it's a really really good kind of collection of all the major arthurian material in the kind of malory tradition and it's Approachably laid out for young people. Um, And that's where I would start if I was trying to introduce my kids to any of the arthurian stuff. So Thank you Do you all agree with michael ward's thesis in planet narnia? Yes Yeah, it seemed compelling to me there's a surprise saint uh, silouan the athonite appearance at the end of that book as well, so That's pretty neat All right Um, just going through the questions. Oh Um, just remember put question in front so I can find it some of you who've done super chats They automatically get starred because that's how I sort of manage them here. Uh, what's a good grail story for adults? I think we might have different answers on this one I think you seem to be you seem to be partial to kreechon, but I really love wolfram Yeah, speak up. I part for me. It's pars of all wolfram van eschenbach Yeah, I mean that one is I any of the medieval romances if you can get them in a good translation and you can stick with It are great. Um I feel like there's like a lot more Um In some respects, I think kriyant is like more arthurian, which is why I like it better but um, it is it's definitely more arthurian but um Those are all good if you want an interesting If you wanted like a non-medieval grail story, i'm not sure if you're that's what you're asking for. Um Modern retellings of the grail story that have been really good and insightful are like it's a pretty short list um because we get really muddled on some of the stuff, but there's There's a ton of sneaky of good but very sneaky grail stuff in the uh, the lewis's cosmic trilogy Um, so that might be worth kind of looking at. Um Um Uh, oh and tennyson, um, if you if you if you like reading poetry And even if you don't like reading poetry, um tennyson's idols of the king id Y lls, um his I will full-throatedly second that Yeah, and I also say martin shaw martin shaw's book the snowy tower Which is his own retelling of wolfram's is is an excellent book. I haven't read that one because it What martin shaw does is is interesting because he kind of like gives you the original story plus his own poetic Brilliant interpretation of the story at the same time Um and the way he writes his books is very interesting So but he's always dealing with some traditional story, but then he's also interspersing it with his own contemporary observations All right. All right Is the grail more skyrim or more zelda? I I've never played either. I'm an old dude. I only play civilization. That's a heck of a question I don't know. Let me think about that. I think it's more zelda, but I think because at least it's all that Zelda at least there's like the there's more of a real questing elements in Zelda than skyrim. I think Because I don't know like those those those games like skyrim is like, I don't know How much of the questing element is there really? Oh, there's the elder scrolls games have a lot of other ones but skyrim's kind of like to me They all got progressively worse like daggerfall was the best And then they all got worse after that So for me marowind is always going to be peak elder scrolls, but sure I think that's just a generational thing there. Maybe marwan's also good. Yeah Yeah, I don't know, um I think it's probably more zelda, but of course all the new zelda games are open world But it's that's that's not really like if if you want to ask the question Like which world does it is it more likely to belong to it belongs in zelda because link is canonically roman catholic So there you go. Well, there we go There's the answer. All right What do you guys think of the urantia book and movement? I have no idea what that is Never heard of it None of us know we can't we can't think because we don't know Nope, uh question. Do you think harry potter is our contemporary c.s lewis? If not, who is have you heard of the theory that the four horses in harry potter are inspired by the four kids in? The narnia series. Well, there's no doubt that rowing is so just to be clear by lewis So hold on before people for people who don't know harry potter is the name of a character in the story JK rowling is the name of the author. Um, yes, i'm just giving her in a hard time. Um It's harry potter contemporary c.s lewis. Well, no because he's a he's a fictional wizard but um Um Maybe I mean, uh As as much as I love lewis and I named one of my children edmund perseval lewis roland so you can Sort of figure out where I stand on like who's my favorite grail knight? Who's my favorite? You know, like no I it'd be difficult to love lewis more than I do I think that there's sort of a question in my mind of whether or not lewis will be read in 100 years um There's no doubt for me about tolkien um Whether or not some of lewis's stuff is really going to endure beyond like, you know, like a niche consciousness of basically people like us Um, that's kind of an open question. Um Um, I think that And I don't know about rowling stuff, I don't know, um, we have to see if it can weather the um, you know This goes back to what paul was saying earlier. Like I don't know like ask me in 100 years. Um, We have to see if we can weather what's going on right now, you know in the great american divorce I was not expecting the liberals to get nascar and the conservatives to get harry potter, but that's how it was very confusing like the liberals got nascar and budweiser and the conservatives got harry potter and I don't even know what to make of that That's good. That's good. Any thoughts on steven r lawhead's retelling of the arthurian cycle You want to go first mate? I haven't read it. Oh, um I think they're pretty okay um like that Sounds like i'm damning with faint praise or whatever, but I read them I like them I like lawhead in general. I think that he's like When it comes to the sacramental sacramental nature of some of the stuff. He's like really close, but he's not quite there um And I also think that honestly That the books were all twice as long as they needed to be um, which is not to say I don't like long books but um, I I like books that are long because they need to be long not because Anyway, so I I think there's a lot of um, they they don't have like the same precision of some of lawhead's later stuff I think um, and I think that just has to do with him maturing as a writer, but I like them fine I like them fine Okay, I think they're like Probably like the best christian fantasy retelling of the stuff that we've had recently Okay What was good and was what was not so good about tom holland's take on the grail now? I listened to it. Did either any of the rest of you listen to it? I'm I'm okay. I'm sorry. So I again One of the things you have to understand about the rest is history that they are both They are both modern historians and so the questions they bring to the podcast are sort of what are the historical roots of these grail stories and what are What historical movements are they emerging from and tom basically? Locates them with um with knights and the eucharist so um But but again tom is funny because tom on one hand will In in his day job, he'll sort of try to stick between the lines But he's very you know in his heart. He wants to He wants to go through the wardrobe And so tom is just always right on that border which makes him for me Pastorally a really handy guy to point people to because people are sort of they want to play between the lines But boy that wardrobe they've heard rumors and they kind of want to And and so sometimes they move the the coats aside and they just find the back of it. They're like, uh, it wasn't real but every now and then There's a snowy wood beyond the behind beyond the uh wardrobe. So um Here it is Okay, um, let's see I'm looking for any more or almost out of time uh question Any advice on writing stories? Lots Um, I mean You know the the big thing is that you need to uh, is that we learn by imitation so if you want to If you want to learn how to write you should first of all just read a lot I can always tell when a writer or for that matter like a preacher has stopped reading because because they'll just kind of start repeating their material, but um So if you want to be a writer, right you need to first of all read a whole bunch and then take a story that you like and uh Try to write your own version of it just like in short form or whatever But just take a story you like try to do your own retelling of it. Don't worry about the symbolism Don't worry about any of that stuff. Just try to write the story um in your own version, uh, and then you need to do this for one million words And for that first one million words, you are not allowed to get anything published um, and then once you hit that million Then you can go back and look at your work again and you'll have a much better sense of what is good and what is not so It reminds me pjr work once said that if he ever taught writing he would only assign parody Which is kind of similar advice. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, yeah, you can do parody you can do homage But like you start out by We start out by learning by imitation like I learned things Uh, I learned things, you know by watching my dad do them, right? I learned things by watching Tolkien do them. I learned things by watching You know cut yeah and do them right and so That's how you start and then you and then you try to imitate and then eventually And then don't worry if it's original or not originality is a um a lie made up by the elites to keep people from Having fun and then b also like it's it's uh, it's just a modern preoccupation Uh, you think of the middle ages anybody like cared if what they were doing was original No, in fact, they would have sort of seen originality as like kind of inauthentic um So, you know, don't worry about whether or not it's original. Yeah Yeah Originality in some sense still comes through Of course, even when they're telling the same story, of course, but not when you find to worry about it and be clever Yeah originality is about your voice. Yeah, so just like develop by doing what richard don't worry about being stupid by being an original right You'll be stupid anyway, so All right. We got a few more questions and then it's noon already. So we're gonna land the plane I don't know anything about this. I'd say you know, I sent you an article Actually that was about uh Corban's approach to the grail paul Oh, I had never read it from tim nos academy um Yeah, um, I think it's interesting. Um And uh, it's definitely worth reading um, I don't think he gets everything right but his but here's the thing that I want to say about Corban sensibility that the grail is telling us about another reality Is right sure All right Uh, do you think it's reason do you think it's reasonable to think about the grail as a symbol of the kairos? That is the consummation I will require more clarity on that question. I think they're talking about the marriage of heaven and earth in which case it should Yes is the answer All right, that's why there's a connection to the divine feminine Um Would the three of you come to an estuary hub conference in texas? There's a lot of tlc people in the state that requires an estuary hub to be functioning I'm already in texas So and i'm a i'm a light touch. I will travel for I will travel to incur and to encourage estuary growth and development. So let's get together. Let's have some beers Let's have some brisket.

Of course, there's a lot of talk about israel in february Kansas city is really getting serious about doing something. There is a ton of potential in texas Uh richard beck's out there in texas. He's a guy that people should be thinking about, you know I had a great conversation with him. So Um, yeah people if you want to have an event near you organize it figure out how to pull it off That's the whole deal. I'll wear denim I'll wear denim too. I usually wear denim. I think corey is on the is much further south than you are though Oh, I don't care We have cars and planes and things. Um Is the shroud that covers jesus body in the tomb also a sort of holy grail. Yes, it's one of them Uh, we talk about this in the video I did with pego, but yes, yep. Yep. Yep All right. I think that closes our questions Thank you both for um coming on this morning. I thought this was a great conversation Yeah, and I hope I hope the uh, I hope those who watched enjoyed it too And um, I know there's you know, there's hot stuff involved in here, but um Really worthwhile and just thank both of you for the work that you do on youtube and on the internet and in the world in general So thank you much Very good.
