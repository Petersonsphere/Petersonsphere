 Hi, this is Paul. I've been thinking a lot about the image of God and the non-player character meme and I may entitle this video The non the argument from non-player characters for the necessity of God or something like that on the non-player character meme Gosh memes come so fast. The culture is moving so fast I heard about this what a year ago or so and I'm I always feel myself late to the game You know after our Friday morning Sessions on discord or my Sunday service I'm I'm in the AV room with Rick and Rick's always showing me some new thing He found on the internet and it just blows my mind. So, you know, every pastor needs a Rick But the the image of so the non-player character mean basically comes from people playing video games and I know that there's a degree of I Don't know embarrassment on some by that but video games are a I think one of the if the let's say if the If if motion pictures movies television were sort of the vital art form Emergence of the 20th century Well video games could be for the 21st century because it takes it takes the movie art form and brings it to another level now The non-player character mean basically if you play a video game, there are non-player characters and now with massive multi-person video games where like World of Warcraft I I In the second conversation I had with Topher we talked you talked quite a bit about video games That's a that's a two. That's a two-hour plus conversation. So that's coming a little bit later this week I've been putting out to a day lately. I know some of you Am I is my sound on And I gotta I got the I got the open studio over there Okay back back to back to video games. Well in video games when you're playing with well I'm the only the only video game I really play much of is civilization And I'm on Civ 6 right now and I'm not a particularly good player And I play with my son Jared who you can find on the discord and he usually beats me but I still enjoy playing and I Can't play the the first-person shooters with a lot of people because I You know it pong was just coming online when I was young so There we have it. So I can't work those joysticks like like y'all can but anyway So there's all these these non-player characters and their computer generated characters and they they work from AI and they're dumb Okay, maybe they've been getting smarter But they're but they're they're dumb or they're cheats and we have a sense of that and and we have a sense of That and and we have a sense when we're playing against a real person Now increasingly and this gets tied into the meaning crisis. Well, what on earth does that mean? And I've been thinking about basically Theologically it'd be anthropology About what what is a human being and what are we and and we are we are really repeaters and so what propaganda is basically if you if you're working your We're all getting a lesson in civics during this last election if you're if the What am I thinking of if the legitimacy of your government is based on the a popular vote, okay That's a certain system and that stands in contrast and comes in some ways in opposition to divine right which was you know monarchies And you can you can read about that in the in the early modern period where kings were, you know Kings ruled by divine right and of course the Enlightenment comes around and says no It's the consent of the governed and so consent at a very deep level becomes something vital now I did a conversation with burn that I just released my friend burn power and and if you haven't watched that conversation And if you don't his as someone noted his channel is ridiculously undersubbed burn is this source of Just a voluminous information about Culture in the late 20th century I mean he's a music nerd and an art nerd and a puppetry nerd of all things puppetry and So, you know, he's also big into Jacques Elul and propaganda and so basically propaganda is a way to Colonize the masses and and it assumes that to one degree or another the masses are a non-player character And of course if you've been following along We've we've been trying to get a sense of what we mean by this word spirit or spiritual and and so the the non-player That the non-player characters are sort of the fodder of spirit. It's it's what gets Propagandized it's it's that which can be easily colonized and and this of course becomes a meme because when we see someone who has been colonized or pwned or or owned by by some political agenda or some ideology or they always come up with the same answers and This has been a complaint against Christians while they've been indoctrinated That word has become a negative thing and and all of this Conversation behind this just reveals an anxiety about freedom and An anxiety and of course the the key word today is authenticity and of course Charles Taylor writes about this and we all want to be authentic that we want to We want to somehow be connected to some real thing and this leads to the the secret sacred self Which is imagined to be down within us that the true me is, you know I joke sometimes the true me is Shirley Temple. I'm not a I'm not a bald 57 year old Dutch Calvinist. I'm I'm a I'm a six year old in a in In a in a cute little skirt tap dancing on an airplane singing the good ship lollipop. It is an airplane. It's not a boat and That's who I am on the inside. That's my true self. That's my real self. And of course this gets This gets poured into all sorts of things like gender identity and sexuality And these are the these are the things kind of running under our politics and our our zeitgeist right now and so People who are maybe a little bit smarter or a little bit more aware of the latest internet meme or a little bit better Briefed on the zeitgeist, you know, it's one easy way to dismiss people is that they're they're non-player characters They've just been programmed by the ideology or the culture. They've been programmed by something and they're just running through their program They're unoriginal. They're boring. We don't like them. We're looking for fresh ideas new things in the attention Economy of YouTube we're looking for something which will capture our interest something which will dazzle us I think about some of the songs in Mulan Rouge a movie that I I very much enjoyed. I really like Mulan Rouge a lot I should probably listen to its soundtrack again. I Yeah, I find that movie quite compelling But maybe I'm an NPC for that and and so there's this hierarchy that developed who is the freshest and you know Kanye West and and some of the other as Jonathan Peugeot calls them clowns that part of the reason they grab our attention is because you know Who can make up Alex Jones and when Alex Jones starts sounding sane either we're in trouble or he's lost his edge And so we're looking for that and so to be a to be a non-player character is is to be dismissed Is to be someone who is unimportant. It's to be someone who sort of recedes into the background These are the these are the fodder that we shoot up easily in our in our first-person shooters either that or they're the cheats because they've been programmed by the computer and so when I play civilization as you go up into the Difficulty levels because I'm smarter than the computer the computer just cheats it gives itself more cities It gives itself more resources all these ways to try to compete with me and I'm using my relevance realization to try to out compete the computer but when I play a computer game against a real person well now I've got a I've got I've got a challenge because someone else has been Colonizing and reading the background and figuring out and directing it and again I find it hard to imagine that we're really gonna get behind tell off beyond tell us because behind beyond goals and because when I'm playing civilization with my son Jared he loves to beat me and Now we kind of know each other and and so if I have an island map and if I'm on a different continent I usually invest more in Navy and Air Force and so He can't get to me, but he invests in in in leveling up his land troops And so if I'm in a land mass with him I know I'm in trouble because he tends to emphasize the land warfare and I tend to emphasize the Air Force and the Navy and So he can't get to me and that really frustrates him And so then he learns the certain wonders that I get to ramp up my Navy and he tries to get those Wonders before me and back and forth Jared and I go trying to play civilization trying to beat each other and of course, it's it's great fun because Here's the thing as a son it's always fun to beat your father But not too much because he's your father and as a father It's not as much fun to beat your son but you want to put up a good fight and and there's always something proud in you when your son beats you because you have a sense of of You know, I've brought you into the world and I want you to be better than I can be so that's sort of how Progress and progression moves into that so so the non-player meme is around there better read my slide Otherwise, I'll forget it You know down for the repeater of popular ideas someone who is lacking agency Someone who is a dupe or a shill for a bigger name or a larger spirit Now I've also been talking a lot about first our first draft nature how when you first get married, let's say or you first begin a Significant relationship with someone let's say you're living together or something like that You bump into all of these ways that that you are simply formed by your parents You have all of these built-in behaviors and notions and expectations that That you don't realize you have They just are a product of your upbringing and and so in that sense There's a certain the first draft that you have within you is also sort of a non-player character It's not thinking it's not conscious. It's not intentional It's just the world is such you have a map of the world and you're working from it and then if you start living especially if you're living with someone of The opposite sex and you have an intimate relationship with them and there's a there's a very interesting conversation with Guy Sangstock and and Christopher Mastro Pietro and John Ververt John Verbecky and Jordan Green or Jordan Hall Green Hall no Hall Jordan Hall on the self, which is a really wonderful conversation and Probably is one I should listen to again because they they really went into some very interesting places with respect to the self but anyway so we're all these non-player characters inside we sort of sense that and and and this is where we're sort of Multiple inside and we have our consciousness Congress and we're we're trying to we're trying to improve ourselves And so we have this sense that the to the degree that I can this is part of the reason you go into therapy To the degree that I can sort of transcend the non-player character that is within me the degree that I have some agency that I have some insight that I have some realization about how I've been formed and how I'm put together and And what it is to be me so that now in the context of this intimate relationship or this marriage or this business or this church or this Community I can sort of level up and I can have more agency and I can act with more Consciousness and I can do all of these things so so we're absorbers We are we are the most capable compression algorithm imaginable that was kind of the I do videos and And usually part of the reason I do videos is sometimes in the process of the video. I will say something And I will I use the video to harvest what I say and I use my audience to find out if I've said something of Some substance because if I do sometimes it's just funny sometimes it's creative But it gets echoed back to me just this morning when I I logged into the open studio on the discord server I I mentioned that I was reading Church Fathers and and and someone said a team or B team because I've made the comment about Maximus the confessor as a B team Church Father and and and part of the joy of and and really the usefulness of the discord server for me Has been a community where they're you know, they can't keep up with my videos. I've been doing two a day lately My sister just my sister just is getting healthy from surgery And if you think I can put out content you should see my sister. She just puts out content about different things But you know, we come from the same we come from the same line and and that creativity That's that I can sort of find back in my ancestors my my grandmother and my grandfather and the Vanderkley side and I'm gonna mention the song from Sarah Groves. You are the son. I can't listen to that son and not that song and not tear up and And then then I'm sort of like my grandfather on my mother's side my mother's father because By the end of his life he can couldn't get through family devotions without tearing up and he would make these cassette videos for his For He would make cassette videos and he'd play music on them and he'd read scripture on them He'd break you'd have to stop the video because he was crying. Well, why is he crying? What's because it's moving him deeply? Well, why is it moving him deeply? well stuff had been imprinted from him early on and and and so you get the sense of a life as a as a as a As a sacrifice as a As something we give back to God because it's all of this stuff that has been poured in but but but we are so we are Repeaters but we are these strange kinds of repeaters that are also agents And so we get to decide what our eyes see and what our ears see and what we're reading and what we're putting into us Because what we put into us is what will come out of us But of course reshaped and reformed so that the the relationship I have with my wife is different from the relationship My father had with my mother and it is different from that's different from the relationship that my Grandparents had with each other and on and on and on and and so we are we are repeaters But we're special kinds of repeaters now the Sarah Grove song She she takes this This ancient Christian image of God being the Sun and we are the moon Because we understand that the moon has no light of its own the moon does not shine like the Sun the Sun Shines the moon reflects and this this song by Sarah Groves is is just beautiful And and to me it it touches me deeply and that's why I say I can't I can't well See if I how much I tear up just looking at the words of it You are the Sun shining down on everyone light of the world giving light to everything I see sort of the CS Lewis I see by the Sun not just I don't just see the Sun It's the light of the Sun that helps me see everything else Beauty so brilliant. I can hardly take it in I can't look at the Sun and Everywhere you are is warmth and light and I am the moon with no light of my own Still you have made me to shine and so the the first draft that I received from my parents and my grandparents and my my Dutch Calvinist tradition and and the the genetics in my blood and the Genetics in my body and all of this comes together Like that's why I say we're the most amazing compression algorithm ever Imaginable because not only do we take all this stuff and not only our repeaters Well, what does God call you are the image of God? Well, what does that mean? Well, that means that if you think of God number one, so let's focus on God number one now that the arena the the the the God who is imminent the God of whom That the whole earth declares your glory We are the image of That God now we're gonna get into God number two and how we're image of that God too Because the image of God number one is that we are first drafts We are repeaters. We are non-player characters and we absorb and we absorb and this this picture here This picture here that little that little toddler. That's my youngest son Ben and You know, it's amazing because if you have enough kids Well, they don't really repeat but so my wife my wife was adopted and eventually reunited with her birth mother and she has a full-blooded brother and sister and And that whole process was interesting because she was raised by people very different from the the family that gave her up her her birth mother and her birth father eventually married her her birth mother became pregnant as a teenager at 15 and But but kept a relationship with with her birth father and then when they got a little older they married and had two more children and they themselves divorced but the birth mother was quite a bit more interested in in reuniting with my wife and But the birth father was not as interested and but she got to meet him and then when he passed a number of years ago We got to see pictures of him in his youth and If he doesn't look a lot like my oldest son and my youngest son now Jared my second son who you'll find in the community Sometimes he looks a lot more like me Jared's my height and he looks sort of like me and like my father and sometimes I look at pictures of my son Jared and pictures of my father when he was young and same color hair same body build You know and it's just interesting how these genetics come through and so we're these we're these copies but we're also these absorbers of were these absorbers of patterns of of you know My my children all have the rough draft of of my marriage to my wife for better or for worse They have the rough draft of me as a father for better or for worse for me as a man for better or for worse and and all of that is in them and they won't discover that until they get into a certain situation and they find this rough draft Manifesting themselves and part of the reason we can't really define this nature nurture line is because it's all of a thing it's all coming together and And so I am the moon I am I am all of these rough drafts and and just waiting for the light of the Sun to To shine on me with no light of my own still you make me to shine in other words This now we're getting into God number two this the agent in the arena the conscious actor the chooser the The one that that that says well, here's the rough draft of my parents relationships This is how I am going try to try to improve it and then maybe you know You try something out and you hope it's an improvement So you try it out and you really realize it's not an improvement It was a step back as you try something different and of course But you know, my wife is not my mother and I am not my father and so to to put us together And then of course, we're gonna have children and and it just goes on and on and on and on And as I glow in this cold dark night, I know I can't be a light unless I turn my face To you you are the Sun shining down on everyone light of the world giving light to everything I see Beauty so brilliant. I can hardly take it in and everywhere you are is warmth and light Shine on me with your light without you. I'm a cold dark stone shine on me. I have no light of my own You are the Sun You are the Sun and I am the moon and the song is you know meet me me reading the lyrics is nothing like the the music itself and and it is it's um, and The title of her album which I didn't notice until just right now Add to the beauty and and that's what we do. So we take these first drafts and then which are sort of God number one within us and then the god number two given to us The this conscious agent we take this first draft and we we try to improve it And and so we try to we try to grow beyond being non-player characters And again, this is this is built into the national built into the mean built into the conversation that somehow we want to transcend From being non-player characters. This is built into the the Matrix movie, of course because agent Smith What do what do the agents do you see them there's somebody just driving a garbage truck, right and then the Agent comes into it and now we know the agents coming into it in the movie because they morph into One of the agents and now we can recognize them before they were actually more unique, but they were a non-player character They were just a police officer or just a garbage man or just something else But now they're an agent and in many ways who want to go from being these non-player characters Into agents we want agency. We want to become a real boy in Pinocchio So I've been reading Church Fathers and I decide well, I'm gonna start at the beginning. So I started with Clement of Alexandria or a Clement of Clement of Rome very early Church Father you know something that I've dealt that dabbled into before because if you're If you're doing any work in New Testament epistles in Greek Sometimes you know, you're you found a hap lax legomano, which is a word That's only found once in the New Testament So you want to find some other examples of it to see what the word means what you know again and what you're doing What sort of this historical grammatical exegesis you're trying to mind read the Apostle Paul And of course, that's a that's a really fraught thing, but you're trying to get back into it. So I Have copies of quite a bit of material from Church Fathers in my logos Bible software But I don't have all of it in Greek and So I'm reading along in letter to die odd Diognitous I'm gonna have to figure out how to say that and They're talking about the Jews. And of course, I've been talking to some people about anti-semitism lately and not on the channel but offline and As anti-semitism has always sort of mystified me I mean, what's with the what's with the what's with the annoyance and in fact the the hatred of the Jews? What's with that? I think part of it is because you remember in my last video I talked about you can sort of think think of civilization as this huge genocidal story now again, that's a that's a Disparaging way of putting it but there's a there's a there's a devouring aspect to imperialism into Civilization that once once you get connected into the net, let's imagine you're a this is what happened with the Colombian You know when Columbus basically globalization 1493 Charles Mann's excellent book globalization the Colombian exchange globalization begins when Columbus basically Ties the Americas into the network now. I'm a I'm a huge fan of Oak Island Just the biggest tease on TV. Are they ever gonna find anything? Is there anything under there? but a curse of Oak Island, but And so you see that you know Europeans had come to the Americas for a while and we know that about the Vikings and some of these things but But what happens in the Colombian exchange is that the network that the network which who's sort of its epicenter is in Europe At that point begins to reach out and connect the world and so you have you have silver from South America Flowing into China and China is at that point very much the superpower and the reason the Europeans wanted to get to China is Because China has all the best Technology and all the best commercial goods and if you can get stuff from China It's so much better made than Europe and again this whole I can't think about this value now and Sevilla has sufficiently colonized me a quality experience that That you know, I've got I've got perseg in my mind and again This is this is this is what happens to us ideas have power and they colonize us and and and how do we know? When an idea is better or worse than another we don't really know but we have a sense about it an intuitive sense about it And so sort of captures our interest and again you think about Think about McGill Christian the master and the emissary the master is the intuitive mind and the emissary is the accountant that that Gets all the reason right and gets it all out there. But the the master is calling the shots so How did I get on to perseg and value? Well, well imperialism civilization is one grand avarice avaricious eater of Microcivilizations that have not developed and can't compete with the dominant one. And so there's a there's sort of an implicit certainly not a not a infallible meritocracy that happens in Civilizations where where they just consume one another and this has been happening for a long time and now there's just these little pockets of You know, maybe aboriginal dwellers and deep rain forests and we're revisiting Star Trek episodes when well Should we allow ourselves to be known? We don't want to be paternalistic Well with holding yourself and your culture from someone who doesn't know it know it because you have some ideas about You know protecting them there's a deep paternalism built into that thing too, so How on earth did I get here from the Church Fathers anyway, so oh Antisemitism I got to kind of retrace my steps. Okay back to antisemitism. And so I'm reading in this church fire now The the okay why why the hatred of the Jews Well in some ways this peculiar people And you can find this this pattern in the Bible This this peculiar people was resistant to empire it was resistant to the dominant culture and in fact the The gospels and the stories of jesus are right there at the epicenter of that because That's what they're dealing with to what degree will we allow athens to colonize? Jerusalem that's in a sense the the the culture war at the heart of the conflict between between Herod and the Pharisees let's say and Jesus comes right into the middle of that conflict and and Steps in in such a fresh way that both the dominant civilization of the Romans and the resistant civilization of the Jews Comes into conflict and I mean this might sound a little hegelian Jesus sort of transcends that conflict but but what's so peculiar about history is that and Frankly, I think this is the providence of God. The Apostle Paul has colonized me sufficiently Why that why do the Jews keep hanging around? Somehow non-converted yet always sort of in the midst of this culture You know you couldn't make an argument that you know that the grand jewish conspiracy if if they didn't win so many nobel prizes and weren't so influential in hollywood or new york city and and and what's with the capacity of the Jews to be able to do this and and and even just saying the Jews makes it a question of What exactly are we talking about are we talking about them genetically because again, they're they're sort of an ancient Holdout in that they're both they're both a People whose religion and their ethnicity go together now I was listening to shane allen and jacob from the discord server had a little Conversation that was linked on the discord server and I was listening to that Quite a bit last night and and I want to do another conversation About this because You know there again there's we we've had in this in these later days At the end of world war two islam seemed to almost disappear and of course no one would look at that and say well They disappeared today. They came roaring back Excuse me in the 20th century There's there's sort of a renaissance of ultra orthodox judaism. What's with that? What's with what's with the you know the strange Death of europe douglas murray's Title of you know of the islamic growth in in europe what's going on with us? Anyway, so there's a lot going on here that is right before our very eyes that we can't see and don't know and want to gain Perspective on but it's very hard. So i've been reading church fathers and because you know over the last couple of years I've been doing more reading of tom holland and reading of history and tom holland basically prompted me to read more history And try to get better versed on I guess lots of history And so you read enough secondary sources at some point you want to read primary sources and you've got enough Orientation to to sort of get a sense of what on earth is going on in that ancient world And so i'm reading the epistle to Diognitus the more I try to say it the more i'll probably reinforce an incorrect Pronunciation of it and so i'm reading along in english and i'm in the chapter four Of course, these chapters are really tiny in these books. You'll learn that if you read enough of them But as to their scrupulosity be concerning meats and their superstition as respect to the sabbath So now so here are the jews. They're sort of this resistance They're not on the fringe like aboriginals in the jungle. They're right there in the middle of it It's basically in the middle of the world that the nexus between Europe and asia and africa and there are these people that somehow don't assimilate And and and so something deep inside of us the agents within the matrix Want to come and attack them why because they're not a seminal assimilating we need them to assimilate to the non-player character the dominant culture and You know the borg resistance is futile And Well, the jews seem to say it isn't and but but of course all of their Stuff is is interesting and and now to where i got from here There's a real conflict between the christians and the jews in in the first few centuries now now Conflict between and if you keep reading this epistle to diogen Diagnetus you'll notice it's conflicts between the greeks and the christians because the christians sort of take on this this this jewish quality of being apart and Sort of when they reach preeminence in europe. Well, then they kind of In my opinion defy their savior by becoming tyrants because jesus was many things but he was not a tyrant And and so and so you see jesus but here's here's the thing Jesus is not only a jew he's in a sense the quintessential jew. Why is that? He's he's so much so that The the first draft of him which let's call the old testament he many of those on that draft turn against him and and the christians will will sort of perform this trick again and again and again and So they're in conflict with the jews. They're in conflict with the jews The greeks is just the broader hellenistic culture And but then I bump into this word But as to their scrupulosity concerning meets in their superstition as respect to sabbath now, wait a minute a whole bunch of part of things about reading church fathers in translation is This gets into a lot of the reading about the reformations and the renaissance and classics, etc. Etc, etc A lot of these you can find these translations out on the internet gosh it I feel like i'm rehearsing the renaissance in my body Okay, maybe that's what we've been doing for the last three years so I'm reading through this in english and I know full well many of these public domain translations of the church fathers are are from the late 19th beginning early 20th century And and so their translations betray The culture of that point. So again, i've been trained in the grammatical historical interpretation Which has its roots back into the renaissance periods and and erasmus and luther and this whole story that i've been trying to tell And so I read that word Superstition and of course that has a despairing valence and so now because of my sensitivity to antisemitism Okay, well and I don't think it's a I don't I I don't think it Unfairly reads the mind of this helenistic Christian this church father who is in real life in conflict with real jews probably But so then well, what's the greek word under it But so then well, what's the greek word under it Desi demonia and my bible software says, you know, the english translation of that is religion Oh now i'm deep into tom holland land What is superstition what is religion Why would the why would the the dietary laws and the sabbaths and the circumcision and the fasting and the new moons be Pejoratively labeled as superstition by a second century christian. Okay, because the the conflict is hot back there And then why would it be related to this word that we would have for demons? Where where where's demons in that religious word well well diamonds not not diamonds Diamonds the the the or daemon let's say because because what we do in english now because when we say demon We're so deep into christendom that when we think demon Well, if you go to a panacostal church, they'll tell you exactly what a demon is Okay, but is that what they thought in the ancient world because they were seriously concerned about demons But what did they mean by demons and and and so now barfield is ringing in my head and and C. S. Lewis and I really want to do a video on how you really can't just simply go back through the thread and we When we read demon this word in a second or third century text It simply means what you'll find in a panacostal church or or in martin luther's Well, what is it? Well, it's a spirit and so, you know the Socrates is the the the diamond the daemon that you know, the demon is talking to him and he listens to his demon Well, we're not we're not thinking about demon in that sense. What are we thinking about? We're thinking about a spirit Well, what is a spirit? Well school spirit someone recently was talking about their you know, the high school or college They went to a church and they went to a church and they went to a church You know the high school or college they went to I said school spirit because it formed you but but but what is school spirit? And so what is a daemon a daemon is is almost in some ways analogous to nature Why were daemons found in nature? Why were for example the Navajo so worried about demons? Well, these are natural processes They have outcomes, but they're brother, but they're also agentic. All right so So what how does that connect up with religion and superstitions? Well, well, what are you doing with respect to your Sabbaths and your circumcision and your dietary laws and your? Practices that's our new word now our practices and of course if you say practices that's that's so I'm not religious I have practices and of course that's that's where they vervekey is so good and so honest because he's kind of you know Know that the old world word is religion and new word is practices that were well, what are we doing? Why are we using new words? Why are we trying to evolve beyond non-player character status to become a real boy or a real girl? And you know, why do we have to save our father from the belly of the whale and you know? We're in the midst of all of us in this stuff Their spirits behind the non-player characters, it's their coding it's the Ideology and that's that's what we don't you're just you know Someone comes along and and calls you a racist and it's like, okay You're an NPC because everybody's everything's a racist now Everybody's a racist and everybody's a sexist and so now and now you're just trotting out D'Angelo or Kennedy see how fast the culture is going. There's just a few years old and now already we're Oh that's so that's so 2018 You haven't had 2020 yet. Well, what is 2020 2020 is is is Trump and the election and look at my Conversation with Byrne when he goes through this whole list of things that would have been huge news But if completely overwhelmed by what we've been through Now this is the the non-player characters the NPCs are of course in contrast to the RGPs the real game players or were those they're real They're human beings they can do relevance realization there If if the NPCs are reflections of God number one or at least analogous to to that side of the ledger Then then the RGPs they're God number two They're the ones who are watching me watching you and they can Mind-read and they have a sense of who you are and they can anticipate who you are Mind-read and they have a sense of who you are and they can anticipate what you're going to do and they're conscious so they can bring in all this information and they can use reason and they can They have all of these gifts and they have intuitions and and when Jared plays I know what dad's going to do next and And because you know, i'll plant a city right by his kingdom or over on his continent and jerry'll get all prankly And I know what he's going to do next. He's going to try and get me off his continent and you know it's spy versus spy it's back and forth and The NPCs once you basically Own or pwn the NPCs you can you can get them every time because they always do the same thing They always say the same thing. They have no relevance. They have no that there's no creativity There's no genuine article There's no that thing at the bottom of the random number generation later that makes sure that it's a real good random number and not just One that some some hacker can easily duplicate or suss out I mean, it's it's it's why again random number generators are so difficult And so they need something that's sort of alive sort of separate so that they can have a better random number than the other Random number you say well if it's random, it's random, but ah random. We're trying to get at the genuine article We're trying to get at authenticity. We're trying to get at the source We're trying to get at the thing itself because we have a sense that the deeper we go down the less non-player character We're trying to get at the at the spirit at the center of the universe we're trying to get at what is what is What has programmed the demons or the diamonds or the spirits? Where I say this wrong all the time I might as well just use it we're barking at the door of the meaning crisis This should be knocking at the door or barking at I put them together. We're barking at the door It makes no sense at all, but it's mine now. It's my it's my little agentic offering to the world We're barking at the door of the meaning crisis because the meaning crisis basically says what if i'm a non-player character What if i'm just simply the product of all the god number oneness that's been built into the world What if there's no god number two in me at all? Because what happens is now with the internet used to be that if you're in a village of A couple hundred people and you're smart. You're probably the smartest person in the village and maybe you play the piano good Well, you're the best pianist in the in the in the village now via the internet We're in one global village and there's always someone who's smarter someone who's better read and it doesn't even have to be Maybe better read in general, but you're talking about this one thing and someone out there knows this one thing And that's what it's like to be a youtube creator because you know you make your little video and like me. It's a mess It's sloppy. It's half thought out. I misspeak that the sound is never quite good and the picture is you know The whole thing's a mess and then you read the comments and you're just you know Exposed to be what a mess you are and the things you got wrong and someone out there Has read barfield better than you have or lewis better than you have or socrates or play-doh better than you have or knows Verveky or you're you're talking to someone who's a scholar and they spend all their time in books and but the thing is i'm i've got books and i've got people but people they're experts in people and they're experts in books and they're experts in all the different disciplines and one human being can't compete with that and and so our algorithm is trying to compress all of this stuff and and and and exist and exhibit some Creativity some god number two-ness something of the genuine article out into the world so that So that we can shine too and not just be a cold dark rock in space A non-player character notice their gray We want to be a real game person a real game player So before I was reading Diognitus I was reading clement of rome and i've read him before in his letter to the corinthians And again there's one copy of it that was attached to a book and that's all we have and You know i've read it before but now of course i've been digging deeper into history and so suddenly when i'm reading clement now as opposed to the half-tub of a dozen times i've read him before suddenly it's fresher because that That image I have in my mind of that time and that space and however Low resolution and untrue it might be I just have a little bit more information now. He was a very early christian leader likely knew paul of tarsus the apostle paul personally And he writes a letter to the church in corinth and i'm reading through it and and it's sort of If you read church fathers and again i've got all these commentaries and if you read church fathers Sometimes well anytime we read a text I can we're a pattern looking at a pattern where a reader reading a text And and as you're reading reading isn't just absorbing it's because we've got now all these developed filters And we filter these things in and and so there's a valence. Do we like them or do we don't like them? There's a tribal valence are they in our tribe or they not in our tribe and so we're reading through all of these things And so so much of this ancient stuff can seem so moralistic But now there's lots of other filters that have been developed in me, huh? And and it's sort of we sort of see it as karma And so we imagine this this big it's so funny because if you see it as karma people are like, oh, Tell me more if you say it as legalism, ah churches and their laws and their dogmas but karma. Oh, tell me more Karma isn't much different from legalism Do right get blessed do wrong be cursed right and and there's a layer of truth in that You know eat like crap have terrible health eat. Well have better health. Yeah, but you might get hit by a car Well, that's just it. I mean the world is too complex and so You can read these texts and oh, okay But now digging digging into these Demons These these these little subroutines these little programs these little patterns these little non-player characters and and you begin to Suddenly the church fathers sort of start coming alive because well Well, what are they talking about? Because well again, you've got the peculiarity you read the gospels a very clearly situated in judia in that in that Colonization Resistant group of people called the jews and jesus who can't seem to be colonized either by his his jewish The jewish people who want to sort of bring back the old testament and the rome and the other jews who are the roman Sympathizers who say no the better way is rome save your early adopters and your your liberals and your conservatives on and on and on and on Obey god and be rewarded. Well, yes and yes Disobey god and be punished. Yes, and yes god number one and god number two But in a sense they're also looking at the romans and they're they're also Maintaining their own tradition. And so these these christians have have jewishness in them and they Jerusalem and Athens are coming together and and being synthesized and and and and and a new thing is coming out of them and There's a there's a critique of of basically common dissolution. Well what dissolution? What do you mean by that? Common vice You know, I'm hungry food is a drive it's a little demon inside of me that says feed me I I have a sex drive who that colonizes me. I have a drive for status That colonizes me all of these drives in me and epithumias the Apostle Paul talks about them they get they get manifest in different ways and talked about in different ways and Now again it this gets back into CS Lewis's miracles his great chapter of horrid red things where you think well Well Paul's just Paul's just disenchanting the world and he's reducing He's reducing the the drives and desires in him to biochemical It's like yeah, but the biochemical is itself a reflection of something. Oh Now we're knocking out the materialist Non-materialist spiritist Because that's its matter and spirit, right and you begin to recognize that well these desires in me are not disconnected to things all they're connected to my biology, but they're also connected to the culture net to this this Material relational pattern that is actually the thing that creates stuff Where's my cell phone stand? You know, you don't you don't have a cell phone stand until you have cell phones and and you take all of this this metal from the ground gets colonized and and made into this stand and So so witches spirit or matter. Oh that hurts Well But my hand moved by spirit. I've been you know, looking into Descartes too recently and so How does this stuff work? Lives driven Chasing the highs of sex of drunkenness the joys of poney, you know and Was was was Nero gay when he would rape a Roman senator in the street Or was it poney does this is sex the primary drive Oh sigmond or Can sex be used as other drives? No, no. No rape is rape is not about sex rape is about violence. No, it's It's about a lot of stuff And it all sort of comes together and us are our non-player Characterness that are running around and and and we're looking for status by using certain words and we're looking for sex by doing certain things and we're we're looking for escape and I can't wait to play the the second conversation I had with Second conversation I had with Topher the salty That's a like I said, that's a two-hour one, but but we get into some of these things Now many philosophers are working on this because in a sense Okay, they're chasing after status. They're chasing after sex They're they're trying to dull the overall complexity of the world by by living on booze or or you can use philosophy this way or or Opium or whatever there there it's it's all of these demons and then we use that language metaphorically To to the drunk in the street they can't they can't escape their demons or the the overbearing mother Who's who's who expresses her insecurity by by being controlling or? By being anxious and and so you know, they're they're demons we say and and now we've sort of Demythologized it and and sort of domesticated it by well, well, that's alcohol is his demon Well, we're saying more than we then we know we're saying because in the ancient world, they'd say yeah, it is his demon But what makes you so sure it's it's not disconnected. Well, yeah. Well alcohol is is a common demon. Well, why well because of biochemical yeah but what makes you so sure that there's not a an Immaterial manifestation of that going on Well again now if you think about Cartesian substances, well, it doesn't really help you But if you're not thinking in terms of Cartesian substances as your primary frame Hmm and so now the Pentecostals Trying to exercise the spirit of drunkenness don't seem quite so crazy. Do they? But they couldn't have done all the philosophy or maybe wouldn't do they could do of course Where they are weren't they doing all this philosophy don't forget James K. Smith was a Pentecostal before he became Christian Reformed They're not dumb What's going on we don't know We just gained status and certain are in certain sense parts of the culture by by decrying By decrying enchantment Well, we're enchanted by disenchantment We don't escape this stuff and so many philosophers were working on this you look at the stoics and and you look at you know What are they trying to do? They're trying to get a handle on their non-player character essence and they're trying to get at something real something foundational Something that will be ever fresh. It will be a spring of living water John 4 It'll be a spring of willing water whole Welling up into eternal life and the woman at the well who certainly has man problems Do you know why don't you take me back to introduce me to your hubby? Well, I don't have a husband yeah, that's right because you've had you know, you've had a few and the one you're with isn't your husband now Well, what's going on? I Want that spring of living water because and now this is when you listen to Jonathan Peugeot talk to talk to Rationality rules Peugeot is right. It scales when she says I want the wall I want your spring of living water so I don't have to keep coming back to the well Jesus doesn't say oh you're dim. You're not a philosopher Jesus understands that that going to the well works on lots of different levels Which is why Peugeot's whole channel works because it does work at lots of different levels and when we get to see it we begin to Like oh, well, what's going on in the world? and we have a sense then of reciprocal narrowing and Reciprocal broadening and when we begin to read Jesus we get into say Well, this guy's really broad This guy's really powerful and when he speaks nature listens. Oh, but now I just crossed another line didn't I? What does it mean to be saved? It means all of this and more it means to no longer be a non-player character It means to be in touch with the source the fount of all Creativity and life and freshness that doesn't get old Because if you live long enough You know, I tell the story about one homeless guy who sat in this office and put a can of beer right on this table And says my life's in that can Being drunk gets old, but I can't live without being drunk another homeless guy I Can't wake up sober think about that think about how steady you're the drip needs to be And now beer is good because too much alcohol and become self-destructive You got to find just the right level or you know, maybe for some of us caffeine Just keep us right there at this edge because I dare not wake up sober It's sobriety that we want it's it's it's to be it's to be plugged into the living source That is always fresh and always new and and not an NPC at all. It's the heart of the real That's what it means to be saved Now there are two directions in this of course CS Lewis writing a story about An uncle demon schooling a nephew demon and how to get a man To us a human is primary food Primarily food our aim is the absorption of its will into ours to make all of the people in our life into non-player characters among us The increase of our own area of selfhood at its expense to make them all into non-player characters I want a Stepford wife I mean, this is this is just you know, I mud the old Star Trek episode This is just littered throughout our culture and and and when people come to me as a pastor and they're frustrated And they're complaining about their spouse or their parent or their child or someone it's because I can't turn them into a non-player character Oh, do you really want to well part of me wants to yeah, I understand that But once I do they will now be boring to me and I'm going to go out and look for another Oh, won't you we call that adultery? To us the demons the things that run on themselves the non-player characters beneath the world a Human is primarily food Our aim is the absorption of its will into ours the increase of our own area of selfhood at its expense but the obedience which the enemy demands of men that's God Chris, you know, this is CS Lewis writing. It's reversed, of course The enemy demands of men is quite a different thing One must face the fact that all the talk about his love. Well, what is love? Love is I don't want my children to be non-player characters of me. I Want them hooked into the source of all life and beauty? I want their face to turn to the Sun so that they shine and all the little beings down in Whoville Look up at the sky at the full moon and say wow, give me those binoculars. It's beautiful The pockmark craters the gray well pocking gray How could that be beautiful but it is it's because the light is the light of the Sun is shining on it One must face the fact that all the talk of his love for men and his service being perfect freedom is Not as one would gladly believe mere propaganda Because propaganda of course is turning everybody into a non-player character So that they can all go to the poll and vote for one or the other That's the goal right turn them all into little non-player characters And no, that's not what our father in heaven the enemy above wants for them. He wants them to be free Well, that's running a terrible risk Yeah, it is But what if in fact? The source of life at the center of the universe is both perfect freedom and Perfect everything else not Devolving into all of the kind of chaos we see when human beings have freedoms Or actually when they have all this freedom Don't they then start getting colonized by the demons and all of the non-agentic? reciprocal narrowing ways that human beings do He really does want to fill the universe with a lot of loathsome little replicas of himself Creatures whose life on its miniature scale will be qualitatively like his own not because he has absorbed them But because their wills freely conform to his we want cattle who can finally become food He wants servants who can finally become sons We want to suck in He wants to give out we are empty and would be filled. He is full and over and flows over Our war aim is a world in which our father below has drawn all beings into himself The enemy wants a world full of beings united to him But still distinct not absorbed not non-player characters a world full of real Real gaming persons But but but that but but again you begin to see well, wait a minute I thought we were NPCs Yeah, we are deep down inside but we're NPCs who have to sort of take on The way of the creator to become create him creative like him to become sub creators The author of all wishes to give characters is the creator of the world The creator of all wishes to give characters in his story agencies. He wants them to grow up and become authors, too Like pinocchio to become real To be free freedom from and freedom, too That now to do this we have to be in alignment with the source of all reality and agency and freedom Read this chapter five Of the letter to diognitous For the christians are distinguished from other men neither by country nor language nor customs which they observe So this is a new thing now in the midst of this imperial mass a new distinctive element comes forward and why are they distinctive they're not just chasing status or chasing Their jollies by sex or food or amusements or this or money or fame They're not just doing that they're doing something different and it's not because of their country They're not just they're they seem We have they're sort of like agent smith popping out But but they don't destroy The the garbage man that was driving the truck suddenly the garbage man becomes more of a garbage man He becomes he becomes the right kinds of garbage man that can oh mrs Smith your garbage can isn't out. Can I go bring it to the street and empty it for you? Oh, I don't think you meant to throw this away. Oh, this should be recycled actually becomes a real agent who can live Productively in the world who can make even garbage collecting God-like Nor they neither inhabit cities of their own nor employ a peculiar speech of their own nor lead a life Which is marked by any singularity the relevance realization is sort of hard to capture The course of conduct which they follow has not been devised by any Speculation or deliberation by inquisitive men. They're not merely the product of philosophers Nor do they like some proclaim themselves to be the advocates of a merely human doctrine they say Our connection is with the divine. Well, lots of people say that see and well Christianity is going to have to endure the the cynicism and the And the npc nature of many of its christians But inhabiting greeks as well as barbarian cities According as as the lot of each of them has determined and following the customs of natives in respect to clothing food And the rest of their ordinary conduct we see secularity already beginning here They display to us their wonderful And confessedly striking or peculiar methods of life They dwell in their own countries, but simply as sojourners As citizens they share in all the things with others and yet endure all things as if foreigners Every foreign land to them is their native country and every land of their birth is a land of strangers They marry as do all others they beget children now, you know, look at my conversation with tim with two m's He's married young at all. You must be a christian you married young We don't marry young we just live with our girlfriends until we get into like our 40s or 50s And then maybe we'll marry them because we want a little bit more of a Foundation if we're going to bring children into the world But we don't want to do that too soon because children are such a Such a bind on my lifestyle. Yeah, they are and then they're glorious They have a common table but not a common bed And well common table common bed. I ate with her. I slept with her. Isn't that the way dating goes now? They are in the flesh but they do not live after the flesh Well, what does he mean? They're they're not non-player characters just consumed by their own appetites And again, you can see other philosophies doing similar things You can see these patterns and and and the philosophers and that's what sort of Then creates well the the common frame of understanding and dialogue but something else is going on with them and and it's not just the The exception the monk to it. It's the it's the regular guy who who seems to be like everyone else in his nation or tribe, but He's a little different and it's hard to exactly nail the relevance the relevance realization of their uniqueness They pass their days on earth, but they are citizens of heaven They obey the prescribed laws and at the same time surpass the laws by their very lives They love all men and are persecuted by all they are unknown and condemned They are put to death and restored to life They are poor yet make many rich they are let They are in lack of all things and yet abound in all they are dishonored and yet and their very dishonor are glorified They are they are evil. Um, they are evil spoken of and yet are justified They are reviled and yet bless they are insulted and repay the insult with honor. They do good Yet are punished as evildoers When punished they rejoice as if quickened into life And this is where you see there's some really new translations that needed because If you read enough older stuff, you can kind of enjoy that Um that strangeness of language and it becomes holy in that sense because it's unusual but a lot of it isn't understood. Well They are assailed by jews as foreigners and are persecuted by greeks yet those who hate them are unable to assign any reason for their hatred Well, I just don't like them well, why Because they're resisting your colonization Because what you really want to do is make them non-player characters And so you can see You know obviously spending a lot of times in this corner, you know in this political corner of the internet with a lot of libertarians and Well, what's the idea beneath this libertarian idea? It's that people ought to be free. Well Well that comes out of the enlightenment Well, the enlightenment comes out of the reformation and the reformations and all of the renaissance and that all goes back to classical period Yes, but you can see where It's these christians that are Living this out on a mass scale and and that's really I mean you'll find random philosophers and strange people sort of exhibiting some of these things But what jesus seems to do is redo the code and through the church code seems to be rewritten that on a massive scale more and more people sort of are able to begin to get into the foothills of this kind of living And and they themselves be desire to go further up and for further in on a larger and larger scale And we're image bearers See, we're not npcs of him. We're we're image bearers because we are reflecting but we're reflecting that creativity And and and so it's both it's it's both reflection and freedom I mean begin again because it's not just Duplication my children's are not just duplicates of me they are They they reflect me, but they're bringing something new. They're again tolkien called them sub creators and unfair Unfairly stories if you've ever read that essay of his We must reflect in order to actually gain the freedom and this is reciprocal broadening. And so Yes, we are image bears. We are we are we be we sort of We can't even say we begin as non-player characters because we're always destined to become real game players The the opposite is not reflection but mere repetition Which is reciprocal narrowing because the copy of the copy of the copy and so what what must come into us is Well, that's why christians use the language the holy spirit to receive the holy spirit And why does the holy spirit in pauline terms mean? well, not just an Ability to resist the drink Or the desire or the passions or the epithumias that not just that and kind of a We're going to lock them down and again churches have betrayed this many times certainly not going to get me to Tell fairy stories about the church well you will and you won't But but suddenly to have this spring out of new life and to and to be desirable and to transcend and to become Non-player characters to become a real boy Which which reflects not only the pattern But the source of pattern creating The source of pattern creating Can non-theism work this line of thinking makes me think no Why To be original to be free to be a real game player. We must reflect this freedom. There's something of the sun That must somehow get into us This Well, how does it get into the moon Well, there's the pattern there's a deep irony here to be to be sources. We must be united with the source We are too small too shallow too too self self originating We didn't originate ourselves We came from our parents we we didn't come up with all these grand ideas of the culture all of these You know, it's so funny when I watch people arguing that the That the humanist christian morality they inherited but it feels so natural to them is just Suddenly it started with them and it's obviousness and it's like Well, let's put you in a japanese internment camp and just see how obvious it is Again one of the dramatic lines of that book is it's a rare thing to meet a saint And here's the funny things about saints they're they're hard to describe Because there's that there's that creative source. That's there's that there's that sun that's reflecting And and with my my jif isn't running here. I want my jif to run. There we go Because the sun is so there's someone in a CRC church that I preach in sometimes that works for the jet He's worked for the basically he works in an organization that does nothing but study the sun and you can go to websites and look at live images of the sun and you know the kind of the When you watch fire burn, there's a reason people, you know could confuse god with mere fire and It's because somehow you can see through fire and say well i'm seeing through to the creative center of the universe And when you watch images of the sun, you can just sort of watch it and it's just always changing and and you could say Yeah, but that's just playing on your npc brain. Okay, but Yeah, you're you're you're You're barking at the door of a meaning crisis with that one Because it's now this is just a little film loop, of course, but It's just changing and so in order in order for me to have that quality I need to somehow be united with that quality. And of course, well, what's the language for that? Well the holy spirit, of course the so holy spirit comes in me and and and displaces or Dispossesses or at least retards because they haven't all gone away and me by any means The little patterns in me And suddenly I can participate in a far larger pattern a pattern that goes to the foundations of the universe and ends in the glorious The glorious Remaking of this universe into one which is better and without decay and will go on and on and on that's the christian story That's the christian vision We are suddenly in a place where We are susceptible to demons and we need a power greater than ourselves And so non-theism What's your source Freedom can be a fudgy word, but it's what we desire, isn't it? It's it's it's freedom from the demons Now which frame are you talking out of paul? Well, talking out of both of them it's freedom from the demons. Well, what are the demons? Well, you know what your demons are if I say it that way, you know exactly what i'm saying And and you want to be connected with that source of light and life you are the sun. I am the moon Give me that Creativity that power and and and when you give it to me, may it not be as sauron Colonizes but but may it be that My creativity and my power Are in alignment with yours so that well, and this is exactly how we find jesus talking about himself in the gospel of john That I and the father are one why we do the same things well, why do you do the same things and why jesus are you so fresh? Why are and you know the woman comes to the well? Well, you should have asked me for water. What do you mean? You don't have a bucket I would have given you Springs of living water that well up well that would sure be nice indoor plumbing would be an advantage So I could just stay home because all the women of the village hate me Because i'm hotter than them and I colonize their men And she becomes The apostle to the village I found the messiah a samaritan What kind of messiah are you looking for? Well in some way we're all looking for the same messiah. We're all looking for the genuine article We're all looking for the source of light and life We're all looking for the thing that that makes us drunk, but never really drunk that refreshes us But this freshness does not grow old We're looking for freedom What we desire but not that Our desires we would be cloyed our palates would be cloyed from from from that pleasure and now that we have fat and sugar and Amusements and netflix and internet and all of these things and and all kinds of ways to to amuse ourselves to death suddenly we realize Well, we saw something in there that that for a moment was fresh But it was unstable and we couldn't maintain it if I could put time in a bottle All The freedom to shine to reflect the first light to reflect the first cause But but not to to be united with it, but not to lose ourselves To reflect embody repeat creativity life-givingness authenticity, isn't that what we want? We want to shine We need to be with but with the one who shines We we understand non-player characters, but we want to be a real boy
