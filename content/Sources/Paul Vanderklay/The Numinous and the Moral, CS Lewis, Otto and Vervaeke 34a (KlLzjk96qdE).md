 Hi, this is Paul. I wanted to do a video working on Vervecky and CS Lewis. Now for a lot of you I've done a fair amount of talk with Peterson and Lewis but haven't done a whole lot with Vervecky and Lewis with the exception of my conversation with John when we got into the idea of how to approach the unknown and with the spirit of finesse versus the spirit of geometry let's say to use Pascal's language and I got into CS Lewis's book Miracles. Now it's really helpful to think about what John Vervecky is doing with this series and then in some episodes and other interviews he's talked about having a religion without religion and we'll get into a little bit more about what that means, but he is trying to afford the things that have been lost in the meaning crisis to offer to people who for whom at this point at least they say that religion is a place they just can't go and so how what are practices what are What are practices what are what are what are ways in which the meaning crisis can be overcome and Again one of the really excellent videos was the one on the symptoms of the meaning crisis, which is well worth watching How can we afford meaning the meaning of the Axial Age religions after the disenchantment of the modern period and and there will be practices you'll be in the All the language that he has I'm not gonna go through it a bunch of it now But that's that's the project again I've been following along with following along with the series very much enjoying the series One of the one of the big things I think he's given is a lot of language and understanding Alternative language for things that if you've been attentive within a religious or a Christian space you can have some appreciation Oh, that's how that's what we're doing and how that's working at least within the realm of as The book of Ecclesiastes says life under the Sun Now he's trying to avoid trying to avoid BS trying to avoid Equivocation trying to avoid fooling ourselves. And so he's walking through all of this stuff carefully Now he just had a conversation with Sevilla that's right. Okay, go go forget her name Sevilla and her channel a quality a quality existence And that was a very good conversations of only actually it's a fairly long conversation But I shouldn't talk I've listened to about half of it but I thought it was very very helpful for understand both of their understanding both of their perspectives and understanding where John is coming from and he gave a nice little definition of his physicalism and he and and JPMarceau have been talking about his physicalism versus JPS panpsychism And there's some if you look at JP's channel, you can find some of those conversations there But his physicalism very much is a piece of his overall project because he is trying to fit in the a renewed ability to have meaning within a physicalist frame and Again, I think his his relevance realization is a very helpful concept and it's it's extremely useful when I see all the ways that it works within his system and As is true once you learn something and you're walking around thinking about it and you bump into things as like oh, yeah That's true relevance realization and intelligence. Wow, there's that's that's very true thing there's a lot of deep connections there and his relevance realization and spirituality that that that very fudgy word there's there's a ton of Of connections in that between those two areas and and what I appreciate about his description about Physicalism is that there's a space for real relationality. That's what I would call it And as I've noted on other on other videos Long before any of this started when I was seriously pondering writing a book It would have been in a sense against materialism and in favor of relationality as simply being an aspect That materialism lacks and so his physicalism affords that relationality which which I appreciate even though I Do embrace what he would call? supernaturalism and that's a that's a part of theism but I I Resist the framing of it in that way because I think in some ways framing natural and supernatural Natural divorces and And I think resists the kind of relating to God that we see for example in the Gospel of John which is what I'm going through with my adult Sunday school class and So while I tend to think that that the real story of the Bible You know, it is it's very much understood within an axial age template It's the reconciliation of heaven and earth and in and in that way it maps on rather nicely to barfields final participation it's really the the the healing of the division that begins in Genesis 3 in the in the Garden of Eden that's that's sort of the the narrative structure of the Bible, especially from a Confessionally reformed point of view where there's creation rebellion Redemption restoration that's that's in sort of a Dutch Calvinist Kiperian framework for the story of the world and So this was I thought that again This was a terrific conversation between John and Sevilla now and then third episode 34 broke and I was Making videos and Friday was a very busy day So I didn't get a chance to listen to it Friday and I knew I'd listen to it this week and I haven't even finished The whole episode I've listened to the first 40 minutes of it twice now And so I won't do really an in-depth commentary and I'm still having issues with my software and I have to learn another Piece of software if I really want to do the comment videos that I like doing but some of the some of the some of the Early reviews on the discord server were harsh Which were which I found rather amusing and then again I laugh when other people think you shouldn't laugh at that pastor But I don't know. I always tend to find it funny. I think we should I think we should I Think we should hold our ideas with a certain amount of levity. Let's play with them. Let's talk about them Let's not get you know, let's let's not let's not get all Let's not get too serious with one another as we're working through the kind of stuff that none of us can fully grasp Okay so that's that's my position on these things and one of the one of the first things that dropped through from a couple of the the Philosophy lovers on the discord server was was compatible ism for vakey is a compatible list now now Compatible ism is what you throw around when basically you have two things that you really can't fully reconcile Rationally or display it and so you just say huh? And this is this is in many ways part of how I deal with my Calvinism Well, we have of course divine election and and all that that means but we have human agency And God takes that agency seriously. Well, can I really put those two things together? Not that I've been really able to explain. Okay. Molinism is out there and I I'm not really keen on molinism so much, but I'm in some ways I'd rather be a shallow compatible list when it comes to Cavaliers Calvinist were a shallow Compatible list when it comes to Calvinism that says I can't really put these these two things together they're both in the Bible and There they are and I'm not gonna give up on either side even if I can't make it work I will I will Take it by faith even the the cheap version of the of faith that that some would like to say and say God knows I don't I can live with that these tea these things as the psalmist says are too wonderful for me But but in in the context of verveky's video, I understood their complaint of compatibilism saying He ain't doing it. He ain't doing it So, okay, and I'll let those I think some of these conversations might come up in some Future conversations that I'm gonna have with certain individuals in the discord channel, but I'll I'll leave that at that Another big fan of you you He was not happy with this video either and so I I found their Dissatisfaction with the video when it dropped on Friday Interesting it's like oh they really didn't like this video so much and so that made me eager to watch it Now as always your mileage will vary. I really enjoyed the first 40 minutes of this video a lot. I I Was happy he got into auto and and some of the issues there I just got up to look for my copy of auto and I couldn't find it but but that's okay I again, I really enjoyed this and I wonder sort of what people expect. There's a One of the things that really struck me about the conversation with Sevilla Was that I thought I thought verveky was particularly clear in some areas in that conversation You know the if you You can if you look at the the Peterson stuff Okay, so here's here's part of what we're dealing with that the world is simply too big for us to manage all right, and so When we when you get into flow states, you know, there's there's kind of a there's kind of a hyper processing that happens But but part of but part of the experience of sacredness now verveky distinguishes the sacred as sort of the ontological existent source of sacredness and sacredness then is is sort of the sort of our experience of the sacred, okay, so that's sacredness and and a very a secular ish Perhaps Kantian way you make that distinction so that okay We're gonna we're gonna put that the question of the sacred sort of over here and there's sacredness So let's talk about this experience of sacredness and let's deal with that well, well, there's a there's very much a relationship between the experience of sacredness and the even in a a Viewpoint under the Sun. Okay, I'm still using a Ecclesiastes nomenclature. There's just so much so much here that you can get an overflowing of sacredness and Which is just part partly just simply the rush of everything that there is and I loved what he said about what he's what he talked about in terms of music and in terms of you know, what what music is and so often the relationship between music and the sacred is is so important and I'm thinking I really have to do figure out my My software approach and against again the issue isn't technical The issue is me spending time to learn a new process to make my videos and I don't want to because My old process if the software worked fine worked perfectly well, and this is just me being a curmudgeon But anyway, so so you've got sacredness and the world and our experience of the sacredness. Okay our experience which is the sacredness our experience of what we perceive to be sacred and And I think sometimes people You know, it's sort of like when Akira the Don makes the point how naked can Madonna get there's There's a there's a sense in which neo Neo modesty somehow is far more attractive than Ongoing brazen Pulling the pulling the curtain back. All right, and the thing about a Theistic conception of the divine a God who is holy holy holy This God is inexhaustible What does that mean? What does that mean for us? Well, we we will never exhaust God God exhausts us that's that's basic to the idea of Christianity and the God in the Bible, you know so Moses asks to see God's face and God puts Moses in the cleft of the rock and goes back to back and announces his name there while Well, you know that that's what he gives Moses and and the what that story acts out is We can't see God Because it exhausts us utterly and we are destroyed now in my pastoral experience. I find that we secularist moderns have a hard time with this and I and I think this is this is sort of the This is sort of the problem that you have explaining things to children Because a child's world is small and so if you want to explain something which is really rather large To a child whose world is small because they've only had a certain amount of experience Well, it's it's very difficult for someone who's had more experience because they have to all shrink it sort of down and and when we tell people well you know God is Is not the being that you can just casually saunter into the throne room and you know strike a pose and ask a few questions This is what's behind this biblical motif of If you see God you'll die and again, we think well what why why and it's sort of like a Child asking why why CS Lewis had this great comparison once when he was talking about trying to explain sex to a child and the child asks will there be chocolate and Because the best the child can imagine in terms of the numinous or ecstasy or something more is Chocolate and the adult sort of smiles and thinks well you might do something with chocolate if you want to But when you get to that point Chocolate probably won't be what's on your mind. Okay, and and So when we talk about we're not able to see God it's because this kind of being even with the minimal apprehension of eyesight Would completely destroy us and again, I've used various images to try to explain that in the past but but it's at this point when okay, well, let's talk about that which is sacred and and Verbeke sometimes in both in these lectures and in in the conversation with Sevilla talks about some of these Taoist ideas and Buddhist ideas that there are things we can't put into words and now whenever you put a Taoist or a Buddhist label on something like that Christians will automatically reject it and that's this isn't this is a Response which is in and itself not necessarily a bad response, but this is an instinctive response that certain tribal groups initiate in themselves to protect themselves against other things and that's Right, but if you look at what he's saying, this is exactly What theism offers when it says you can't see God you can't capture God And this is exactly what's behind the commandment to not make a graven image Because the minute that you create that image and you just for a minute imagine you have captured it You've now become an idolater because you have formed an image and you have reduced that which is God to an image that you can manipulate and Now John Calvin very famously says the human mind is an idle factory There are a lot of layers to that statement one of which is we can't help but even without graven images image God in some ways and and in many ways my God number one and God number two that's that's what we're dealing with because we have to try to conceptualize to get a handle on God and and this is why there is a Even though I don't practice it there is a real wisdom in Judaism that won't even say Hashem the name the problem is that you keep pushing that back now Hashem is the name in Hebrew is the The thing that you're using we we can't help but have a conception if we're going to interact With it, but the wise person always knows We should realize that this conception is our own Okay, and is an accommodation that we must use and in fact in terms of Scripture God accommodates Himself to us and when for example God shows up with the three strangers to visit Abraham God shows up in the burning bush God shows up on top of Mount Sinai All of these theophanies in Scripture are accommodations because we are small and in order to relate to him There needs to be something we relate to and of course this comes into the question in Christianity of the incarnation And Jesus because Jesus as the book of Colossians says in Greek Jesus is the icon of the invisible God and even when we use the word invisible Well God is invisible because if we were to see him we would be destroyed and again I Fully understand that some of you out there when I say those words if we see God we are destroyed We'll say I don't buy that because you've never perhaps had the experience of seeing something that destroys you now Talk to veterans Talk to abuse victims talk to people who have seen horrific crime scenes now we have different ways of saying it that can't be Unseen and it wakes them up at night and they dream about it. You know part of what happens with Trauma is it destroys us and I think in verve keys I think it was 13 when he talked about you know this idea of His conceptualization of Buddhism, which I never quite heard before I mean even trauma Takes away our agency and it disables us That's part of the reason that I think that trauma is so deeply linked to something like alcoholism or substance abuse Reading Bessel Bessel van de Kock's excellent book the body keeps the score You know one of the things that he said is you know part of the way Europe just survived was alcohol Because they just drank through their traumas and and even though we know that Alcohol is not a great way to cope with trauma It helped people survive and and in that sense, you know, we have all these accommodation methods, but We can't even take in General responsibility General revelation in All of its magnitude that's the point that Peterson was making with Sam Harris That's the point that John verve key is making with his his cognitive science That the world is simply too rich and so in order for us to fit it into our thick skulls We have to reduce it and we have Amazing ways of reducing it so that we can in fact Work productively in the world, but even in terms of general revelation that which is available to us From zero to eighty with eyes and ears and touch and taste With all of that we can't take in the world. And so when Christianity and the Bible says things like you can't see God and live If we can't take in general Well, if we can't take in general revelation, how would we take in God What do you mean by God? We're gonna keep talking about that in fact That could be one thing that we talk about again and again and again because even using that Lou that little word the reduction of it has I think Turned off people to what we're talking about and misled people. Okay So you can't see God and live because Just as the inexhaustibility of God is real and in CS Lewis's last battle is further up and further and we can never exhaust God in the New Narnia as CS Lewis has in the last battle or the new heavens and the new earth as the book of Revelation has we we God can exhaust us That's what it means for us to be finite that's what it means for us to be human and so I don't know what you were expecting from poor John in episode 34, but There's only so much curtain you can pull back before we say up we flip over and that's enough and we Check out. All right Software still isn't working, right What I saw immediately when I listened to episode 34 was that verveky is walking parallel to CS Lewis Now that might strike you as surprising. I had a conversation with someone who made the observation that this is someone that that knows both John and Jordan Peterson and someone who knows both of their work very very well Part of what differentiates John and Jordan's work there's a lot that differentiates both of them But part of what differentiates their work is is Jordan speaks in mythological terms That's what he's doing. That's part of the reason of his popularity Jordan has learned to speak in mythological words in a sufficiently engaging way to captivate the imaginations of Millions of people or at least hundreds of thousands would know how many are captivated but what what Jordan Reaches into when he does his work is this symbolic world with Jonathan Pujo has been articulating and explaining in some sense drawing the relationships the language of mythology is in many ways a A multi-sensory Cross linguistic Way of communicating deeply with human beings, which is why is just part of the reason the Bible is such as Is such an astoundingly successful book in terms of the human race the what the Bible speaks Mythologically now again, I'm using the word mythos not in terms of a a false story Oh, that's a myth. That's one way of saying it's a false story But in terms of this manner of speaking fairy tales speak mythologically Star Wars speaks mythologically the Avengers speaks mythologically And so it's the symbolic world that Jonathan Pujo is helping us see more clearly by drawing the relationships And there's no accident that he's an artist because this is this is what he works with This is the language that he uses when he does his art Okay, so so Peterson speaks mythology John Verveke is speaking The account the language of the Academy he is walking through careful distinctions developing vocabularies Developing nomenclature and and so for a lot of people Listening to John Verveke is not as much fun as listening to Jordan Peterson because Jordan Peterson is speaking mythology There's a lot more people watching Star Wars than are watching lectures by college profs on YouTube. Okay if you read Alistair Roberts a Great blog post on an early blog post. I think it was May 2018 where he talks about Jordan Peterson And he connects him with CS Lewis, which again was a connection that I made very very quickly listening to Jordan Peterson I found a lot of similarity between Lewis and Jordan Peterson Because they're both speaking the language of mythology Now Lewis spoke various languages as he went through his career early in his career He wrote well screw tape letters very much the language of mythology a pilgrim's regress Was an allegory and then he wrote some of these apologetics books miracles and the problem of pain After the apologetic apologetics books, he then went back to writing The Chronicles of Narnia until we have faces till we have faces probably his most mature adult piece of fiction really some Biographers saying co-written by Joy Davidman who would become his wife And then the last book Lewis wrote which was much more within his work of literature, but very much within his other pieces which was the The discarded image which I think is a very very helpful book. Well as Verrechi got into episode 34 when he got into Rudolph Otto He was very much getting into CS Lewis. There's a book out there CS Lewis's list Ten books that influenced him most now. You'll notice I'm gonna start You know, I talked about I'm Trying to figure out what the relationship is between this YouTube these YouTube conversations Which haven't got away and my day life as a pastor. So I opened up an Amazon affiliate link and so now my book links are gonna be in the Amazon affiliate type links and Go ahead and have out in the comment section whether I should or shouldn't do business with Amazon But I'm just gonna try this out and see what happens with it. Anyway CS Lewis's list is a book where the ten books that most influenced him and Let's open up my kindle app Here we are. So this is the book and if you look at the well, what are these ten books George McDonald's? Fantasties George McDonald's was an very important person for CS Lewis GK Chesterton's everlasting man the Aeneid by Virgil remember Lewis was a all his life was a Ardent classicist even though his day job was in medieval scholarship George Herbert's the temple William Wadsworth the prelude Rudolph Otto's the idea of the Holy Boethius the consolation of philosophy James Boswell The life of Samuel Johnson Charles Williams another member of the Inklings for a short time Descent into hell and Arthur James Balfour's theism and humanism now I have a lot of reading to do if I'm gonna read this list Well what this book rather nicely does is help you get into Some of what Lewis was reading and so he'll walk through the idea of the Holy Platonic eros which in my conversations with skip I very much have to get up on I Very much have to get an understanding and what we're talking about when we're talking about arrows Sense such is a vitally important idea for CS Lewis This is a sort of spiritual longing the origin of this German word has been lost to time But we know that it was a word that was in vogue in the 18th and 19th century along with the great Austrian and German composers such as Mozart Beethoven and Schubert and the early and late German romantic writers such as Goethe Schiller and Novalis Lewis had read or had tried to read Goethe and Novalis in German while studying with Kirkpatrick between 1914 and 1917 However given Lewis's poor proficiency in German and relative neglect of the language through its life It's just as likely as not that his appropriation of the word sense such came from sources other than the German romantics And then he'll get into William James variety of religious experience They'll get into joy the third species of spiritual longing That is what Lewis called joy and he talks about joy now a lot of this stuff is before his conversion Okay, that's really helpful to remember because sometimes Christians and having these issues with the software this looks dark now I'll go back and I'll go back and now it's correct. I don't know. I'm gonna switch software. It's gonna happen So a lot of times Christians when they deal with Lewis really like to emphasize well the Christian Lewis, but don't forget Lewis spent a Good number of years as an atheist and a lot of the learning he did he did as an atheist and a lot of reading He did he did as an atheist and so Lewis had a deep attraction to romanticism and I really appreciated for Vickie's video on romanticism because it helped me sort of locate it and recognize romanticism as a As in a sense an early attempt to address the unfolding meaning crisis It's it's it's an attempt to address Cartesian dualism and it's it's a not particularly successful attempt and It has certain aspects that are problematic and for Vickie talks about that quite a bit but it makes complete sense that Lewis very early on so again Lewis is Is raised in Belfast Ireland his mother dies when he's six years old And he and Warney his older brother sort of reach his father is Sort of shell-shocked by his mother's death Lewis's mother was a lovely brilliant loving caring nurturing woman who deeply loved her two sons Well, what happens when you lose a mother like that? What happens to Lewis's father when you lose a wife like that? Well, well the the the father Lewis's father basically someone reading into it later might say, you know This was a trauma Lewis's father never Recovered from and especially giving what men were in that day and age He was a he was a lawyer He loved his son certainly but didn't know how to connect with them didn't know how to relate with them and And there were various aspects both Lewis and Warney went into the military Warney became a career soldier Lewis just in for the stint in World War one had the kind of wound that took him out of the war Before he was killed and left him in the hospital for the duration of the war Lewis was missing a joint on one of his Thumbs so he's never very good at sports Lewis did not get on very well in The English boarding school environment in fact It was hell for Lewis which led him to eventually go and study with Kirk Patrick who was his father's tutor Warney was much more of a man's man He fit in well in the military and Warney loved boarding school and so Warney did fine with that Warney eventually also became a scholar Warney also was an alcoholic later in life. So Here's a little bit of complexity into Lewis's life Now so at the age of six Lewis loses his mother Okay, and Lewis's my if I recall correctly loose his mother loses his mother to cancer Which Lewis will eventually lose his his wife Joy Davidman to cancer later on and the adult Lewis will Process some of that in a grief observed which is an important companion book to the problem of pain Alright, so so Lewis loses his mother and his father is in shock from the trauma and can't relate to his boys and and Warney Sort of does better because he can fit into the English boarding school ways but before they go to boarding school Warney and Lewis in a sense retreat into the imagination and And their boys now remember they retreat into the imagination and they they have their little animals They play with they create an imaginary little world that they play with and so they retreat into mythology and mythology Anyone who looks at mythology understands if you look at my conversation with Sevilla and she talks about What she noticed doing clinical psycho, you know doing clinical psychology in poor neighborhoods Which is full of religion if you look at I don't have dignity here but that book part of the reason why well Chris Arnade finds All of these poor people being religious. Well religion is what you do So, okay, let's give Jesse Ventura his due if you're flooded with trauma Well, you can hit the bottle or you can get religion you can do both for a while But at some point the bottle or religion is going to win out which is part of the reason 12 steps works. All right so Lewis is traumatized by the death of his mother and he and Warney retreat into a Rich myth of old mythological world and then Warney is ripped from him. I think Warney is something like two years older He's ripped from him and he goes off to boarding school and young Jack. See is left alone Well, this is a where does he do he retreats into his head? but then you know churches in a sense the The the Legalistic father and so his father drags him to church and at some point Lewis is like enough of this and then religion is thrust down his throat at boarding school and it it just looks Hypocritical and duplicitous and enough of this and so he became an angry atheist all of that trauma probably produced anger in him as A as a young man and then he's he's he's Kirkpatrick sees that he's clearly he's clearly intellectually gifted far beyond any Student that Kirkpatrick ever had and remember Kirkpatrick is the kind of atheist. He's a Bertrand Russell atheist Okay, this this is it. This is a guy who He has zero Tolerance for religion and so he trains Lewis up as a as an ardent atheist and equips Lewis with everything but sort of like The Russian mistake in the Soviet Union they forgot to take Dostoevsky and Tolstoy off the shelves Well, you're gonna read the classics your Sam Harris type defense against the religious arts are gonna have to be pretty strong and they weren't strong enough to endure the rape of the First World War and and so Lewis has all of this and he goes off to war and he makes a pact with his friend and he goes off to War and his friend dies and they sits out the rest of the war in the hospital and then he meets his friend's mother who he's pledged to take care of as a you know as a young man and then proceeds quite likely to have a romantic and sexual relationship with his friend's mother and Sort of lives with her on and off while he's pursuing an academic career at Oxford and becomes an Oxford Don and So you can understand how well first you're going to try to satisfy the meaningless world with what with classics and with mythology and with romanticism because that meaning crisis must be addressed and then of course he runs into Dyson and Tolkien and And Then he becomes a Christian but all of that learning up until then that doesn't go to waste Just like I'll often ask the question. Why does God wait? Why does Jesus wait to show up on the road to Damascus for the conversion of the Apostle Paul? Surely Stephen's family would say well couldn't you have intervened a little earlier and maybe that would have not meant Stephen's martyrdom seems God works this way and so All of this stuff before goes into making Lewis Who Lewis becomes all right, and so one of the things he has to deal with is romanticism and and so in surprised by joy, which is another which is Lewis's sort of by autobiography a lot of biographers by Biographers of Lewis, you know don't have a tremendous amount of respect for Lewis as an autobiographer It's just Lewis likes telling a story. We don't see ourselves real Well in surprised by joy Lewis says that through his childhood indeed through his entire life Neither his parents neither of his parents ever listened to the horns of Elfland a Phrase which he borrowed from Tennyson's poem the princess and one which both he and Tolkien thought captured an important aspect of the best sort of romanticism not of not of titanic characters the macabre the Revolution dangerous adventures egoism nor nature but of the preternatural the marvelous the marvelous is romantic provided it does not make part of the belief Provided it does not make part of the believed religion thus magicians ghosts fairies witches dragons nymphs and dwarfs are Romantic angels less so Greek gods are Romantic and mr. James Stevens or mr. Horace Hewlett Not so in Homer or Sophocles in this sense Mallory and see I don't know most of these people are Romantic authors nevertheless well this kind of romantic literature Lewis liked best both when he was very young and very old it was not what he meant when he wrote a Subscript under the pilgrims regress which reads an allegorical Apology for Christianity reason and romanticism What Lewis meant by romanticism in 1932 this is around the time of his conversion, okay? was a particular recurrent Experience which dominated his childhood and adolescence and which he hastily called Romantic because in animate nature and marvelous literature were among the things that evoked it All right, so so you can hear right away Well, how is young Lewis dealing with his meaning crisis with romanticism with with mythology? And I think this is part of the reason that Jordan Peterson struck a note so hard in Many within the Sam Harris camp They're feeling the angst of the of the meaning crisis and the horns of Elfland in Jordan Peterson's imagination rang through his lectures and people stopped and heard like the boy CS Lewis like the adolescent CS Lewis But this then gets into the numinous and and and for the idea of the holy is as the subtitle says an inquiry into the non rational factor in the idea of the divine and its Relation to the relational now. It's helpful to remember that Well, let's see if the biography is here. It's at the beginning of this section Okay, Rudolph Otto was an influential German theologian who was active in the first half of the 20th century And whose most important work the idea of the holy and those in the German discord can say it in German. I can't Was a significant influence not only on the field of comparative religion in general But on CS Lewis the philosopher theologian and imaginative writer in particular Until the day he died Otto was a self-confessed Lutheran who tried to navigate through both the secular efforts to reduce religious experience to something more primary and Existential efforts which insisted that religion is a purely subjective phenomena. In other words in some ways here In some ways here In some ways here All Rudolph Otto would have been very much in keeping with a lot of verve keys project, but he Comes at it as a German Lutheran theologian who stayed within the Lutheran Church In many ways Otto who tried to defend both rational and non rational Aspects of religion was a kindred spirit to Lewis who himself Found in Christ the unity of both romance and reason Nevertheless in broader strokes Lewis who had had philosophical training and underwent a philosophical conversion to orthodox Christianity Emphasized rationality you can read that in miracles Emphasized rationality and orthodoxy more than Otto for example in his edition of Otto's religious essays a supplement to the idea of the holy Lewis underlined Otto's claims that Christianity is superior to other religions not as truth is superior to falsehood But as Plato is superior to Aristotle so you can have your own little fight there Otto's point is that Christianity has a highly individual and particular spirit a felt spiritual Intensity and perhaps also a moral edge over other religions But Lewis who said he converted to Christianity because he thought it true did not feel the same way Rather Lewis said that there is only one right answer just as one plus one equals two But some answers may be closer to the truth than others just as three is closer than four Back in 1981 the great Lewis scholar James Como complained There is no major treatment of Rudolph Otto's the idea of the holy or description of its influence In any of the works of CS Lewis although David Downing's controversial book into the region of all Mysticism and CS Lewis comes the closest in doing so Como's complaint is still justified which is to say that although the idea of the holy has been a major influence of the Oxford Don through few Lewis scholars have read it much less tried to see in some detail how it fits in Lewis's thought My purpose in this chapter is to go a ways towards doing so though probably not as fully as Como would like Nevertheless since the most important Autonian influence on Lewis was his robust conception of the numinous experience or the experience of the holy I think it's best for me to focus on this and I'll just moreover since Otto's numinous overlaps in so many important ways with other religions Other experiences Lewis encountered and spoke of over the years Platonic Eros in 1915 Sensach in 1922 Joy in 1924 all those dates are before Lewis's conversion Romanticism in 1932 my intention is to situate Lewis's 1936 encounter with Lewis's numinous Chronologically and philosophically within the Oxford Don's larger theory of spiritual longing In other words there's a lot of ground that needs to be covered before getting to Otto and his numinous So then when he gets down to the numinous, I'll have a little bit more to say about him The idea of the holy as the subtitle says is an inquiry into the non rational factor in the idea of the divine and its relation to the rational For Otto the rational and non rational are not so much about a contrast between thinking and feeling as between what is What is to what can be predicated or unequivocally spoken or of the numin or of the numin the divine the holy or God and what cannot be predicated Okay, this very much gets into what what vervecchi has been talking about but only equivocally or analogically spoken of Whatever can be conceptually thought of in respect to God such as what such as that he is love is a rational aspect of God from the point of view of the creature And whatever cannot be so thought of conceptually such as the dying God or Jesus claim that the father and I are one is non rational This language we should pause to note is not the language that Lewis himself would use Lewis who received a philosophical training more properly will say that things that rational creatures cannot conceptually understand about God are not in fact non rational As if to imply that we could never understand them but are in fact supra rational Meaning that if God were to give his superior powers of rationality as we know he will in the next life Then such things could be rationally understood just as God rationally understands all that he himself is The non rational for Lewis but not for Otto is a term used of things that are truly incapable of rationality Of rationality. Okay. And he'll go into this here and so is it going to read anything else Then he gets into mythology. Consequently, Lewis like Otto had little sympathy for modernist interpretations of scripture stoic allegorizations of the myth standing to the original cult rather than to modernism to Christianity Lewis says because he insisted that by totally contemplating or allegorizing myths something inextricable and mysterious is actually lost And I think this is part of the difference between the experience that many have listening to Jordan Peterson's Myths of Modernism And I think this is part of the difference between the experience that many have listening to Jordan Peterson's Mythos laden speech versus John Verbecky's academic laying out of the ideas is is this is part of the difference For while all myths can be interpreted allegorically where you are given at least according to Lewis's narrow view of allegory one thing in terms of another Myths at their best resist putting put in the wrong place. So we have to be careful about that. For while all myths can be interpreted allegorically where you are given at least according to Lewis's narrow view of allegory one thing in terms of another Myths at their best resist putting put being put into strict conceptual terms. This is part of what we talk about when we say the Bible is inexhaustible myths are in some ways inexhaustible now I know I'm talking about stuff that I don't have to get into now but I just make that point. But it remains true that whatever symbol that whenever the symbols are best the key is at least adequate now in the second part of the video that I haven't listened to Verbecky goes into the whole question of symbolism For an allegory is at its best it approaches myth which must be grasped with the imagination not with the intellect. It is the sort of thing you cannot learn from definition. You must rather get to know it. I think this is probably part of the reason that Lewis switched over to fiction for the last books he wrote in his life. This is to say that myth points to an essentially non-conceptual supra-rational thing. In poetry the words are the body and the theme or content is the soul. But in myth the imagined events are the body and something inexpressible is the soul. So if you want to pick up this book the title is C.S. Lewis's List the 10 books that influenced him most. And that's what the cover looks like. Now that book came to me secondarily because this book came to me first which is the problem of pain. So lots of different covers little bit of mythology here in the problem of pain. Here we have the sea the sea of chaos here in this particular cover of the problem of pain. Lewis's books go through so many printings there are so many different covers that get put out with each different edition that gets put out. So here on the cover of this problem of pain we have this nice vision of the waves. And some of those of you who know Christian hymnody might think of that great hymn. When peace like a river attendeth my way when sorrows like sea billows roll whatever my lot he has taught me to say it is well it is well with my soul. And of course if you Google this hymn you will notice that the author writes this hymn upon getting the news that his family was drowned in the sinking of a ship. And so the sea in the symbolism of the Bible begins the story of the Bible with the Tohu Wavohu chaos in Genesis 1. And so many of Jesus parables and Jesus Galilean ministry is over by the sea and that has deep symbolic resonance. Now in Lewis's preface to the problem of pain it is actually a very important preface to read because Lewis did not want to write this book but his publisher very much wanted him to write this book. And Lewis says in Oxford 1940 that the reason he shouldn't write this book is because he has not undergone enough pain. Now some Lewis biographers and commentators have a lot to say about this preface because this is a man who survived the death of his mother at age 6. This is a man who survived the trenches of World War I. This is a man who had a lot of pain growing up. Now many biographers psychologizing Lewis and I think with reason basically note that Lewis suppressed a lot of his pain. Lewis afforded himself a lot of denial. Lewis afforded himself a lot of obscurity. And those who wish to make Lewis a saint really have to deal with his biography. And Lewis will tell you again and again in his writings he is a sinner. And he goes to church and he goes to a plain Anglican church because he is a sinner. And sometimes he submitted to his church and sometimes he didn't. Read Alastair McGrath's biography of Lewis regarding his marriage to Joy Davidman. And some believe the way he sort of snookered the priest into performing a wedding that the priest was not supposed to perform. So Lewis is a very complicated man. Lewis at the beginning in the preface of the problem of pain suggests he hasn't known pain. Now it's only when he goes through he is in a sense broken by Davidman. He falls deeply in love with her and this time for the first time unlike the love that he likely had as a young man for the mother of his war buddy. And again Lewis never spoke a word about that. That's all intimations amidst the biographers and reading between the lines and even Lewis's closest friends. This is something in English society you didn't talk about. The relationship that Lewis had with his buddy's mother. But when it came to Joy Davidman and when you listen to Joy's the younger of the two boys that Joy had and Joy Davidman biography that I mentioned in earlier videos I should link to it here. I really enjoyed that biography of Joy Davidman. It wasn't hagiography at all. It showed Joy working with her husband. It showed Joy working with her husband. I really enjoyed that biography of Joy Davidman. It wasn't hagiography at all. It showed Joy works at all. Joy was another complicated figure. But these two when they first Lewis sort of married her so she could stay in the country. Joy very much went to England in order to lure him and seduce him while she was in fact still married. So here you have a married woman who's estranged from her husband who goes to England because she's fallen in love with this English scholar and very much wants to divorce her husband and marry him. There's nothing Christian about this whole story. And Joy is a very interesting. Joy is a Christian and a Scientologist. Think about that one. These are complicated real people. So she goes to England. She very much is in love with Lewis. She very much wants to be with Lewis and he keeps her at arm's length for a long time and sort of marries her. He's obviously interested in her. She's a very interesting woman. She's a match for Lewis intellectually which Lewis couldn't find many people who were. And they both enjoyed many of the same things. And then so when she comes down with cancer, Lewis then in a sense probably full of a fair amount of pride condescends to marry her in real life. But then they fall deeply in love. And they fall deeply in love and they experience and then there's a very famous time when she's dying of cancer and Lewis prays a prayer and has a priest come in. Lewis is known to have a gift of healing and there's a very interesting way in which some senses Joy's pain is transferred to Jack. And she has a reprieve from her cancer. It goes into remission mysteriously, almost miraculously in Lewis's terms. Now remember this is a rational guy. And so they experience some time together. They make a trip together. They have a driver's license. It's a weird dude, C.S. Lewis was. But they have a time which is just an ecstasy. And Lewis writes with such abandon in some ways, yet respectfully, you know, the joy which he had sexually with his wife. And then the cancer comes back. And then death takes her. And then Lewis writes A Grief Observed. And if you're interested in that book, go to the Rando's United channel because Job and some of the other people that I've talked with on my channel are talking through A Grief Observed. So he writes The Problem of Pain in 1940 saying he doesn't know pain and many people have complained about one of Lewis's great quotes. Pain is a megaphone to awaken a deaf world and many people who have known great pain says that's a horrible line. Lewis who had lost his mother when he was the age of six when he had survived the First World War, when he had lived his life with great duplicity, when he had resigned himself to being a bachelor in 1940 says I've never known pain. Okay, maybe you've just known a whole lot of denial. And what happens with Joy David Men is once he truly tastes joy, joys that he thought this world could not afford him, then he was open to real pain. And so again, if you read The Problem of Pain, you should also read A Grief Observed. The Introduction to A Problem of Pain, I'm going to keep my eye on the timer, this is going to be a longer video than I expected. The Introduction to A Problem of Pain, Lewis quotes Pascal. And again, I've read these books multiple times and every time I come back to them it's like I've learned all of this stuff from Peterson and Vervecky and all the Rando's I've had conversation with and all the books that I've been reading since I was a kid. And so now I return to these Lewis books and it's like, wow, it was once black and white, now it's in color. Because I've learned more and I think I understand Lewis better. And he quotes Pascal from Pensey's. I wonder at the hardy hood with which such persons undertake to talk about God. In a treatise addressed to infidels, they begin with a chapter proving the existence of God from the works of nature. These might, these, these, these such persons that Pascal is talking about. Now remember, we're talking about Blaise Pascal here who has this religious experience that is so enthralling. He writes down the date and keeps a record of it and sews it into his clothes and it's only discovered after his death. All right. This changes Pascal's life. Pascal has had an experience with the numinous that changes his world and the meaning crisis has no hold on him after that. All right. This is Blaise Pascal. I wonder at the hardy hood with which such persons undertake to talk about God. Such a little word that we use, notice this is me, such a little word that we use as children use ideas that they cannot fully master. In a treatise addressed to infidels, they begin with a chapter proving the existence of God from the works of nature. This only gives their readers grounds for thinking that the proofs of our religion are very weak. And whereas I enjoy apologetics and I will sometimes listen to celebrity apologists, I agree with Pascal on this. God is not like buying a sensible used car. It's more like falling in love. This only gives their readers grounds for thinking that the proofs of our religion are very weak. It is a remarkable fact no canonical writer has ever used nature, capital N, to prove God, capital G. Pascal, Penseys, 4, 242 and 243. Not many years ago when I was an atheist, if anyone had asked me, why do you not believe in God, my reply would have run something like this. Look at the universe we live in. By far the greatest parts of it consist of empty space, completely dark and unimaginably cold. The bodies which move in such a space are so few and so small in comparison with the space itself that even if every one of them were known to be crowded full, as it could with perfectly happy creatures, it would still be difficult to believe that life and happiness were more than a byproduct of the power that made the universe. Now I'll pause there and I was listening to one of the videos by JP and JP notes very much what Louis says. For many people, well once they saw Darwin and once had just the vision that, oh my goodness, what percentage of species that science has ever known are extinct? It's like 96%. What kind of God would create life at such a cost? Well, when Louis was an atheist, this is exactly what he thought. And he thought that, even back just looking at the world, surely life must be an accidental byproduct of the chaos of this world. As it is, however, the scientists think it likely that very few of these sons of space, perhaps none of them, except our own, have any planets. Well, we now know that not to be true. The scientists were wrong and had to be corrected. And in our own system it is improbable that any planet except Earth sustains life. And Earth herself, without life for millions of years and may exist for millions more when life has left her. And what is it like and what is it like while it lasts? It is so arranged that all forms of it can live only by preying on one another. And the lowest forms of this process entails only death. But in the higher there appears a new quality called consciousness, which enables it to be attended with pain. So now we get a sense of what Louis means by consciousness, sort of the phenomenological aspect of consciousness, if you will. My dog has consciousness, my cat has consciousness, a mouse has consciousness, a rat has consciousness. Do worms have consciousness? I don't know worms that well. Do fish have consciousness? It seems perhaps so. So the phenomenological fact that even the animals have. But with consciousness comes pain. And necessarily so in this sharp-edged world. The creatures cause pain by being born and live by inflicting pain. And in pain they mostly die. In the most complex of all creatures, man, capital M, yet another quality appears, which we call reason. Whereby he is enabled to foresee his own pain, which henceforth is preceded with acute mental suffering and to foresee his own death while keenly desiring permanence. The book of Ecclesiastes notes, God has placed eternity in our hearts, and some of us think, I'm not sure I appreciate the gift. It also enables men, by a hundred ingenious contrivances, to inflict a great deal of more pain than they otherwise could have done on one another and on the irrational creatures. Remember, he's a World War I veteran. This power they have exploited to the full. Their history is largely a record of crime, war, disease, and terror, with just sufficient happiness interposed to give them, while at last, an agonizing apprehension of losing it. And then when it is lost, the poignant misery of remembering. Every now and then they improve their condition a little, and what they call a civilization appears. But all civilizations pass away, and even while they remain, inflict peculiar sufferings of their own, probably sufficient to outweigh what alleviations they may have brought to the normal pains of man. That our own civilization has done so, no one will dispute. That it will pass all, like all its predecessors, is surely probable. The British Empire, in fact, is not like it used to be. Even if it should not, what then? The race is doomed. Every race that comes into being in any part of the universe is doomed. For the universe, they tell us, is running down and will someday be uniformed and will sometime be a uniform infinity of homogeneous matter at a low temperature. All stories will come to nothing. All life will turn out in the end to have been transitory and senseless contortion upon the idiot face of infinite matter. If you ask me to believe that this is the work of a benevolent and omnipotent spirit, I reply to all the evidence points in the opposite direction. Either there is no spirit behind the universe, or else a spirit indifferent to good or evil, or else an evil spirit. Remember, Lewis knew the classics. This menu of options was present to everyone. There is one question which I had never dreamed of raising when he was an atheist. I never noticed that the very strength and faculty of the pessimist's case at once poses us a problem. If the universe is so bad, or even half so bad, how on earth did human beings ever come to attribute it to the activity of a wise and good creator? Why on earth would that idea have ever crossed our mind, that God is good? Surely everyone agrees that God is not good, even as the celebrity atheists tell us. Men are fools, perhaps, but hardly so foolish as that. The direct inference from black to white, from evil flower to virtuous root, from senseless work to workamen, infinity, infinitely wise, staggers belief. The spectacle of the universe as revealed by experience can never have been the ground of religion. It must always have been something in spite of which religion, acquired from a different source, was held. In other words, people have reason. You can't reason your way to a benevolent God from seeing the world. Bixby's trying to talk to me. I have to figure out how to turn Bixby off on this watch. Anyway, Lewis's point here, if you look at the world, and if you have reason, you are not going to arrive at the idea that God is good. That this universe, full of pain and suffering, full of death, could be anything, any way, attributable to a good God. Hence, Pascal's observation in Pensey's, nobody in the Bible reasons to God by nature. In other words, nature plus reason does not equal the Christian God. It would have been an error to reply that our ancestors were ignorant and therefore entertaining pleasing illusions about nature which the progress of science had since dispelled. And actually, if you remember Lewis's point he just made, yeah, well look at mythology. Well mythology has all sorts of gods and they're not that good. That's reasonable. People are trying to account for the world as we know it. Well they're making up stories. So why on earth would you imagine God is good? For centuries, during which all men believed, the nightmare size and emptiness of the universe was already known. And he lays this out in his book The Discarded Image. You will read in some books that the men of the Middle Ages thought that the earth flat and the stars near, but that is a lie. Ptolemy had told them that the earth was a mathematical point without size in relation to the distance of the fixed stars. A distance which one medieval popular text estimated to be 117 million miles. And in times yet earlier, even from the beginning, men have got the same sense of hostile immensity from a more obvious source. To prehistoric man, the neighboring forest must have been infinite enough. And the utterly alien and infest, which we have come to fetch from the thought of cosmic rays and cooling sun, came snuffling and howling nightly to his very doors. The wolf at his door. Certainly, at all periods the pain and waste of human life was equally obvious. Our own religion begins among the Jews, a people squeezed between great warlike empires, continually defeated and led capture. Familiar as Poland or Armenia with the tragic plight of the conquered. And remember, Lewis is writing this in 1940. These are bad years, well, about to be very bad years for England and the Second World War. Very bad years before that for Poland. The Armenian genocide had happened recently. Okay, so those of you who don't know anything about Polish history or the history of Armenia, dark things. And he makes the point, the Jews come up with this idea. And if you know anything about Jewish history, they're always between Egypt and Mesopotamia. And the only time they have any independence at all, and lack of independence basically meant slavery, is when Egypt and Mesopotamia were too dysfunction to dominate and enslave them. That's their story. It is mere nonsense to put pain among the discoveries of science. Lay down this book and reflect for five minutes on the fact that all the great religions were first preached and long practiced within a world without chloroform. People knew pain. Chloroform meaning, well, this is anesthesia for 1940. At all times then, an influence from the course of events in this world to the goodness and wisdom of the Creator, which have been equally, which would have been equally preposterous, it has never been made. Religion has a different origin. And what follows, it must be understood that I am not primarily arguing the truth of Christianity, but describing its origin, a task in my view necessary if we are to put the problem of pain in its right setting. In all developed religions, we find three strands or elements, and in Christianity, one more. The first of these is what Professor Otto, Rudolf Hitler, wrote in his book, The Greatest History of the World. Professor Otto calls the experience of the numinous. Now, again, if you listen to Verbeckis 34, I think he lays this out really well. Well, Lewis is going to lay out the numinous for us too. Those who have not met this term may be introduced to it by the following device. Suppose you were told that there was a tiger in the next room. You would know that you were in danger and you would probably feel fear. You could use a tiger or maybe for you poison gas or maybe for you a man with a gun. Now, in Verbeckis video, he's going to avoid the word terror because of some of its connotations and use the word horror. Now, what Lewis is about to point to now, Mark Vernon in his book notes Lewis's essay, Transpositions, which is actually a really helpful essay in many of these terms that I've been thinking about doing as a video on Lewis's essay, Transpositions. You can find it out there. You can Google it, but it's very helpful in terms of noting often that when we have a world that is too complicated for, in a sense, our emotional or experiential or our vocabulary to account for, you have multiple things being relayed by one term. So we're going to have that in a sense with horror or terror. So if there's a physical danger to you in a room, you experience fear. But if you were told there's a ghost in the next room, and again Verbeckis in his video talks about his experience of The Shining, which is one of the best horror movies you could ever watch. If you were told there's a ghost in the next room, and believe it, you would feel indeed what is also often called fear, but of a different kind. Now recently I spent the night in the Coronado, the Grand Coronado Hotel down in San Diego. And at the Coronado Hotel they have a ghost tour that you can take. The Coronado Hotel has some rooms that are haunted to a high degree. At one point the hotel's owners had a company come in, Ghostbusters if you will, they weren't really Ghostbusters, they were kind of ghost testers. And in one of the rooms they, basically their job was to, well, how much complaining are we going to get from our clients from the ghostly? And basically this company very quietly gave the hotel report, about once an hour there's something. And that wasn't from a psychic, that was from a scientist. About once an hour there's something you can't explain in that room. And if I recall, I think it was the story of a put away mistress from a powerful man in the town who got pregnant and she hung herself in that room. So, the numinous, a ghost. And in fact I came home yesterday and my daughter was watching Winona Earp on Netflix. I didn't know anything about Winona Earp. Winona Earp is another one of these shows like Supernatural. The TV series Supernatural, how many seasons has that thing gone on? Why are so many people so completely fascinated with the demonic and the occult and witchcraft and spirit possession? And most of the people watching this show are like, I don't believe in any of this, but I can't help watch. And Verbecky in his video talks about when you drive past an accident, why does everybody rubber neck? Everybody's told, don't rubber neck, don't rubber neck. And when you're way back in the traffic you're like, oh all those darn rubber neckers, why don't they just keep their eyes forward and keep driving? And then when I get up there, what do I do? I'm drawn to it. There's a ghost in the next room. There's a ghost in the Del Coronado Hotel. And you can go on the internet and Google what room to try and get. And in fact some of those rooms, they're most sought after in terms of people staying because they want to be in there. They want to be scared. We're coming up to Halloween, I saw my first Halloween decorations out. We like that, we're drawn to it. I remember Campus Life used to host an evangelistic project called Scream in the Dark. And as teenagers you'd go through the haunted house and then at the end of it you'd have a come to Jesus talk. And I think about that now and it's just hysterical. But that's what Campus Life used to do. I don't know if they still do it. Scream in the Dark by Campus Life. I remember as a kid I was, ahh! People jump out and grab at you. It's, again, it's the numinous. There's a ghost in the next room. There's a ghost in the Del Coronado Hotel in San Diego. Go stay there and you'll feel it. One of these rooms, once an hour. So the accountant said, It would not be based on the knowledge of danger. Can a ghost hurt you? I don't know. I don't know, that's the whole point. I don't know. I don't know what a ghost can do. Can a ghost hurt you? It's the knowledge of danger. For no one is primarily afraid of what a ghost may do to him. But of the mere fact that it is a ghost. It is uncanny rather than dangerous. And the special kind of fear it excites may be called dread. Capital D. With the uncanny, capital U, one has reached the fringes of the numinous. Just the fringes, these are just the foothills. Now suppose that you were told, there is a mighty spirit in the room, and believe it, and your feeling would then have been even less than the mere fear of danger. But the disturbance would be profound. You would feel wonder and a certain shrinking. A sense of inadequacy to cope with such a visitant and a sense of inadequacy to cope with such a visitant and of prostration before it. An emotion which might be expressed in Shakespeare's words, under it my genius is rebuked. This feeling may be described as awe, exactly what Vervecky says in the video. And the object with which it excites is the numinous. Okay? Now nothing is more certain than man, from an early period began to believe that the universe was haunted by spirits. Professor Otto perhaps too easily, perhaps too easily that from the very first such spirits were regarded with numinous awe. This is impossible to prove for the very good reason that utterances expressed, darn dyslexia. All right, let's try the dyslexic text. Is that supposed to help? Who knows? Oh, where was I? Now I can't find my place. Now nothing is more certain than that man from very early period began to believe that the universe was haunted by spirits. Professor Otto perhaps too easily that from the very first such spirits were regarded with numinous awe. It is impossible to prove for the very good reason that utterances expressing awe from the numinous and utterances expressing fear of danger may use identical language. And again, that go to C.S. Lewis's essay on transpositions to look at how Lewis manages that idea. As we can still say that we are afraid of a ghost or afraid of a rise in prices. It is therefore theoretically possible that there is, that there was a time when men regarded these spirits simply as dangerous and felt towards them just as they felt towards tigers. You got some Owen Barfield banging around in Lewis's head. What is certain is that now at any rate the numinous experience exists and that if we start from ourselves we can trace it a long ways. A modern example may be found if we are not too proud to seek it there in the wind of the willows where rat and mole approach pan on the island. Rat he found, rat he found breath to whisper, shaking. Are you afraid? Afraid of a ghost? Um, rat he found breath to whisper, shaking. Are you afraid? Afraid murmured rat. His eyes shining with unutterable love. Afraid of him? Oh, never, never. And yet, and yet, oh mole, I am afraid. Going back about a century we find copious examples in Wordsworth. Perhaps the finest being that passage in the first book of the Prelude where he describes his experience while rowing on the lake in a stolen boat. Going back further we get a very pure and strong example in Mallory where Galahad began to tremble hard when the deadly, meaning mortal, flesh began to behold the spiritual thing. At the beginning of our era it finds expression in the Apocalypse, that's the book of Revelation, where the writer fell at the feet of the risen Christ as one dead. In pagan literature we find Ovid's picture of the dark grove on the Aventine, of which you would say at a glance Newman in Est. The place is haunted, or there is a presence here, and Virgil gives us the palace of Latinus, awful, horrendum, horror. With woods and sanctity, religione of elder days. A Greek fragment attributed, but improbably to Aeschylus, tells us of earth, sea, and the mountain shaking beneath the dread eye of their maker. And far further back Ezekiel tells us of the rings in his Theophany, that they are so high that they were dreadful. And Jacob, rising from sleep, how dreadful is this place? This is dread, this is awe, this is horror, this is the numinous. We do not know how far back in human history this feeling goes. The earliest men almost certainly believed in things which would excite the feeling in itself, when we believed in them, and it seemed therefore probable that the numinous awe is as old as humanity itself. But our main concern is not with its dates. The important thing is that somehow or other it has come into existence, and it is widespread, and does not disappear from the mind with the growth of knowledge and civilization. Now this awe is not the result of an interference from the visible universe. There is no possibility of arguing from mere danger to the uncanny, still less to the fully numinous. You may say that it seems to you very natural, that early man, being surrounded by real dangers and therefore frightened, should not be able to see the world. But the truth is that the man who is in the world is not the only one. It seems to you very natural, that early man, being surrounded by real dangers and therefore frightened, should invent the uncanny and the numinous. Now again in the video John Vervecky has the nice example that Jonathan Haidt uses a bunch of these things. We have this sense of the uncanny, we have this sense of the inappropriate. I really liked how Vervecky goes into, I forget her name, the Old Testament scholar, who goes into the question of, well, what's with all this unclean stuff? What's a category problem? And I'd probably like to do a video that draws together some of the unclean methodology of the Bible with the numinous. Because what John Vervecky notes, I'm going to make a slide. Again I'm not playing these because the software isn't working right. But at a point in the slide here Vervecky notes this split in sacredness between world food and the world. World view attunement, of which I would say the Mosaic law regarding diet is for. But basically what happens is that there's a formation that happens with this Mosaic law with respect to the Hebrews. And this very unique split that the Hebrews actually manage to transcend between the numinous over here, which is horror, and then world view attunement. Because as Lewis is about to point out in this chapter, it's the Hebrews that bring these together. And these two things are not normally together, which is exactly the point that John Vervecky makes here. I don't know what's out here. Okay. Now this awe is not the result of inference from the visible universe. There is no possibility of arguing from the merely dangerous to the uncanny, still less from the full numinous. You may say that it seems to you very natural that early man being surrounded by real dangers and therefore frightened should invent the uncanny and the numinous. In a sense it is. But let us understand what we mean. We feel it to be natural because, sharing human nature with our remote ancestors, you can imagine yourself reacting to perilous solitudes in the same way. And this reaction is indeed natural, in the sense of it being in accordance with human nature. It is not in the least natural in the sense that the idea of the uncanny or the numinous is already contained in the idea of the dangerous, or that any perception of danger or any dislike of wounds or death, which it may entail, could give the slightest conception of ghostly dread or numinous awe to an intelligence which did not already understand them. Again, transpositions. Lewis makes the point in that essay, see now I wish I had done that transpositions video like I was thinking about, I just didn't have time. Lewis makes this point in transpositions that, well what happens with speaking in tongues, glossolalia in the New Testament? Why can this sometimes be used by the spirit, but then also be used by other things? And Lewis basically makes the point that we human beings are limited, what's that word that verbatim, no it's not adept, it's acceptation. I can't, I got to write that word down and see it because it's when your brain, it's when your brain mechanism does two different things. It's the reason all of this machinery that lets me see, I close my eyes, I'm not using it to process what's coming into my head, but now I'm using it to display an image in my mind, in my imagination. And then someone will put that in the comments section for me. It's in a sense the opposite of that. It's that there's so much in the world that many of our words and many of our emotions and emotional responses have to do double duty because the world is simply too big. And so part of this is what's happening with language with afraid of the numinous and physical threats and even the fear of numinous and physical threats even though Lewis being highly rational says these are very different kinds of experience. These are very different kinds of threat. We don't fully understand in fact what kind of threat the numinous is. There are in nature, there are in the nature of interpretation man gives to the universe or an impression he gets from it and just so no enumeration of the physical qualities of a, let's start this again. Most attempts to explain the numinous presuppose the things that, the thing to be explained as when anthropologists derive it from the fear of the dead without an explanation why dead men, assuredly the least dangerous kind of men, should have attracted the peculiar feeling. In other words, dead men tell no tales. Why are you afraid of dead men? Oh, but we are. Against such attempts, we must insist that dread and awe are in a different dimension from fear. They are in the nature of an interpretation man gives to the universe or an impression he gets from it. And just as no enumeration of the physical qualities of a beautiful object could ever include its beauty, or given the faintest idea, right there you have the mind matter split. In other words, you can try to describe beauty and your description may in fact be beautiful, but the beauty you are describing lives in a sense in an alien place that we haven't managed to golf from the beauty itself. The beauty itself and the description of beauty. Just as looking at the notes of music and experiencing the music seem to live in two different rooms, seem to transmit on two different wavelengths, two different channels. They're parallel sometimes, but we notice the division. There seems in fact to be only two views we can hold about awe. Either it is a mere twist in the human mind corresponding to nothing objective and serving no biological function, yet showing no tendency to disappear from that mind at its fullest development in poet, philosopher, or saint, or else it is a direct experience of the really supernatural to which the name Revelation might be properly given. In other words, what Lewis is saying is that we have eyes to see light, we have ears to hear sound waves, we have touch to feel material surfaces, we have the numinous to experience that which is not within these five senses. Now again if you say that stuff doesn't exist, well then the numinous doesn't exist, but Lewis is making a point. You have a hard time dismissing it while it's all superstition. Okay, people don't act like it is, and in fact basically your argument that it's all superstition, it just doesn't fly. It's never going to win the field. You're always going to lose with it. You really are. The numinous is not the same as morally good, and in fact this is exactly the point that Vervecki makes in his video. The numinous is not the same as morally good, and a man overwhelmed with awe is likely, if left to himself, to think the numinous object beyond good and evil. This brings us to the second strand, or element in religion. All the human beings that history has heard of acknowledge some kind of morality. In other words, we've got the five senses, then we've got this numinous faculty, this ability to sense the numinal, and this uses the same emotional, and because emotional, experiential, phenomenological, as other kinds of fear, but we see via reason that it's very different from fear. Now also we have this thing called morality. Now perhaps this too is a different sense that we have. We have our five senses, we have the numinal sense, and we have the moral sense. All the human beings that history has ever heard of acknowledge some kind of morality. That is, they feel towards certain proposed actions the experiences expressed by the words I ought or I ought not. These experiences resemble in one respect, resemble awe in one respect, namely that they cannot be logically deduced from the environment and physical experiences of the man who undergoes them. And this is in fact the real question of objective morality, which Adam and I often talk about, because you can't see morality. You can see actions and describe them as moral or immoral, but again and again and again you can read Christian Smith's sociology about questioning young people. We think morality is self-evident. When we see it, listen to what people say, it's just wrong. Is it really wrong or is that you say it's wrong? And this is a big part of what we bander about. Well this is wrong. Well how do you know? I just know it, just like the lights are on in this room. How do you know? I just see it. There's traffic on Florin Road. How do you know? I just hear it. That's wrong. How do I know? I just know it. There's a ghost in this room. How do you know? I don't know, but I know it. You can shuffle, I want, and I am forced, and I shall be well advised, and I dare not, as long as you please, without getting out of them the slightest hint of ought and ought not. You can't get to an ought from an is. Okay, that's where this statement comes from. And once again, attempts to resolve the moral experience into something else always presupposes the very thing they are trying to explain, another circular reasoning. On most of these arguments to gain an ought from an is, you're going to find a circle. Well, as when a famous psychoanalyst deduced it from prehistoric parasite killing of a father. If the parasite, killing of your father, produces a sense of guilt, that was because men felt that they ought not to have committed it. If they did not feel so, it could produce no sense of guilt. Well, you just, just circular. They felt guilty because they felt it was wrong. Well, why did they feel it was wrong? They just did. Why do I know the lights are on in this room? I can just see them. Morality, like numinous awe, is a jump. In it, man goes beyond anything that can be given in the facts of experience, and it has one characteristic too remarkable to be ignored. The morality accepted among men may differ, though not at bottom so widely as it can be claimed. Read Lewis's list of the Tao in the appendix to the Abolition of Man. The morality accepted among men may differ, though not at bottom so widely as is often claimed. But they are all agree in the prescribed, they all agree in prescribing a behavior which their adherents fail to practice. All men alike stand condemned, not by alien code of ethics, but by their own, and all men therefore are conscious of guilt. In other words, we make laws. But the funniest thing, you'd think we'd just make laws like politicians make tax code to exclude ourselves from taxation. All of these laws that have a tremendous amount of consistency between them are about things that we regularly violate. The engineers that determine the speed limits on the highway, I betcha they speed. This is what we do. Then we concoct another thing called a justification to try and exclude ourselves from the laws, but we all write laws that we break, and we know it. And Lewis says, this is the strangest thing. The morality accepted among men may differ, although not at bottom so widely as is claimed. But they all agree in prescribing a behavior which their adherents fail to practice. All men alike stand condemned, not by alien codes of ethics, but by their own, and all men therefore are conscious of guilt. The second element in religion, the consciousness not merely of a moral law, but of a moral law at once approved and disobeyed, this consciousness is neither a logical nor an illogical inference from the facts of experience. If we did not bring it to our experience, we could not find it there. It is either an extricable and inexplicable illusion, or else revelation. In other words, it's coming from someplace, and it doesn't seem to be coming from the material world. The moral experience and the numinous experience are so far from being the same that they may exist for quite long periods without establishing a mutual contact. In many forms of paganism, the worship of the gods and the ethical discussions of the philosophers have very little to do with each other. Now, when you talk about, well, just look at, part of the problem is that we moderns have so little interest or appetite in the ancient world. Look at paganism. It's not about morality. There's plenty of relationality, but it's not necessarily about morality. Morality and the numinous are two different channels. That's Lewis's point. And I think that's very much in, I think that's very much this worldview attunement, which is very much about morality and the numinous. These are two different channels. All right. And for much of humanity, they don't cross. The moral experience and the numinous experience are so far from being the same thing that they may exist for quite long periods without establishing a mutual contact. In many forms of paganism, the worship of the gods and the ethical discussions of the philosophers have very little to do with each other. The third stage in religious development arrives when men identify themselves, when the numinous power to which they feel awe is made the guardian of the morality to which they feel obligation. Once again, this may seem to you very natural. What can be more natural than for a savage haunted at once by awe and by guilt to think that the power which haunts him is also the authority which condemns his guilt? And it is indeed natural to humanity, but it is not in the least obvious. The actual behavior of that universe which the numinous haunts bears no resemblance to the behavior which morality demands of us. In other words, the room in the Coronado is not haunted because I took my mistress there and I'm cheating on my wife and a ghost shows up. No, the ghost is just there. It's a different channel. And cheating on your wife, there's another different channel. Actually, my wife and I went to the Coronado, so there. But, you know, two different channels, but that they can be pulled together? Natural. But if you think about it long enough, why? That's Lewis's point. The actual behavior of the universe which the numinous haunts bears no resemblance to the behavior which morality demands of us. The one seems wasteful, ruthless, and unjust. The other enjoins us to the opposite qualities. Nor can the identification of the two be explained as wish fulfillment, for it fulfills no one's wishes. We desire nothing less than to see that the law whose naked authority is already unsupportable armed with the incalculable claims of the numinous. Let me read that sentence again. We desire nothing less than to see that law whose naked authority is already unsupportable armed with the incalculable claims of the numinous. We don't want to see these two things come together. You don't want, oh, be careful little hands what you do, for your father up above is looking down all the time on what you're doing with these hands. In fact, the psalmist, when the psalmist says of the one who says there is no God is pleading the separation of these two. But when you come to Habakkuk, the prophet says, why, oh Lord, or the psalmist, why, oh Lord, are you so far off and the wicked are getting away with everything? The psalmist is pleading for this for their enemies and avoiding this for ourselves. This is exactly what we would imagine and what we know we do. Of all the jumps that humanity takes in its religious history, this is certainly the most surprising. It is not unnatural that many sections of the human race refuse it. Non-moral religion. Have it all the time. In fact, some ways, New Age movement is a non-moral religion. God is not handing down dogma, rights and wrongs. But I don't care how New Agey you are, something comes up that you think is immoral, you're going to complain about it. And because all of this is in the background, you're going to pull the numeral right in as the enforcer of the moral before you know it because you're so used to seeing religions do it now for the last few thousand years. But Lewis makes the point, if we're just making stuff up that we want, we don't want these two things together. It is not natural that many sections of the human race refuse it. Non-moral religion and non-religious morality. There you go. Sam Harris, you got your non-religious morality. You're not going to find this Christian saying atheists are immoral. Well, let's see what Jordan Peterson thinks. Non-moral religion and non-religious morality existed and still exists. Perhaps the only single people as a people. Now look at what John Walton says about the difference between Israelite oracles and oracles from Babylon and Egypt. I've made that point in many of my videos. Perhaps the only single people as a people who took the next step with perfect decision. I mean the Jews, but great individuals in all times and places have also taken it. And also, and only those who have who take it are safe from the obscenities and the barbarities of the un-moralized worship or the cold, sad self-righteousness of sheer moralism. In other words, what Lewis is saying between the lines there is that if you go to the numinous without the morality, it's going to go off the rails into barbarity and just hedonism. If you go to morality without the numinous, you're going to get stuck in just cold moralism. In other words, what Lewis is saying is that for the Jews and Lewis is liking to include others, Lewis says they really do need to go together for each other's sake. In other words, otherwise it's just ghosts. Otherwise it's just moralism. Lewis says when they come together, something special happens. Judged by its fruits, this step is a step towards increased health. And though logic does not compel us to take it, it is hard to resist. Even on paganism and pantheism, morality is always breaking in. Watch Dances with Wolves in Space. Avatar. You get to the climax of the movie and the pantheistic God is fighting for them. He's defending the trees and it's like, ah, yep. See, if you're really a pantheist, you know, it isn't about good and evil because God's everywhere in the stuff. But, you know, what's his head from Titanic? Couldn't hold back. Just had to, couldn't keep to his pantheism in Avatar. Even in paganism and pantheism, morality is always breaking in. And even Stoicism finds itself willy-nilly bowing the knee to God. Once more, it may be madness, a madness congenial to man and oddity and oddly fortunate in its results. Or it may be revelation. And if revelation, then it is the most really and truly in Abraham that all people shall be blessed. For it was the Jews who fully and unambiguously identified the awful presence, capital P, haunting black mountaintops and thunderous clouds and thunder clouds with the righteous Lord who loveth righteousness. The fourth strand, or element in a historical event, there is born among these Jews who claim to be, or to be the son of, or to be one with, or to be something, capital S, which is at once the awful hunter of nature and the giver of the moral law. The claim so shocking, a paradox, that even a horror, which we may easily be lulled into taking too lightly, that only two views of this man are possible. Either he was a raving lunatic, or an unusually abominable type, or else he was and is precisely what he said. See, this is Lewis's famous trilemma, which at this point only had two points. Later, in mere Christianity, it'll have three points. There is no middle way. If the records make the first hypothesis unacceptable, you must submit to the second. And if you do that, all else can be claimed by Christians becomes credible. That this man, having been killed, was yet alive, and that his death, in some manner incomprehensible to human thought, was affected a real change in our relationship with the awful and the righteous Lord, and a change in our favor. To ask whether the universe as we see it looks more like the work of a wise and good creator, or the work of a chance, indifference, or malevolence, is to omit from the outset all the relevant factors in the religious problem. That's how this connects with the beginning of the chapter. Remember, Lewis begins the chapter by saying, if from nature, nature plus reason does not equal a loving God. Why? Nature is too wasteful and too bloody. So then where on earth did the idea of a God is love come from? Comes in Jesus. Well, why? Because Jesus brings the numinous and the moral together and inhabits it perfectly. The Jews and other smart people could put it on the same page and work with it, but Jesus could embody it. Christianity is not the conclusion of a philosophical debate on the origins of the universe. It is a catastrophic historical event following on the long spiritual preparation of humanity which I have described. It is not a system into which we have to fit the awkward fact of pain. It is itself one of the awkward facts that must be fitted into any system we make. In a sense, it creates rather than solves the problem of pain. For pain would be no problem unless, side by side with our daily experience of this painful world, we had received what we think is good assurance that ultimate reality is righteous and loving. The beginning of the problem of pain, his book. And again, when I read, when I listened to the first 40 minutes of Vervecky's episode 34, it's all right there. Lewis worked through this. So I'm going to have to buy John Vervecky a C.S. Lewis anthology because he needs to get reading miracles and he needs to get... I just broke Joey's rule. Joey's great rule in the meetups. You may not assign homework. So not assigning homework. But the problem of pain, episode 34 of Vervecky's awakening from the meaning crisis, the beginning of episode 34, it's exactly what Lewis treats in the beginning of the problem of pain. And Lewis sets it up and says, yeah, these two things don't go together. But when they do come together in theory, well then actually you can have the numinous and you can have the moral without getting out of balance. And then Lewis takes the fourth step and says they actually come together in a person. Now if we think about what we've been talking about personality, why do Christians believe we must be remade in the image of Christ? Why does Paul take the individual of Jesus and turn Jesus into a collective that he calls Christ? It's for this reason that in the life of the Christian, this is to all come together. Now obviously it doesn't come together in our lives ontologically like it comes in Jesus' life, but we are remade in his image so that the numinous and the moral come together. So I was not disappointed in episode 34 and I'm going to listen to the rest of the video and I'm going to enjoy it. So let me know what you think in the comments. See, the software isn't working. I can't stop it.
