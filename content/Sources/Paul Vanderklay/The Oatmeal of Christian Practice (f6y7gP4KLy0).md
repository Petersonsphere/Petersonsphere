 So we haven't spoken unless I've forgotten but I don't forget faces very quickly so why don't you tell me a little bit about yourself. Sure and you're correct so first time speaking. So I'm my name is Joseph based in Southern California San Pedro this is the town some part of LA County so right above Long Beach. Oh okay. Born and raised here 28 years old spent all my time here both my folks are also from the area grandparents on my mother's side were Sicilians and grand folks on my father's side Puerto Rican Mexican backgrounds which is pretty common for the area. Pedro pronounced Pedro as opposed to San Pedro the way that you can tell the townies from the out of towners. Yeah. So Pedro's got plenty of Croatian Italian immigrant families here a lot of them have deep roots and then there's always been a Mexican-American you know contingent in the area so a heavily Catholic plenty of churches a lot of kind of that not traditionalist but but family-oriented type of environment especially in the local elementary schools and preschools and whatnot. Since the population of the town's not too big there's a lot of folks know each other and you're bound to run into someone you know at the store or the gym around town so somewhat of a not quite a small town but distance enough from Los Angeles and and from Long Beach that you get the sense that it's kind of in a realm in between. My father always kind of spoke of it as Pedro's the place where you want to live so that you can visit Los Angeles and not have to spend the night there. We're stones throw from us from a few different few different areas and you know socio-economic realms and it's nice to get a good mix of that down here not have to you know deal with traffic in LA or come over the bridge to Long Beach so but as far as a bit about me I guess that might be relevant. History major educated at UCLA finished in 2013 my first two years schooling I had spent at UC Santa Cruz. Coming out of UCLA I had the opportunity to either carry on with the education to the masters and I'd hope to become a professor or a teacher in some some capacity but by the time I finished school I had so much student debt that it didn't seem feasible for me to want to go you know forward. My folks had always encouraged it and they never shied away from going the extra mile as far as my schooling was concerned or that of my my younger brother you know they were both working crazy hours to put my brother and I through local private Catholic school and then private high schools we actually ended up driving out to LA I went to Loyola High School out on Vance Boulevard out there this was a Jesuit run institution and almost looked like a mini college and in some ways being a high school being a high school student in that environment as a prep school was more difficult than my actual college years. It was a coin I suppose yeah yeah so it paved the way on that end so when I when I finally finished up at UCLA you know I had to make some decisions and it seemed more viable to me to try to find my way into the workforce. My father had worked for for Hughes and then became Boeing for several 27 years I believe total before he retired and they were going through a periodic hiring and lay off waves and at the time the Boeing site out in El Segundo as a satellite production facility out there was undergoing one of the hiring waves so I you know threw my hat in the ring and managed to get an entry-level position working as a liaison between floor level production manufacturing and then some of the functional and operational managers there so a far cry from anything academic and a far cry from anything that I had familiarity with had to learn how to read you know production blueprints drawings and learned about spacecraft integration and satellite systems and the ground support equipment was what I was primarily responsible for for coordinating so to be plucked from my academic environment and put into a you know a manufacturing environment with without the skill sets that I you know that you presumably would need was quite a trial by fire and you know fortunately between my my father still being on the site for the last two or three years actually got to give him work orders at the site which was nice but then got to learn from him and his crew and other folks there who had you know been there longer term was a pretty much a big eye-opening experience for me about just how far removed my academic world was both in terms of the relevance of what I was learning you know for my day-to-day life but also the way in which he did or did not kind of function as a character cultivation site for for myself or for some of my colleagues there was and I've been out of that the university for you know for several years now five six years and I don't other than what I what perhaps in you as well you know may see or hear about echo chambers and universities and things of that nature I've met some folks younger than me who've come through that and they certainly seem to reflect parts of that in their their dispositions but being in the environment surrounded by engineers project managers you know folks who were sometimes it seemed living to work rather than working to live I kind of put me in a spot where I had to reassess what I wanted out of my work life how I could apply anything that I had learned as a history student to my understanding of not so much the work that I was doing but the interplay between folks of different backgrounds that I was meeting at work often folks who were two or three generations you know older than I was I'm on the manufacturing side and the floor level production areas folks who didn't have degrees some of them only had high school diplomas my father being an example and folks just who in general were not entirely concerned with the scale or development of current events or politics or things that appeared you know to me and my my colleagues at school to be all-consuming and you know kind of well how do you get through life if you don't know what's going on overseas or you know what the the latest political intrigue is and so it was a it was a very trying but a very rewarding experience to transition to that environment and once I spent some time there and I'm still employed in aerospace and still in satellite production which I know is very even within our spaces a unique facet of corporate operations and and you know you have different types of folks who work on the air side and folks who work on the space side and tend to run into some different personalities even though the functions can be somewhat similar it was a very it's been a very rewarding experience something that continues to kind of speak to me as a as a character a larger character building enterprise that I'm involved with just beyond something that pays the bills or gives me a means to live and so what drew me into I guess that's a segue and part feel free to you know interrupt on keep going you're doing great so part of what brings me over to you and to the wider community of discourse that's going on on YouTube is when I had come out of school and especially during my my early years as a history major with this emphasis on Western European history we took the full weave just meaning in general my me and my colleagues had full kind of unfettered views of the ups and downs of religious practice and the Catholic Church I had a particular interest in medieval history and the Reformation and Renaissance periods and so to see you know Catholic institutions as a state at the time more so than the kind of the monastic enterprises that they had running on the side that were the theology of things to see the church's evolution over the course of Reformation counter Reformation Renaissance and then on to the current times it was almost a an assumption among folks that I was growing up with that religion was white Catholicism or Christianity in particular was kind of this essentially a non-starter you could go into a room and at any kind of gathering or hang around after class and ask who was a believer who was religious and who wasn't you would it guaranteed you would give maybe one or two hands raised if that you know if folks were even willing to identify it right and as it was something that would be hidden when I was in at UC Santa Cruz for my freshman and sophomore years it was even perhaps more secularized and more irreligious not so not even not even secular but more so somewhat late in hostility among students I was I was with up there a lot of you know left leaning students self-identified communists or self-identified socialists and things of that nature and so in that environment the way that I saw students interacting with themselves and with their their teachers and the way that they were conducting themselves began to rub me the wrong way and I got the sense that that discourse there was going to be limited with the people around me now mind you I never had any issues with staff professors of any in any institution that I was a part of and so I attribute maybe some of that stubbornness on the part of just you know us all being young and and trying to navigate a world that seemed to be easily definable according to what we were learning and and in practice you know once you stepped outside of those definitions was a lot more nuanced and harder to confront but eventually I moved away from Santa Cruz I actually that's when I transferred UCLA in my junior senior years to finish my my undergrad degree and in those environments I kind of doubled down on my my emphasis on Western European history my capstone course was actually a one of those discussion type courses with our professor about the Stalinist purges in the 1950s and kind of the very interesting cycle of secret police organizations and police heads or you know internal security chiefs that would rise and fall according to the winds of whatever party leader had you know paved their way into that position and a lot of the just how fragile everything was even even in those environments for folks who appeared to have plenty of power but were only a word or a look or an act or a handshake away or you know an admission away from losing it all and that was a that discussion course put me into a training mode for debate with other students we had to defend some of the more heinous acts that those police chiefs may have ordered and then we also had to defend them and argue against and so that was an interesting environment as well to see how folks were bringing their ideas into play the reason I bring all of this up was essentially that coming out of out of university the net result of what I had outside of massive student debt was the you know that that the folks I had grown up with who would hear folks like on school with at least who had who had similar educational backgrounds to me who had been you know somewhat socioeconomically leveled by virtue of having their degrees and having gone through a nominally cosmopolitan exposure to different peoples and places and had been in environments that had encouraged free exchange of thought and and and understanding and all the other things that come along with a contemporary liberal arts education I struggled to see how their and it for myself to how I could how that type of awareness or exposure could translate down into the day-to-day operations of our lives and interactions with the people around us outside of the classroom and outside of the institution during my years in college I'd become a pretty strident materialist and I didn't you know not only was I here not only was I non-religious I was like I was more characterized as irreligious if not anti-religious and you get that kind of closeted elitism that comes with being around people who agree with you all the time you know and I would come home to my folks and and people down here in town and or go to family gatherings and things like that and get exposed to what you know what you've called the common religion and which only seemed to vindicate everything that I had felt was was true so it's and I'm there's nothing unique about that story it's probably true I know it's true for for plenty of folks and especially in a being surrounded you know being a part of an Italian family or a Mexican-American family where you've got the falsism wrapped up with your identity beyond a religious practice oh yeah that just becomes a big grounds for familial spats and things like that right and it doesn't really become a source of dialogue there's only there's only one right answer and there's only and only one answer is going to be accepted so plenty plenty of sparring with my with my family members and plenty of sparring with my my parents and you know and once I got into the end of the workforce and started to see things a little bit more detail as far as how folks were actually acting regardless of what may or may not have come out of their mouths or how they identified themselves began to change you know slowly my opinions of it or not my opinions other than my my posture with it my stance you know towards that and when I was finally turned on to 12 rules by Peterson and went through that actually was had the opportunity I saw him speak in Long Beach on one of the tours the bulk of that was devoted to his free exchange of ideas and free speech and so it wasn't totally pertained to any kind of Christian thought but was still was still fruitful and and I found Peterson to be a positive influence for myself as far as jump-starting a process of introspection that eventually pulled me up wouldn't pull me but I drew me away from delving into Peterson or perhaps delving into any of the other contemporary thinkers that are associated or in proximity to him and actually pitched me back towards my roots as a history student and to take Peterson's message about accountability about introspection about self-awareness and continuous self-improvement and then try to pull that back to what I've been interested in as far as the Reformation was concerned Luther and Calvert Calvin and Zwingli that was what actually began a whole train of thought for me about things that I had I had appreciated as a student but I hadn't had the the willingness to take a leap of not so much a leap of faith but a leap of inquiry into that on a deeper level for myself at the time you know in parallel to all of that I was and still am a pretty big heavy metal fan so I was going to show going to concerts and you know I used to have my goatee all grown out pretty large in fact my whole body's covered both arms sleeves chest or tattoos you know some of which are pretty provocative and not necessarily Christian friendly and so if for me to have spent quite a bit of time you know and creative expenditure and contemplative expenditure of my you know my energies and emotions in that environment was very testing for me because I had in my you know kind of in my rationalism approach Peterson as a secular guru for self-improvement and here he was asking me to look not only at at my actions but to also look at what I surrounded myself with and if I could get down to kind of the the meat of those ideologies and and what was the actual output for what I was consuming and it began to trigger in me a very kind of gradual drift away from many of the things that I had identified with heavily over the years I felt like it had brought me down to a point where I brought not brought me down but brought me to a point where it became it was no longer feasible you know tenable for me to listen to to musics or to listen to read articles or be exposed to media that I could simply put away as as background noise it almost over the course of a few weeks it started to seem as if everything mattered everything I was in proximity to or everything I consumed theater did not have an output on my day-to-day behaviors and understanding with people around me understanding myself and I took that very seriously and it I really had to go back and begin to look at to what extent was I merely tolerating some of the extreme ideas or presentations or medias that I was involved with or had embraced to what extent was I rationalizing or justifying some of the more violent or ephemeral things violently you know kind of postured lyrics things like that and and how could I as a as someone who thought that they were a rational human being consider that it was okay for me to be in proximity to these things purely by the grounds that I could write it off as being creative license or exploratory or some kind of you know that it's it's not it's not real it's just songs or it's not real it's just me or its presentation and the more I went to shows and such and the more I got involved with things I began to look at folks that I was around in those communities and try to parse out well if I'm feeling this way have these folks gone all in and have they subsumed those ideas and attitudes in their day-to-day behavior you know how are they treating one another in these environments how are they treating me how are they treating females in these types of male-dominated environments right or male-driven environments and you know to me now it appears to have been a almost a foregone conclusion it was that folks were very much acting the same as perhaps they always had acted I had was around folks who were you know polite as could be and very respectful and gentle people albeit covered in offensive imagery or you know leather vests and that was around folks that were you know appear to have taken things to heart or perhaps had always been hard of heart and treated others disrespectfully and you know with some with contempt and I had to realize that if that if I found that type of behavior to be offensive if I found the communal disrespect or any garden misogyny or the self-destructive tendencies to be to arise an emotional rejection within me that it was up to me to get down to the deeper root of that response I had already known that a certain degree of that as part of your conditioning is you're brought up you know in the environments that you're around and what your family structure is like and the dynamics that are there part of its influenced by environments that you are exposed to in school or at play and then a third component of that is are the things that we pursue independently as part of our hopefully as part of our self-development as individuals or individuals within a larger community where we have responsibilities and I would bring you know my role at work into that as well and so drawing all that back to come back to Peterson and say you know rhetorically you know this the stuff about the room or standing up straight you know that's all those are things that I can see have have practical application day to day but as a you know as a self-identified atheist or or irreligious person I need some I need to get down into those deeper layers to figure out why I feel the way I do about particular particular actions or activities and how I can get my own emotional sphere kind of in check and really make sure that I'm trying to align how I act with what I consume and how I act with what I you know say I believe in at least and how I act with with what I believe or a claim I believe I believe in internally things that aren't localized right and as branching off Peterson exposed me to your channel and to some of the larger dialogues that have been going on there and I'd say that one of the immediate take homes I had from and I'm not particularly you know I haven't been in school for some time and I don't have the same kind of command of concepts that guests on your channel have sometimes and that's okay because everyone's everyone's doing that to some extent that's exactly right you know but to see that it be your ability to speak with folks of different backgrounds to collate that information to try to parse out further points for dialogue or further points for for disagreement respectful disagreeing which is huge further points for refinement you know that to me was one of the most I would say I think the first word that comes to mind is in is enlightening but the real word that I want to use when I hold my my rational self back on that is that it's hard and it is it triggers an emotional response in me that I'm very grateful for and I'm very happy for lack of a better term just to see is present right and to see folks of all shapes and sizes engaging with one another even if it is really because I know in person it's going to be the same to see folks engaged when they're like that is very reassuring and very it's brought about in me I think a willingness and a drive to sit and listen and to hold some of my maybe more characteristic failings which would be probably an impetus to judgment or an impetus to anger to hold those things in check and for that you know thank you and thank all the folks on your channel too for bringing that to someone like myself or to anyone perhaps has felt the same way it's a very it's a very tangible and you know tangible and beautiful thing that has come out of the internet realm which is also often filled with so much negativity for folks but hopefully that gives you enough background to yeah that's wonderful I love your story it's such a cool song you know I grew up in New Jersey and you know where I grew up large Italian population and so I can I can very much an Italian blue collar and then some go off to college and so I can I've I can very much resonate with your story and and your story has so many interesting elements you've got such an interesting life and so congratulations well where you at now in terms of your belief you know do you go to church at all how's how's that going with your parents in terms of where you're at what's what's that look like now so the I have to I guess in my in my current state part of what I've tried to part one of the traits I've tried to reinforce within myself as I re-tap all reopen all these doors I had previously shut right is a strong sense of prudence and caution and I say that not so much as that is that there are things in there that are there to hurt me or damage me but more so in the sense that there is so much not only is there so much at stake from a purely I don't mean stake is in you know damnation or souls but there's so much at stake as far as how I can align myself to better understand myself and the people around me towards a higher conviction moving forward that I'm really trying to take my time with how I go about it and I think the other thing that would draw from my my my experience is that once again going back to to the history student I've been somewhat dancing around the different realms that pertain to perhaps what I find most interesting would be like I guess applied Christianity right or applied practice of belief it's one thing for me to listen to YouTube videos or yourself and conversations with larger concepts and I'm not entirely hip to all of the new jokes about things being meta and stuff like that that you know things that that's a whole separate subculture of dialogue that's going on but more primarily for me of importance is how can I interplay with with that realm to a way where I have an understanding of some of the larger concepts that I that are not tangibles and then how do I bring myself into proximity with Christian communities or Christian practice and I suppose I should back up and say that obviously I've I've made some decisions to align myself back towards a Christian orientation and I guess the the trigger for that or the the basis for that would be that as a history student I've yet to see a more beautiful tale you know or a more beautiful myth in the sense that I think you'll understand how I've done that then the story of Jesus and I've yet to see a more impactful myth or event on the trajectory of the human species and the human organism as a communal entity than Christianity and although I know that there's been plenty of of open hand and closed fist realms to that impact and then I don't try to hide any of that I can't shake the I can't that's something I can't escape you know to see the the ability of Christianity as an experiential process of transcendence for folks who are who've managed to cross the line from our human nature and into something a bit better and to see the even the transformative effects that it has on people of that it's had on people of all tongues and shapes and sizes over the course of human history and also see the impact that it's had in formating an environment in contemporary America where I can express these opinions and we all have this kind of most of us have this most of us who don't spend too much time sitting in front of computers debating on things this moral compass that can generally be agreed or expected upon in daily interactions with strangers regardless of what their beliefs are that's something that to me that that is a it's almost like it's it's like a living artifact of it's like an artifact it's a living light that kind of continues to pull me in that direction and I can't I can't ignore it I can't rationalize it away the attempts to kind of pick it apart from a you know some kind of to pick apart metaphysics or something like that and try to treat it you know to approach it with my old materialist disposition is no longer something that that seems valid to me because after all these years of doing that I now see how much beauty I was I was missing out on and shielding myself from rather than opening myself to because of this misalignment that I feel I have with not only who I was but perhaps where I where I was in society and what my community meant to me and what I meant to them so to go back to the to your question I'm kind of I've been dancing around these facets both on the kind of the metaphysics side and then also with returning to the study of the Reformation the different types of dynamism that have covered Protestant thought in both Europe and in America for you know since since Luther that's been that's been the playground that I've been in you know as of late trying to read and understand a bit more and to see where my my applied and emotional responses to Christian behavior maybe perhaps not belief but but I can't say that I go out into the world and I don't try to meet some if not all as best I can of those of those you know expectations of Christian behavior trying to see where that would where I gravitate towards in that realm and I've I have enough familiarity with Luther and Calvin to understand some of the differences in their not only in their theology but also as far as what that translates to in the day-to-day practice or did translate to in the daily practice for folks back at that time and now in the current time I think and you will know more on this than I would for sure because of how inter-wild communities are now and because Christian practice I think in the US has remains has somewhat at least in my experience that's all I can speak for here is that it has largely transcended denominational boundaries into kind of this very easily consumed oatmeal of Christians you know practice you know and it's all and that and obviously that works for plenty of people because there are participants in it but and it bleeds over into that kind of like ethno communal identity type of Christianity but whereas I'm not so much interested in the all of the distinctions of theology between the different denominations I am interested in how particular personality types or dispositions may feel a pull towards particular denominations you know why do some people become born again why do some folks make choices to return to Catholicism which is I know has been on the rise as of late with some high-profile you know returns to Catholicism or they will call it a return of the policies and but um you know so that's for me that's where I'm kind of trying to tease out both the historic differences the contemporary differences and then what I feel in my personal experience and and how my relationship with with the transcendent that I'm involved with at what point can at what point could I begin to call myself a Christian right at what point do I begin to use that term as an identifier I know plenty of folks will hold for or hope at least for conversion experiences and dramatic you know impacts to that in but you know that some of the more behavioral transformations I've undergone over the past few months none of which were associated with any type of prayer I haven't been inside of a church since probably my high school days I haven't you know I don't read the Bible regularly most of my proximity my exposure to Christian thought and practice is either via the internet and some of these dialogues that go on or the books that I go out on my own to read often which have which are written by theologians or other kind of religiously inclined academics you know how do you bridge that gap when you come from an environment or when you came from an environment that was so bound on having all your ducks in a row before you make the next step and not everyone comes from those environments and so very emotionally driven and impulsive you know we're better for worse with their their forays into faith so that's where I currently am I have a strong interest in Calvinism I have a strong interest in in Methodism both of them that's kind of there are somewhat on different ends of the spectrum right so it's it's me trying to determine what parts of me are those practices or is that community speaking to and then what parts of me are at the core of my experience and what parts have I layered on over the years what parts are what parts are aesthetic what parts are they're all genuine but certainly it's differentiated between these layers of clothing that I've put on and what the actual skin is and after you've spent so much time kind of in a morass of that big Christian oatmeal you really don't know how how it's kind of tough to go back there and really try to figure out yeah I'm sure it takes I know it takes years and sometimes it takes a lifetime for folks so hence my prudence but you know talking to people and and and just as I mentioned earlier just sitting down and listening and externally and internally is my current approach to that I don't know what you think of that if you if you've had similar experiences with folks and well you're obviously a very reflective guy and you think you think things through and you think things through deeply and you've got you know enough to know how much you don't know which is a really important thing and you know it's it's been so interesting watching this journey through so for so many people where so many people who grew up evangelical you know they go into a Roman Catholic or an Orthodox Church and they're like wow so much here so many people who grew up Orthodox and Roman Catholic go into the church they grew up in they're like oh I can just feel it on me I need something else and so there's a lot of and I love your phrase the the oatmeal of Christian practice I oatmeal is just such the such a good image for this melt I mean that the American religious melting pot made oatmeal and and an oatmeal on one hand is can be sort of bland and colorless and just a mixture of everything but also so nutritious and good for you and right and and so what a what a wonderful image well and and and you know well that I mean the I mean this is one of the things I learned from Peterson very well which is that you know in in an action there's so much potential of this I mean every I'm gonna say it better hundreds of years of tradition and lives get distilled down into tiny actions and that's where actions themselves are so potent and so real sometimes when thoughts are so are so abstract and just floating out there so I love I love I love your story and I mean it very much resonates me in terms of you've both got a an academic desire and and an act an academic inclination where you're we thought you're reflective and you're you're making things work in the abstract but you're also you've also got in your life the practical of you know you're not just you're not just thinking you're not just doing the abstract engineering of satellites but you're in the manufacturing because manufacturing is incarnational you take the ideas of engineers and you put them through manufacturing engineers and you make stuff that you make stuff that works and there's something very and so I love the sense of your story where you've both got the heaven in terms of the abstract and the thinking and the thought and you've got and you've still got an appreciation for the concrete and the and the tactile and and that's in your body I had a good friend of mine who passed away last year in this church and he was he was completely tatted up and the funny thing about tattoos is that they they are they are records of moments of your life that are placed indelibly in your skin and so my friend too he had so he would come into church of people he was the only one in church with just was full of tattoos and people would look at him and he'd just say my insides don't match my outsides and because he'd say you know and Brandon especially I'm talking about my friend Brandon he he had so many different permutations in his life he had such an interesting yet tortured yet amazing life and and I I you know I you're you're so articulate and you've got such you know I really like how you very systematically laid so much of yourself out there in this way and how old are you now 28 28 oh you've got a lot of you're gonna keep going and and you've already done a lot in 28 years and I love how your story is you know so I grew up in Patterson which is outside New York and in the the New York metropolitan area is even more ghettoized than Los Angeles which has a degree of it where you know you're a part of a town but this town is in the midst of this huge metropolitan area yet everyone in town is not just geography it's these interrelations and connections and how you said you know you know somebody's from here when they say Pedro not Pedro and and and so I connect with that on so many different levels and I think you're only 28 I think you're going to you're you're just starting out in this journey and I'm glad that you haven't wasted too much of your life in I'm glad let me say it this way I'm glad that you're reconnecting with so many of the deeper things and your your history education and your education at Loyola I mean how many of these high schools how many of these Jesuit high schools named named Loyola aren't there all around the United States that are exactly what you described and so I I just was I'm just fascinated by your story and how you know then you bump into Jordan Jordan Peterson and I can really see how Peterson for you would start tying things together and force you to say hey what am I doing with my time what am I doing with these things that I'm putting into my mind where do I really want to go with this and what are these things connected to so and and so now kind of you know you're turning back and saying okay well well well let's let's let's think again about this this Christianity business I mean it's so you know so like so many just kind of casually threw it away only to later realize I had very little appreciation for what was actually given to me yet your reaction to it given the environment and everything going on was was completely understandable so I I just this has just been you know deeply interesting to me how you just I think you just told your story very very well and I really appreciate it I'm you know I want to talk to you in ten years and find out what these next ten you because you're only 28 so you know really in some ways you go to high school you're still kind of this target of your parents desires you go to college you went to you know UC Santa Cruz I have a son going there now and then UCLA and and there you start to change and then oh gosh you've got the student debt you studied history you know who studies history if they want to get rich you know nobody absolutely and then you wind up in a manufacturing type job and you know the heavy metal and then Peterson it's just awesome story I'm glad that there's there are things there that that resonate with you that's oh yeah and that makes me happy to hear that yeah and and I and and you're doing the work you know you're doing exactly what you need to be doing and I just want to encourage you and say you know keep at it and and keep you know and and then you know I remember I remember when I was in I so I went to I went to Calvin College and then I went to Calvin Seminary I had started Calvin Seminary and to go into the seminary they make you do all these psychological things because they want to make sure that you know you're not going to be a pastor who's also an axe murderer that tends to look bad in the church right so so you do we do all these battery of psychological testing and you talk to you talk to a shrink and all this stuff and and so I had done all my testing and I had my you know my hour with the shrink when he's you know looked at all my testing and and and and the shrink I don't I don't know who he is I can't remember his face at it I remember one thing he said to me that at the time was exactly what I needed to hear maybe he said it to everybody was I needed here at that point but he said to me he said you know what you need to do is you need to make a commitment and stick with it and I had at that point just I had been going going out for a while with the woman who was not my wife and I broke up with her and which she still hasn't forgiven me for but um 31 years of marriage later she still hasn't forgiven me but um and I remember that the psychologist saying you know you need to learn the power of commitment because and at the same time Lou Smedes who was a um was a guiding light in the Christian Reformed Church who had taught at Calvin College and then went to went to teach at Fuller in Pasadena for a number of years he was back at Calvin doing a lecture on commitment on the power of commitment talking about how you know one of how commitments are there these distinctly human decisions that we make that launch a life and um I I remember sitting with the shrink and the shrink was saying you know looking at my life and he's like you know you need to I was at that point unmarried not yet engaged he says you know you need to make a commitment and that was you know it's like because because it's so this life that in our culture we think is the optimal life which is someone who has as many options open as possible in as many areas as possible right and and basically the the wisdom of commitment is exactly the reverse where it says you need to narrow your options and in many ways your story is about you know okay yeah Mexican Italian you don't get much more Catholic than that I mean it's just boom locked in and family tradition all that stuff and and then and then you go you go out to university it's like wide open spaces be whatever you want do whatever you want and then you begin to realize there's a reason we don't live on the Serengeti there's a reason we build these boxes and live in them um and then okay so then the question is what decision will I make in my 20s that I might curse in my 30s and 40s but be especially grateful for in my 50s and 60s if I keep the commitment and um those are those are powerful things so I guess my you know I I want to encourage you because I think you're doing great I love your story I I think that speaking as a pastor I think God is working with you and and I'm really interested to see what he makes of you if I ever get to see that but I I also want to encourage you to think about the power of commitment of saying I'm going to commit to something and in my case it was a it was a marriage and a woman that I committed to and that of course you know I've we've been married for for 31 years now and um and you know that that commitment certainly has shaped my life and brought children into the world and all of those kinds of things but it need not be that type of commitment but the but to make a commitment to something and then see how that you know I remember when I was a kid I went to some thing at a class trip and they had rock candy and I'd never known rock candy at all and and I thought oh rock candy that's amazing and then I somehow figured out we didn't have the internet that you could make rock candy yourself by putting a piece of string in highly charged sugar water and my my I was unsuccessful in my attempt to create rock candy at that point but the the image of the string the string is sort of the commitment and it's all the stuff around that has the possibility to create something that is not necessarily of your making or choosing but something that that God will use and there'll be days that you curse it and days that you're deeply grateful for it but um but it'll be very concrete it'll be tangible it'll be it'll be durable and so I I don't know this has just been I love hearing your story I love seeing what God has made in you and and I'm I'm excited to see what he does with you so it's cool I'm I'm absolutely open to it I think part of the gradual kind of a not not transformation but some of the lot of these gradual changes and if you hadn't you know know me two or three years ago you would never have it would have been unimaginable that I would be having this conversation or speaking and and uh it's a it was I don't know I'm not sure what where the seed was planted you know or at what point there was no dramatic incident or trauma or loss or achievement that you know that that signaled a gradual shedding of some of these old skins I had that I had accumulated or outgrown perhaps but the the physical and the participatory and tangible changes in my interface with other people and and and in the amount of thought I'm giving to my own actions on a day-to-day basis certainly the amount of reflection I now assign to the things that I do and more so than I did before it has been a something that I I really cannot attribute to any anything on in or on this planet and I think that's one of the primary drivers for me to continue to uh to navigate the different paths that are in front of me and continue to be open to further experiences and no longer write off how I felt or you know where well I guess you could call it conscience but but I think it's something even a bit deeper than that um and again I'm not sure where that spark came from um but there I don't get the sense that it can go away uh you know it might it may dim and may it may turn into a flame but there's something that's that perhaps was there all along I just needed to put myself in a position to to experience it or see it um I'm very I'm very excited for that I I I look forward to all the learning that's going to come but more so all of the changes that I think can be that can accompany all of that yeah yeah yeah oh oh that's wonderful that's wonderful any we're just we're running out of time so any last minute questions or anything you wanted to get to that say oh I wanted to talk to paul about this um before we before we wrap up you know I so the only thing I would say uh that I had in my mind was in my encounters with um with the concept of predestination right and and that's that becomes a sticky subject for a lot of folks yeah um but I had always wondered if that aforementioned um if the aforementioned spark that I've kind of been referencing because it's it's it it doesn't have I don't have a route to trace it back to if that is something that folks over the millennia have associated with with a concept of predestination or is that if yeah if there is a if you're if you're going to know god there is no way or if you know or even in proximity that there is no way to escape that knowledge there's no way to to run away from that knowing or the desire to get a better grasp of that knowing is that something that's been associated with that as an as an experiential aspect oh yeah yeah the hound of heaven yeah right poem right and yeah yeah well it's so many so many christians have turned around and said you know I thought I was I thought I was driving this bus and you know I didn't realize that someone had already laid down the road yeah that's that's I think that's very apt and so no that's you know and and these I know people like to fight about these kinds of things but there's a it's it's quite clear that that we have to surrender to christ um and it's all it's always terrifically mysterious why why the work of christ takes in some people and doesn't in others and I think all of those all of those experiences and observations were were baked into the idea of you know what paul and people point to Calvin but you know Calvin's predestination he got from Luther and the Roman Catholics I mean all of the reformers were christened Roman Catholics um that's just how it was and and and predestination wasn't necessarily wasn't necessarily wasn't by any means a an invention by John Calvin and I think it tended to be the the the 17th century some of those 17th century reformed um writers that began to emphasize it in a peculiar way so Calvin Calvin talked about double predestination which is in some ways applying rational logic to the Pauline statements about you know you know calling us from the foundations of the earth so I think I think people in terms of our lives the the doctrine of predestination is a is a is a teaching that is intended to give us comfort when we recognize just how darn flaky we are and that there are days when I'm happily a Christian and other days when I just want to throw the whole thing away and I'm just going to go out there and be the you know be the naughty dog on a chain right you know the the dog that the dog that imagines that if he didn't have this chain he'd be out there catching buses and you know doing whatever but he's on the chain and so all of those imaginations just stay in his head and he gets fed and you know taken care of so um yeah yeah I you know it's it's interesting I you know Lord willing at some point well it will happen the day of you know the day of the consummation that these these long-standing divisions in the church will be healed but you know Calvin was Calvin was deeply I mean he begins the institutes by you know with a letter to the pope so it's got to say something about his heart and and Protestants are protesting certain things and Lord willing there'll be a day when the protests are ended and um and and I think in all already in many ways the the Roman Catholics and the Protestants are are finding ways to appreciate each other and lay down you know lay you know lay down set you know take apart the barricades and begin to embrace each other better part of that also all part of that that oatmeal yeah yeah that oatmeal I love that image that's great that's that thank you for that for for the inside I think it's um it's just one of those that that that concept is just another one of those questions where I have you got my I have my academic disposition and then I have the the a plot the experiential disposition right so trying to not so much reconcile too because I know they can be reconciled it's how do I reconcile those two organically and then produce an organic and sincere output into how I treat other people and how I treat myself yes that's that's where all it to me any any doctrinal or or you know metaphysical or theological um of course a dialogue it's it makes me sad if those conclusions don't trickle down into actions and that's right how we end up treating one another and our loved ones and our and strangers among us and so that's that's really where it all boils down to um and yeah I I would say I in my experience at least what's in a name it's all it's all about the actions and that's that's where I've seen all that that kind of similarity better and worse yeah yeah well when Jesus when Jesus boils everything down you know to the formulation love God with our your heart soul mind and strength and love your neighbor as yourself um you know what that's the that's the that's the primary command Jesus tells us to um love our neighbor all the way up to and including our enemies and that's that's a pretty big group you're you're hard pressed to find someone who isn't included in that group and and therein lies the challenge of the gospel in that you know in Jesus own story his love of his neighbor cost him his life and none of us get out of this world alive anyway so why not why not spend your life on loving your neighbor it's it's hard to think of a more beautiful way to spend a life so great well thank you Joseph this is this has been tremendous I will send you this video and if if you you know if you give me permission then I'll share it on the channel because I think you're you're too good to keep to myself I there's no problems sharing on the channel I appreciate you taking the time to speak with me and thank you again for everything that you're doing with everyone out here videos or otherwise well God bless you and again I'm I I I think God's going to do some really cool things with you so looking forward to that thank you Paul you have a great day God bless you as well you too
