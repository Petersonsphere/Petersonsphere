 Hi, this is Paul. I haven't put out a lot of monologue videos lately. They're stacking up on my hard drive. I've experienced a new thing and my new thing has been hesitation, which is in this area of my life at least a new thing over the last two years. I made a video about the Bible, I made a video about progressive evangelicals, and I had a level of unease about those videos without watching them. Just a sense of, hmmm, pause, do I really want to post that? Now I've had that before with a number of videos and either I erase them so I don't post them at all and can't, or I just post them. Most of the time I just post them and so I don't quite know what's going on inside my heart, but I think part of it is that I, by the nature of my process, I'm not very careful in what I say and that's obviously has its risks for someone in my position. But also a lot of caring. When I talk about people in the progressive evangelical camp, now what do I mean by progressive evangelical? I mean a lot of nuns, not N-U-N-S, but N-O-N-E-S, people that have for one reason or another gotten to the point of saying I can't be a Christian because I find immorality in the Bible or I find too much pain in the world and so I can no longer stay in the church and I am on one hand very drawn to this community and also a tremendous amount of empathy and the desire to engage, but I also know that this is really tricky stuff because many people are sensitive and easily hurt and the last thing I want to do is cause them distress or drive them further away from things that might be able to help them. So what I'm probably going to do is make this video tonight, post this video and over the next week or so I'm going to be taking some vacation time so I won't be posting as many videos coming up or maybe you won't even notice because I'll have a few bankrolls. I had a little conversation with the uber boyos from Ireland and England today and I thought that conversation went really well, I really enjoyed it. I've got a conversation coming up with Neil Shenvy who talks about critical theory and Christianity. I'm very excited about that conversation and I have another appointment with John Verbeckian so we'll be talking some more. So there might be plenty of videos coming out, I don't know, lately I've just been so yeah so I can't really describe it, but I can't seem to not make videos whether or not I post them because for me this is just such a critical part of my ongoing thinking and mulling and to do so out loud just like I always used to blog but my is both so fruitful and also so potentially hazardous. But these these issues that I've got on this slide up right now are are ones that very much dominate my thinking with respect to Christianity or non Christianity and and the deeper the conversation goes between myself, Jonathan Peugeot, Mary Cohen, JP Marceau, our little corner of the internet as as civilian King called it, you know, the more I care for all of these individuals and and perhaps some of that's what I'm feeling because when when I'm talking I got I got up braided by a member of the discord community for my less than generous language and treatment of Brett Weinstein and I noted to him this is on the mass discord video that we did I haven't posted it on my channel just put it on my on the discord the link on the discord but you know part of it is that once once these people become real to me now theoretically I'll I know they're real but once I have a relationship with them that a relationship of come and go a relationship that I care about a personal relationship with John Verveke or Jonathan Peugeot or Mary Cohen now suddenly I'm I'm a lot less I'm a lot less flippant about the kind of the implicit mockery that is a defect of my character that some of you might enjoy my videos for but I have mixed feelings about you know John Verveke is is so is so tremendously considerate and you know is so cautious with with our feelings back and forth in order to encourage and dialogue and I really respect that about him but I'm from New Jersey and sometimes I just want to say John don't worry about my feelings I'm good let's we're good we're good together I trust you you've you've by all means demonstrated to me your your good faith and your so you know we can we can we can play a little rougher that's okay with me but you know can we and and feelings get hurt and something about Christianity says that you know let's let's let's beat apart on ideas but but human beings are image bearers of care for them and love them that's the that's the command that's right at the heart of Christianity love the Lord your God with all your heart so mine is drink and love your neighbor as yourself and your neighbor goes all the way up to and includes your enemies and and these this is something that I that I fail at so anyway I on one of the videos that will probably come out after this but I made before it I talk about Julian Young who is a philosopher that Robert VA had mentioned I've already posted that conversation who's got some books out about Nietzsche and Nietzsche and Heidegger and and and Kierkegaard all people that you know I I feel sometimes embarrassed about my lack of knowledge or my lack of reading about and you know his his books are quite well received quite obviously he did a book on the meaning crisis did a conversation on the meaning crisis which I played in again one of the videos that I made but haven't posted yet and the videos down below here and I linked to it I watched the I watched the end of the video this morning and and noted that he and his interlocutor very much went into what what has become the rather predictable realm in contemporary conversation of what what John Verbeke would call the non theistic not necessarily atheistic but non theistic the the our comfort with the impersonality of the ultimate I would characterize it and and this question for me has been a big thing and if you look at these these these dual isms personal versus impersonal natural versus supernatural the meaning crisis theistic versus non theistic or atheistic and atheistic is not non theistic but these these these contrasts and the questions the either or things that we're wrestling with and and I'm not going to make the move of of you know always using the both and because these distinctions are important and they're they're important in terms of how we live our lives and and where we go with them and lately there's just been so many good conversations Jonathan Peugeot and John Verbeke's conversation so much in that and I know it got a little meta that that some of you said oh you should do a video interpreting both of them but at least not yet I Jonathan Jonathan was aware of this and I think on their next conversation he's gonna try and keep it a little bit more practical more illustration so on and so forth but I I've so enjoyed participating in this little corner of the internet and I found it so enormously fruitful and so gratifying but but I'm still I'm still very interested in these questions of personal impersonal theistic non theistic and and wrestling through them and so deeply grateful to have conversation partners like these both you know even the the people whose videos I mean I got into this whole silly YouTube thing because basically when I was blogging I could just copy and paste quotes from people and interact with them from from books and things but then when I'd see videos it'd be like how can I interact with the videos and even though obviously it's a recording and interacting with something impersonal that isn't conscious of me and can't talk back I in a sense wanted to bring them to life and that's how I you know basically what I did with Jordan Peterson and the work his work that I was thinking through but but now you know we're in a sense transcending beyond the the flat video screen and and building relationships and you know I anticipate meeting Jonathan Peugeot and John Verbecky in the flesh next September and I know some of you said that's nine months away yeah it's nine months away but nine months will go fast but also you know building relationships with with with many of you those of you who came to the Connecticut meetup and those of you who come to the Sacramento meetup and in March probably doing a West Coast tour going from Tucson Arizona all the way up to Vancouver British Columbia having meetups all along the way and conversations and and and one of the things that I'm I'm deeply aware of as I meet more and more of you is how frustrating on this side of heaven our time limitations are because what I find is is so many of you out there such beautiful people so many interesting thoughts so much to give that you know and I simply don't have time to to actually join in communion with you and for me again all of these things are are evidences or witnesses of the the personal nature of God and his creation and the glory of persons rather than just images on a screen or video recordings but the but the glory of real life that we have so so these distinctions the personal the impersonal the natural the supernatural the meaning crisis the theistic non theistic these are these are things that have continued to to dominate my thought now now Mary and JP and John did a video which is two hours long and and there is so much outstanding stuff in that video and it's on Mary's channel and JP's channel they both have fairly small channels with not a lot of subs but I'll put the link down here that's it's on both channels so I should probably put both links on because it's just an outstanding conversation and the the richness of the interchange and the the generosity the honesty the the the openness to explore with each other without defensiveness and and the risk that's involved for this because you know these commitments for all of us arise out of the experience of our lives and they they are they are deeply important to us which is why when people leave churches often they leave angrily or they leave hurt and and as a pastor I'm so aware of of how deep these divides are but the Mary comes right out of the gate and I'll tell you if if you get a chance to talk to Mary you should because you're not going to find too many more people who are as as smart and well read and and you know and caring and sharp if you're going to debate this woman you'd better be ready because you know wow and and again my experience has been there's so many of you out there I mean part of the reason I keep doing conversations with randos and I'm frustrated that I don't always have time and energy to do more and I know many of you complain you can't get a slot but but it's because by by not guiding who I talked to but by having you find me I so often meet the most amazing people and again I think you know that there there has to be a day when when we will sit down and and be able to have conversations at the kind of length that the glory of these individuals deserve and if in fact I am wrong about the nature of the universe and the goodness of God and the and and the glory that he has prepared for us when we've been there 10,000 years bright shining as the Sun we've no less days to sing God's praise than than when we first be begun by rhyming right and and what I mean by that is you know we sing God's praise when we have these conversations for me this is this is part of of Christian worship this is part of Christian work this is part of word gardening in the age of decay but someday when we're not in the age of decay where where we'll have time not limited by the the kinds of time and space that limit us now where where we can sit down and and and I do not believe that in the age to come God somehow flips a switch in our brain and and somehow we know everything I think it's it's much more that we're no longer bound by the kinds of things that bind us in in as the Heideberg catechism calls it this sad world and we can actually continue to explore and enjoy the ultimate unbounded goodness of God and his creation and the the production and enjoyment of the glory he has built in just just goes on and on as CS Lewis says in the in the last battle further up or in boy why am I you can tell there's just been a lot of stuff on my heart that's sort of been clogging my video production and so it's it's all getting poured out kind of serendipitously to y'all but but Mary right out of the gate starts in on this video and you know it's the expiration she doesn't say it this way but the expiration dates on science books come up fast and we're still talking about Augustine and and so we're getting the question about about knowledge and you know I always say politics is of the now and religion is of the always or politics is the weather and religion is the climate and and and there might be a ciencia in the knowledge sense versus these this little fairly narrow thing that we call science now but that was just at Americans right out of the gate with this and I thought oh boy she's she's a formidable woman but the big questions what is real how can we know how then do we live how would we life through the terrible terrible PowerPoint and James K Smith's you know continuing to channel Augustine you know what do we love and that's so important and you know some conversations on Twitter I I retweeted with a typo you know Tom Holland's been on this on this mission to remind us that Christianity and and the work of Jesus Christ whether or not you believe it happened or not has been so deeply formative of the West and in all fairness also of course Plato and and and John Verbeke is helpful in in helping us remember how much neo-platinism comes into Christianity via Augustine and how much Platonism comes into Christianity via the and the ongoing you know tug of war within Christianity what does Athens have to do with Jerusalem and and we're sorting this out and the the challenge of figuring out you know how do we even talk about these things how can we talk about anything as massive as Christianity when it's so much the water that we're swimming in as this Grand River flows through Tim who's who's comes to our meetup and you know Tim and I are working on getting Jonathan out here for something you know maybe around Lent boy that's coming up we got to work on that Tim but but he he likes tweeting from from this one blog from John Strickland and where he says you know we can we can speak of a decline a disorientation of Christendom I like John Strickland's definition Christendom is a civilization without a supporting with a supporting culture that inspires its member to transform the world into a paradise the the paradise thing and the utopianism of that just kind of caught me up and and you think about all of the sub-conversations and and feuds within Christianity and the difference between bearing witness versus the transformational that transformational is something that within even my own Dutch Calvinist subculture were constantly ref selling with between the two sides of Abram Kuyper his the side of the antithesis that drove him out of the the liberal Dutch Church and had him find the in a sense another protesting church the the re-reformed Church of the Netherlands that became the Christian Reformed Church in the United States as opposed to the Reformed Church of America which in some ways is our mother mother church and so these things go back and forth and you know Mark Vernon I really appreciated his his tweet which you know after my retweet of Tom Holland reminding me of the other side I feel worried about this because it suggests Christianity was reduced to a moral system and forgotten the final participation the Barthelian vision of of initial participation and then the the the separation and then the final participation which is something I've done a number of videos about and so often so hard to take all of these ideas and and put them together not not only in in terms of one one one speech package but even one life and in the sense one life one story they fit in more easily together than then you know sentences are just the way that they are but that you know even just trying to talk about Christianity I've bumped into this quite often talking to to Jeff Quackenbush and you know him challenging me on some of these things and you know those challenges are good those challenges are good for me and they forced me to think harder and they forced me to improve my thoughts and you know the book of Proverbs is all about this kind of thing and then of course there's the wines the the Weinstein brothers the you know Brett and Eric and both of them now doing podcasts and and yeah Iron Root was a little upset with my treatment of Brett so Iron Root I'll try to I'll try to be more generous to Brett in the future and try to try to be a better Christian although Jesus could be happy pretty hard on people too you know Brett Brett wanting to have some kind of sustainable humanism that can afford the kinds of the kinds of goodness that that the vast majority of us Christian and non Christian and theist and non theist and atheist can agree about that that these are good things and and I'm always wrestling with trying to figure out well how do we know the good where does the good come from what in fact is the good and and a rule just sent me a an email with some links and some time stamps which are really helpful because the amount of emails and video recommendations I get is more than I have time in the day you know about Eric Eric pushing Sam Harris on on some questions of agency and the video that I'll probably post after this one where you know I think a lot about God number one and God number two and and if God number one and God number two sort of get out of balance in our thinking in our theology God number two sort of expands and then becomes unbelievable becomes sort of magical thinking becomes an old man in the sky and God number one disappears and so it seems to fall apart and then God number one reemerges I think CS Lewis when he says that that pantheism is sort of base religion for humanity and only gets Lewis of course the Platonist only gets only we only arise above it when we when we get to Christianity and Plato that's that's Lewis of course a good friend of mine once you know sort of cursed out Lewis for his Platonism and I didn't know enough Lewis or no enough Plato at that point to appreciate but my good friend Harry who was the editor of Christian Courier sort of the CRC rag and coming out of Ontario you know a man who died a number of years ago and whose voice on I miss so much because I learned so much from them but you know it's it almost seems like we have to once again understand that the God number one aspect the God number one nature of God before we can really appreciate and worship the God number two-ness of God but but but on one hand not have God be either a a morally corrupt or a personally impotent deity whose no I think we will always have qualms about the morality and the wisdom of trusting God I think that's built into us from from from the fall of our first parents and Adam and Eve it's it's that ubiquitous we always will have trust issues with God but but I think it's the imbalance of God number one and God number two where this goes and so and so what you tend to have with with Brett and Eric is you know Eric the the mogul who's who's sort of the brain behind the scenes how can we manage the economy and and manage the structures so that kind of he's sort of the the benevolent elitist who who wants to although he'd probably be offended by that I don't but but that that's so how often how he comes across in his podcast that here we have to we have to rig this thing so it all works out well and Brett sort of coming at it from the the biological thing and and Jordan Peterson with his anxieties about Western civilization and and and all of this is in play another another video that I that that's that one of you sent me some some courses from Yale on the Old Testament and boy that caught my interest it's like I want to watch all of this and but of course I haven't anywhere near a chance to but but Christine Hayes introduces to me the work of of Kaufman and his his meta-define is meta-divine the meta- divine realm which is his different differentiation between paganism and the Bible the quote this doesn't get taken down with Kaufman's characterization of what he calls pagan religion that's the term that he uses the fundamental idea of pagan religion he says and I quote the idea that there exists a realm of being prior to the gods and above them upon which they depend and whose decrees even they must obey the meta-divine realm this is the realm of supreme and ultimate power and it transcends the deities all right now where I'm gonna go with this is I think this distinction that Kaufman sets up is very much in play today because a lot of what I hear from non theism from say Karl in the comment section as though talking about emergence is very much strikes me as this that the fundamental nature of the universe is the fundamental nature of the universe is impersonal it's just up there and so in mythology then from this the gods are born but but the the relationship between the meta-divine realm and the gods and then humanity on down the hierarchy on down the line that that relationship then then fundamentally changes what the universe is is it God or the meta-divine realm a little bit later in this in this video she'll make it quite clear that that God is not a meta-divine realm God is good and and the whether there is or isn't a meta-divine realm whether you conceptualize the the basis of the universe and and as from a personal God who has a will and and desires or a meta-divine realm which is just sort of impersonal but but it's it out of this emerges the gods out of this emerges you know consciousness and all of this there's a fundamental difference between those two between those two perspectives in terms of what comes out and especially in terms of how we must respond to the universe as individuals as persons as people with wills and you know I saw there was some of this in in the in the video with Julian Young who's talking about Heidegger and I haven't had a chance yet to listen to John Verbeke's Heidegger post that he just put out but I'm very interested in that and I should catch up with that before I have my conversation with John next week and although I might not post it away so so strong you might have to wait because I'm I'll be dribbling them out probably if I post at all you know he get some of you are gonna be in terror he's gonna stop making videos probably not it can't seem to help myself but but Heidegger's view of the horizon which is sort of the horizon of our language and the horizon of our knowledge and we can't know beyond that horizon and and I think that's that there's a lot of truth to that and and the very interesting part of of Jonathan Peugeot and John Verbeke's conversation where Peugeot makes the point that you go up you go up you go up it's person person person now now do you get above it in a sense where there's no personhood but but then when you come back down it's got to be person person person person person again and that's similar to the the the argument that I made with with John Verbeke and the video that I made with him where I signed I had the PowerPoint and had him critique and argument I had and and I wasn't really making an ontological claim about metadivine realm versus theistic God but more in in a sense up until the horizons that we can see and the way that we need to act and and there's a sense in which well how must we live well this is the way we are wired to live it'd be like telling me that I need to use a language I need to use the language everything's been in religion before it gets in philosophy or anything else I was gonna say you need to use the language of the angels and the Pentecostals would be jumping on me yeah you can do that just you know bang look at my conversation with with with Paul Antleiter and and with Scotland Morrison but but these are these are the issues that we're facing in all of this and then you know non theism or eighth and again they're not the same thing non theism and atheism as as what I've seen sort of a return to this idea of the of the metadivine realm that that there's somehow this realm up there out of which things emerge now of course a rule had who I talked to a number of weeks ago you know he had no patience for this emergence argument he says this is this is you know emergence is sort he didn't say it this way but maybe he said this on Twitter I don't remember but it's almost sort of like magical thinking because it's sort of like me with a chemistry set when I was a kid I got all these little bottles with chemicals I don't know what they do I'm gonna pour them all in and hope that something good comes out of it and because if you can't explain the processes from which things emerge and of course that's people are really working on that but but the argument of emergence without the argument of emergence without bringing with it demonstrable and repeatable in other words scientific arguments and if John's not trying to do this John's got more of a co a co a convergent argument let's say with his with his argument and he's he's been very clear about these is that you know then you're just you've just got another form of magic you've just got another form of supernatural you've just got another form of of divinity because somehow these things happen you don't have divinity but you say well these things come about and but they come about without purpose but then you have to ask the question of well what is where does the meta divine realm come from just like question where does God come from okay I understand that where does the meta divine realm come from and and and why does it have the kinds of potential that these things all emerge from it I mean these are terribly difficult questions now we live in a post-enlightenment nature in a in a realm without meta agents this is the secular realm as as much as laws and forces and so in a sense that the meta divine realm just we just get rid of there's just no more meta persons up there and so we have a meta divine realm which is physics and the Big Bang and all of the potential that seemed to yield to life somehow that was in it and there's just no there's no there's no agency there's no persons there's no purpose there's no providence there's no inevitability it's just it's mindless potential that thankfully for us has yielded stuff that looks like purpose or stuff that we get fooled into imagining has purpose except if we're really disciplined and we say yeah no you know blind Darwinian process here until of course emergence affords relevance realization by which we can in fact move with purpose but these are tremendously hard questions and and so you can see by by the nature I guess I can increasingly see by the nature of of how this is set up that of course we have a meaning crisis that we took out purpose from the beginning and now we we want to have it go all the way down but we've already stipulated that it can't so so we somehow we have to sort of like building buildings in California where we want to put them down as far as we can but we know that the ground is going to shake and we know that the forests are going to burn and we know that when this when the winter rains come there will be mudslides but let's not have a meaning crisis and so in a sense what we have is this great trade-off and and we have more power with science to address you know short-term common problems that we can all agree on it you know the big three that you've all Harari mentions in his books you know war famine and plague and and and what we've enjoyed at least since the end of the of the Second World War have been limited wars and reduction of war and reduction of famine and reduction of plague and and all of that is really good and these are goods that we can agree on but we don't know how well these goods scale and whether we're just in a sense in sort of a Jonathan Peugeot sense you know order continues to build and and the margins will have their day and so if you look at sign of a kind of a Peugeotian universe you always have what you have in in Middle Ages thinking you can find this quite ably talked about in Charles Taylor a secular age you have these these marginal areas so you're going to have lent but you have Mardi Gras and and so there's a balance between lent and Mardi Gras and so you will have fasting and you will have order and you will have a center and you will have a fringe and when the fringe comes to the center you'll have chaos all over until at some point orders restored I mean Jonathan very much has that type of very much has has those types of systems which are of course in themselves again in some ways in the mental imaginary natural systems and what we generally mean by the word natural systems and what we generally mean by the word natural is is that they go on their own now Peter Kreeft in a in a piece that was originally this is a transcript from Eric Metaxas did a Socrates in the city event I hope nobody got triggered by the mention of Eric Metaxas Eric Metaxas did a I think it should be a goal of us not to be triggered maybe that sounds very Buddhist of me but Eric Metaxas hosted a Socrates in the city event had Peter Kreeft said someone so those who know Dutch say you ought to at least say it like a Dutchman so Peter Kreeft for those of you who don't know maybe a little self-indulgence here grew up in in northern New Jersey and in the Dutch Calvinist subculture ghetto there although he was on the RCA side of the line and he he went on to he went to Eastern Christian and my alum my my alma mater and Calvin College my alma mater and broke the hearts of of Calvin College philosophers by going to the Roman Catholic Church but Peter Kreeft has been out there and he he angers some people because of his his political stances but I like a lot of what he has to read and so he did this event with with Eric Metaxas Socrates in the city and I'll just read the first few paragraphs because I think it I think it it relates to this well from somebody who's not suffered very much you're supposed to receive some wisdom about suffering that's that's irony all right but let's plunge in there are three kinds of evil that I want to talk about suffering death and sin what we fear most most of the time is suffering then death then sin exactly the opposite of what it should be that's that's all right I'll start with a problem with suffering to live is to suffer was the Buddha's first noble truth the truth that he thought was the most obvious and indisputable truth of life Jordan Peterson thinks that too the data on which any quasi scientific theory of human life must be erected pain is the most obvious problem in the world this is no less true today for now that our civilization has succeeded in conquering half of humanity's physical pains by anesthetics and medical technology and bookie boards it has also doubled humanity's spiritual pains depression despair divorce when I first got into this years ago I didn't have the word language meaning crisis but when he says it that way we're talking about the meaning crisis baby which is um but also doubled humanity's spiritual pains depression despair divorce which is more painful than death other betrayals loneliness emptiness meaninglessness an existential vacuum Victor Frankl says quoting Nietzsche a man can endure almost any how if only he has a why the how is the circumstances including the suffering the why is a purpose and a meaning that is not a theory it is an observation Frankl is a scientist he observed this to be true in the laboratory of Auschwitz the corollary of this truth is that if we do not have a purpose or a meaning then we cannot endure any suffering that's inconvenient our culture seems to have made of the Faustian bargain of giving up a better why for a better how giving up meaning for comfort we've conquered the world of pain but we've lost our soul our meaning our hope our purpose and that's why the physical pains that remain the only half as bad in quantity compared with those of our ancestors are twice as bad in quality twice as unendurable twice without the meaning to surround them the end result is that though the pains are less we fear them and we feel them more it's like the difference between childbirth and abortion to use a quantitative analogy for something that is not quantitative the birth has a thousand pains but a thousand transcendent Lee meaningful joys the abortion has only a dozen pains but no joys suppose we took our bat we took back our bad barden bar bargain like Sydney Carton in a Tale of Two Cities and basing Christ life like martyrdom for his beloved Lucy wisely exchanging the whole of his material goods his hitherto meaningless life for the pain of the guillotine and the pleasure of a spiritual good moral meaning including the hope for heaven that was such an excellent bargain that Carl that Carton said of it is a far far better thing that I do than I have ever done before or like Jim Elliot the missionary martyr of Ecuador who realized the same truth when he said to those who called him a fool for risking his life to preach to the savage Alcas that he is no fool to give up what he cannot keep for what he cannot ever lose both Sydney Carton and Jim Elliot were echoing the wisdom of a man who said what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul did any human being in all of human history ever utter a single more practical sentence than that one yet though spiritual pain is deeper than physical pain physical kit physical pain can be very deep and very troublesome its troublesome this is not only physical it dominates the spirit of everyone except those who are both the strongest and the sweetest of humanity pain is like a jealous tyrant with a whip commanding all our attention at every moment shouting look at me look at me it's hard to mediate or calculate or compose music or poetry or discover even great scientific breakthroughs when you're being whipped or burned or cut and cut all over your nervous system now there are two obvious solutions to physical pain no and yes no tries to abolish it and this is quite natural and good and the modern West is very successful at doing that yes yes tries to somehow accept pain but change our inner attitude towards it this is the answer of the ancient East especially Hinduism and Buddhism and in the ancient West of stoicism which is kind of like non mystical Buddhism the modern West praise grant me the courage to change what can be changed the ancient East praise grant me the serenity to accept what cannot be changed and both pray for the wisdom to know the difference but the modern West has not succeeded in conquering all pains by technology instead it has created an artificial protective bubble that is empty of them of most of the physical pains of life that are that are pre technological ancestors had to cope with but we found the bubble almost also empty of meaning and thus spiritually painful we've abolished 90% of pain and also abolished 90% of heroism and courage this is a you know pre Jordan Peterson but making the same point which are no longer needed in the bubble each decade we get a little closer to brave new world that is to the greatest pain of all the pain of an absolutely meaningless life to quote one of America's greatest philosophers Yogi Berra yes we can recognize wisdom even though the evil empire even among the evil empire he's talking about the Yankees see see this shows Peter Crave's betrayal of his New Jersey roots by going over to the dark side which is the Red Sox but anyway I return if this world was perfect it wouldn't be Yogi Berra is right right on brave new world by the way if you haven't read it you must read is a prophecy if the West's problem is failure I think the East's problem is success for some people at least that is for the spiritual athletes who practice Raja yoga or Nana yoga the Buddhist noble eightfold path pain is abolished by abolishing its root desire when there are no desires left there are no frustrations left Hindu or Buddhist yoga can indeed succeed in killing off the desires the true Buddhist does overcome all pain but also all pleasure all fear but also all hope all hate but also all love all misery but also all joy this is a remarkable achievement but it's worth the but is it worth the price of the abolition the abolition of half our human nature it looks like spiritual euthanasia killing the patient the desires to cure the disease which is pain I think therefore this is a misunderstanding I must confess that the Buddhists that I have met have surprised me and impressed me with their peaceful alertness and spiritual aliveness they certainly are not visit they certainly are not spiritually dead but they have also surprised me with the inadequacy of their philosophy their explanations I must be as offensively honest with the East as I have been with the West though and protest that the freedom of the freedom from pain is not worth the price I will take the bitter with the sweet thank you the depth with the height better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all but from the moment of our birth human nature including two incomparable elements the presence of pain and the demand of its absence we all have pain and we all hate pain the modern secular West tries to get the satisfaction the ancient mystical East tries to get rid of the desires the West tries to conquer the pain the East tries to conquer the fear of our pain our common problem is that our desires are greater than our satisfactions the West tries to change the disequation by bringing satisfactions up to the level of desires of course this never works while the East seeks the same end by opposite means that bringing desires down to or even below the level of satisfaction and this does work but only to the practiced yogin or the enlightened Buddhist East and West both give us roads for escaping the problem they're opposite roads but they both escape the disproportionate between the disproportion between desire and satisfaction which is the formula for pain or suffering what is the Christian alternative CS Lewis says in the problem of pain Christ came not to free us from our pains but to transform them into his that's the answer in one sentence and then he goes on to unpack it so the meaning crisis and again I think the meaning crisis as as craved makes the point of is in some ways the result of our success we have we it's an exchange we exchange the explanations and the power and the abilities for the different kind of pain and so can we escape or awaken from them and there are there again we are back to this question of personal impersonal theist non-theist um purposeful process versus blind emergence that has it have we been the fortunate inheritors of it or would we be better off being the dinosaurs and the dogs that know not the end to which they inevitably will be brought so in this wonderful conversation between John Vervecke and and Mary Cohen and and JP Barso they get into a point where they really get into it and where they really start to get into in a very practical way the kinds of questions that I bring and so I want to jump into the discussion there okay it was about some program to help some some um child refugees you know and I was looking at it and I and as I was looking at it I found that there was this odd little hard place in my heart which is strange for me I mean I'm a grandmother I have nine grandkids I'm not I'm not I'm not immune to the cuteness and the vulnerability of children but I found there was this little hard place this little stone in my heart and when I interrogated it it came with a thought which was kind of like well these are these are Muslim children and yes they might be very cute little kids and they might be in all kinds of trouble now but you know 25 years from now they may be trying to kill your grandkids yeah I thought that's quite the that's quite the snakey little thought you know and so when I had that thought um you know before I tell you how I handled it if I came to you and I said here's my situation I have this thought and this I do not want to be the person with this hard with this hardness in my heart and I do not I do not want to be believing this thought or I do not want to be um taking my stance toward my fellow human beings based on a thought that see Mary is working out Jesus command to love her enemies and and she in that little hard part in her heart she knows and now anyone who imagines that loving your enemy somehow somehow in the short term means you won't get hurt or your enemy won't kill you doesn't understand the story of Jesus because he loves his enemies as they're killing him and and that's again why the resurrection makes Christianity responsible and without the resurrection the the entire equation with which we engage the very brutal decisions of this world changes and so and so Mary's doing this work in her heart and and and so she's in a sense saying John if if if if you were a pastor how would you handle this would you offer me in as a practice or as a as to overcome that so first of all I mean I I'd have to ask you some more questions uh because there's situations that I mean where that is now now before John answers here and they're getting into a bunch of stuff that I've you know basically into because of this video you know what Peter Boghossian and and Peter Lindsay have written a book on how to have impossible conversations and I should really pursue this more with them but I'm just way too ADHD and impulsive when it comes to planning I mean if I were going to make a career out of this I would need a manager because obviously I anyway context matters in these questions because right away we we we usually turn to technique and and now Mary hasn't asked this question and so it's you know I'm not saying anything you know against John in this but but someone could rightly come to Mary and say Mary know that that little hard spot in your heart is exactly what it should be you should not have you should not have you should not have compassion on those little children and a little bit later I'm going to talk about a tweet that I talk about in my other two videos where someone from the who's very much have the journey of the progressive evangelical or the progressive ex-evangelical you know read numbers 31 where where God basically commands the ban on the Midianites and he reads this in horror and he says what kind of book would portray God this way or what kind of God would do that you know you're right Mary the thing in your heart is correct those those little children are going to grow up may grow up to be terrorists someday this humanism that you have is irresponsible and and not really affordable in a world of dog eat dog and in a Darwinian planet it's not affordable now now John may offer effective effective ways to to to use psychotechnologies to help Mary be softer towards these children but the question of whether or not she should be that's a very different conversation and that's at the level at which in some ways Brett and Eric Weinstein want to engage but it's exactly that level that's problematic now now I should shut up and let them talk very intense so there are people that get very intrusive thoughts on a on a regular basis and they be sort of OCD or various things like that and they they need specific kinds of therapeutic invention intervention I'm not one of those people okay so let's say this is this is more this is not sort of driven by any kind of pathology so Mary wants to be a good person and and now Tom Holland's point is that in the West thanks to Christianity thanks to the and I know this is debated by the guy Tom Holland was debating an unbelievable and and and and Jeff Quackenbush and maybe others you know I would say that this definition of a good person is our definition because of Christianity and because of Jesus Christ and because of his crucifixion on the cross that is now a good person and unlike the people that Tom Holland saw those those ISIS characters who were who were crucifying their enemies and and saying this is what God wants Christians now come and say no we will follow Jesus we will allow ourselves to be crucified and we will extend hospitality to these Muslim children even though in the end they might by the by virtue of maybe the failings of our Christian society grow up in our culture and become terrorists with passports from our country these are the stakes right and what Christianity says is we will not only embrace that risk but if that in fact becomes an actuality we will shoulder it because of Jesus resurrection as if Mary would come to me as a pastor that's probably the answer I would give her and and she'd say but I need some more psychological things I might then turn to John's answer here and say here are some psycho technologies and some manners in which you can do this now I don't by this answer I don't mean to back John into a corner okay or dismiss him and and if if I would ask John to account for this kind of self-donating love that might put your entire civilization at risk because these these are the kinds of complex equations that we are working beneath the surface maybe unintentionally psychologically bringing to these very difficult problems nevertheless what I would say is well we should pay attention to some of the techniques that work in the more pressing case because there's good reason to believe they might be also efficacious in a less pressing case and so I would talk about the kinds of techniques that are used within a therapeutic setting to make us aware of I hope I hope this doesn't seem tiresome to you but the way in which we're self-deceptive the way in which our cognition is biased the way in which we leap to conclusions the way we are we are easily capable of my side bias which is sounds to me like an instance of you know my side in my group were right and the anchoring bias is what I'm familiar with and therefore it should be defended with a question so and and and that's that's interesting because it's so often in this world my side versus your side and it was homo sapiens side versus neanderthal side and homo sapiens win so there's and there's lots of practices you can do so one practice that I talked about is active open-mindedness I do this myself I spend I think every I started every day by reading about a particular bias and then I I try to look through throughout the day and then at the end of the day I journal about it try to note where where I noticed it try to see evidence where I might not have noticed it in terms of how things turned out and what he's such a better person than I am he really is I don't mean that I mean that seriously he's working much better on this than I am you know happens is you train yourself over time to to become aware of these biases and then you can actively counteract them as you become more and more sensitive to them and as you become aware of them earlier and on in your processing so for example today I noticed as I was reflecting on something that I was doing the confirmation bias I was only looking for information that confirmed my belief because I was sensitive to it and maybe that's what this whole video is my confirmation bias I've been practicing mindfulness I could step back and say ah okay now what I'm going to do is specifically direct myself to look for some disconfirming evidence you can do the same and I and to bring it to something that's more existentially similar to what you talk about um the past few days I've been doing I do I do these like cycles right kind of thing I've been noticing you know that the tendencies towards narcissism and egocentrism and then trying to step back um and actively counteract them and what happens over time and this is you know this is something held by the Buddhist traditions and the Taoist tradition and historic traditions is you get that change you get that change in which um that that tendency is ameliorated I would never claim any kind of perfectionism um that's I think I think the proper adjective for that is ridiculous um it's true but do that's very true that's why I'm a Calvinist have I seen in my own life amelioration of a hard heartedness yes have other people independently of me talking about this reported that in their observations of me yes and do we have scientific experimental evidence that these techniques are efficacious yeah um and so um that helps a lot I mean other things I do that help when you're meditating you're triggering the insula and you get it more active and the insula is not only how you intercept your own body it's how you pick up on other people's mental states so if you intercept them or if you do the meditation and you enhance your insula you'll pick up you'll enhance your ability to pick up on other people's uh mental states and so that also helps because it's harder to dismiss somebody in a categorical fashion when you can pick up on their uh internal life so those are some of the things I would recommend is that answering your question yeah I was wondering what kind of like set of practices there would be for someone dealing with that now I'll tell you what I did so when I saw this in my heart um I recognized it because I'm coming from a Christian perspective of course so I so I recognized it as a sin sure all right and so I took my stand on a promise in the Bible where God says that a humble and contrite heart he will not spurn so I you know I'm sorry I I recognize that I have this hardness in my heart and then it's wrong and then I also mentioned to God that he had promised that he would remove hearts of stone and give us a heart of flesh it's a another promise in the Bible and I said I don't know how to get this stone out of my heart but and um and so I turned it over to him and I also made the mental resolution that the next time I go to confession that I would confess it and then I left it you know I didn't dwell on it I didn't try to enter into conversation or argument with him because I really didn't even know how a few days later I think it may have been as soon as 48 within the next 48 hours I happened to be looking in um on YouTube and there was a YouTube video about um Muslims having dreams of Jesus and a phenomenon that I had no idea that it was going on yeah this is this is quite an interesting I've I've spoken with missionaries from within my tradition who have had powerful encounters with these prayer and dream ministries it's there the stories are quite something but it was that there's this phenomenon all throughout the Middle East in a number of countries of many many thousands of Muslims having a dream of Jesus appearing to them and saying he loves them and that and I'm not saying that they instantly you know convert or anything like that in some cases when they have the dream they also have a dream of Jesus accompanied by a person and and he'll say this is a friend of mine and then the Muslim will be walking on the street and they'll see this Christian person and say you were in my dream and they'll they'll tell the person about the dream and it's such a prevalent phenomenon that in one of the countries I think it might be Egypt a Christian ministry just put up a bill board and said have you had a dream of men and white we can answer your questions it's that it's that it's happening that much and I I read that I mean I I listened to that video about that and what was really pertinent to me that relevant was the Jesus was saying to them beloved them saying to them beloved them well they were Muslim it wasn't like Jesus was saying convert become a Christian and I'll love you you know and that just hearing the few testimonies and and then you know knowing that that is going on that completely changed my heart I mean that removed that hardness in my heart completely so this is because you asked about what what are the what like what are we phenomenologically experiencing that that kind of warrants the you know the ontological sense that we're dealing with a person you know with a personal being at the at the ground of being now I should say that as a pastor stories like this aren't common but there are plenty of instances I mean just look at the conversation I had with with Scotland Morrison with the two people independently coming to him with these same three visions now someone could say oh that's coincidence and these are common you know but I'll tell you as a pastor you hear stories that that you say they're not repeatable they're not scientific but you hear them and you say wow that that's that that makes me think that the world is more purposeful than we imagine and I would say it's that kind of experience now let's go carefully then what that means okay because I want to understand what so I mean for example I didn't talk about it but I could have but because you've heard me allude to it you know I also take the perspective of you know what would Socrates do or what would Marcus Aurelius or try to do that and internalizing the sage as I argued in the series is a pervasive practice that you do in order to and there's work by you Vargos but showing that if you do that sort of third person perspective on your on your problems it will trigger an insight and insights are not things we we do they're things that we undergo right they happen to us right we can we can we can afford them we can afford them they're not random we can we can alter the probabilities of their occurrence like practice mindfulness practice the view from above practice taking the third person perspective but there's definitely an aspect in which it self-organizes and has a life of its own so is the part of the phenomenology that goes beyond that the sense that you're being spoken to I'm trying to get the phenomenology because I didn't have a sense that I was being spoken to what it was is you know I I don't know if if I would necessarily have even noticed or clicked on that video if I hadn't already like made that prayer and been made aware of me too and the YouTube algorithms that work use your language to transcend myself in that area sure so I can see a lot of what you're saying about relevance you know finding something salient you know in that event but but I didn't cause the Muslims to have the drink dreams do you know so so there's two aspects to that let me respond to the first the fact that I know I'm going to be writing for my journal at the end of the day makes me sensitize and notice things I wouldn't notice in a similar way I think that to your prayer again I don't mean any disrespect to them but I'm trying to say in that in that same way that your prayer primed you right and and so you have the insight knowing so I'll be walking along and I'll have the insight and go ah there's and it's because I know I'm going to be writing at the end of the day in my journal and that that has that effect so I think I think I have something very analogous to that now the other point about the event that that that comes down I guess to an area I don't know what we'll be able to talk about it very much I'd like to and I'll be as open and as honest I can about it and I know you will too I mean that's that's where perhaps you see the miraculous and I I see sort of cultural things happening and the fact that you know I mean you could give a you know one example I'm not claiming this is the right example I'm just using it as an example you know you know Jung talked about how you know he's having all of these dreams of blood drenching the earth before the war and it you know in the Muslim world is in is in a kind of contest with Christianity and perhaps those dreams are again you know trying to portend a needed shift in cultural cognition about the relationship between Islam and Christianity and and you know right there it's this is just such a wonderful example because you know it's it's not dissimilar to in the first century anybody who is following the the culture war of first century Judea would be aware that there's very strong likelihood of a of a of a climactic struggle between you know Jews who very much wanted to be free of the Roman Empire and the Roman Empire that very much wanted to keep its vassals in place especially along the very important route by which grain went from Egypt to Rome so you know John's example is a good one I mean to these are these are experienced in these are not they're not distinguishable experiences because and this gets into philosophy of you know of Kant let's say where that I play in the video that I already played in the video that I recorded but might post after this one because I feel better about posting this one than I do about the other one we'll see if the other one ever sees the light of day but the fact that we you know when I'm having a dream in my head it's a dream in my head and I how am I supposed to know what's beyond my head and but then when you see all of these people having the same dreams well is it in the culture is it is it is it because you know Christians have been so sneaky and saying yeah Islam is all about submission but Jesus is love and and you know we can't answer these questions and again if I look at um if I if I pull the actually I'm gonna kindle uh the miracles book not not from not CS Lewis's miracles but the the big two volume set of miracles maybe I'll remember it put in the show notes of the of the New Testament scholar he married an African woman and and he just he just catalogs miracles ancient miracles modern miracles he goes into the philosophy and the theology of miracles just a huge treatment of miracles but things happen that human beings instinctively say this is beyond me this is beyond coincidence and now the amazing Randy can come along and debunk everything but but of course you have the problem that he can't debunk everything because he's one person and so his horizons are limited and so here we are as human beings and we have to frame all this experience some way and in a sense secularity says it's better for us to frame it in terms of maybe a medical a meta divine impersonal thing that is you know through emanation or through emergence created what appears to for us to be personality and agency and all of this and and of course theism comes along and says no the better framing is that and and so perhaps what we will know in 500 or a thousand years is the answer to this question but all of us will be dead by then but right now what we are doing in these conversations is working through these issues with amazing with great slowness but amazing granularity that that via human beings and real lives and real stories are are working them out through time and so that hundreds of years ago we hundreds of years from now we may have these answers better than we have them now and this is a view of of all of this stuff these ideas working through us all the way down in history answering this question because you know john verveke and i are going to shake hands or or embrace when we meet each other and in thunder bay lord willing because that's what the bible teaches me to say and um you know i you know i'm i'm a theist and i believe in jesus and i've got this whole system and he's a non-theist and he has that whole system but but we will you know to the degree that we can be friends via this kind of relationship that we have now you know we're working all of this stuff out and this stuff has been working through billions and billions of relationships through time and i would say by the grace of god we have documentation and and and all of this and we're working through this now but the fundamental question we you know each of us in some ways have to answer it for ourselves and that answer gets worked out in how we live but but but none of us are able to to know in the sense of that we know other things and even using that language is so embedded um because i would say well i've got the unions on me with with carl jung i know there is a god right there on tv um and and as a christian i would say i know that my redeemer lives and but but here we are in the midst of this and and so on one hand i just want to illustrate that but i also want to point out the the beauty of of of this video of john and mary and jp and now me butting my big nose in um and saying isn't isn't aren't we blessed that we can do this and not kill each other and not assassinate each other's characters and and and know that there are sticking points and tensions and disagreements but but not being disagreeable about our disagreements and that's a beautiful thing i'm not claiming that's the case you you accept that i'm claiming that that's that's a and that's an explanation and of course i could see i'm quite happy with that kind of explanation and say oh yeah that makes good sense to me and you know i i see you i understand why young had the dreams he had and and you know young of course i didn't know anything about young until jordan peterson and of course if i talk to my friend skip you know maybe i can't really get young straight through jordan peterson but you know young helped you know bridge some gaps for me in terms of you know how this might work and um and you know psychology has been helpful but yeah well you all know my i understand that and for me pardon me do i do i what sorry you can you can finish your your sentence and i'll i was just gonna say for me the the fact that we if we take it that a large part of our adaptive cognition and i argue for this very explicitly is pre-egoic and it's self-organizing okay pre-egoic that means well somewhat you can probably say what it means better than i can but in other words it's happening back there and we're going to experience it as maybe that little voice because of course socrates had the little voice and and socrates listened to his his i'll say diamond so i don't say demon because then it's like but we all have this and if you look at you look at philip fast who sometimes on the freddy and paul show he'll keep talking about the little voice and and when he sees somebody he's got a jesus sign in his pocket and the little voice says give them a jesus sign and he follows that little voice and and amazing things happen around philip fast and some of you might look at him and say ah what you know there's this crazy guy with a big beard at christmas and the jesus sign and and all of his stories and but but you know okay so but i've philip fast is also a guy who will give you the shirt off his back they might not want to see that but he will give you the shirt off his back and he will fix your kitchen and he will build a ramp for you and he will he will help you because that's what's been formed in him and then what we can do is sort of activate it and trigger it and i think that's kind of what young was talking but that's not completely unfair right because young's model of the conscious of the of the psyche is a self-organizing dynamical system and many people have commented on that right i see that you know there's whole aspects of self-organization that are going on and trying to inform and constrain my conscious awareness and i see that on a continuum with what i'm doing with my journal right it's it's it's it's activating self-organizing processes that and and and what i see i see that on a continuum with me too and and but then there's this point at which you know there's this point at which it's no longer a shaping putting constraints on my salience landscape so i notice things that i've been blind to in the past and so that's how i would respond to that yeah you know we're kind of making a the thing is i suspect is that in our western metaphysics there is a large gap between let's say the cultural explanation which you just gave john and then there's a large gap to the miraculous explanation right and i'm not using that term dismissively mary understands what i hope yeah but i mean i i i agree that at least in western metaphysics the gap is fairly clear that you need to that there are clearly jumps there uh do you see that okay jp always has his jumps at his bridges it's kind of shoots and ladders with jp i love it cultural explanation is insufficient but i'm this is tentative but i think that the sorts of metaphysics which you can see especially in eastern Christianity and which jonathan talks about a lot in this channel seems to really collapse the two where uh there is a and and that was really interesting because if you look at my second conversation with jonathan peugeot where we got into demons and angels i i i didn't fully understand jonathan when we were having that conversation i do much better now i mean and and that's still fraught because on a at least a weekly basis i'll i'll have conversations with people about angels and demons and and what is a principality and to what degree is it both and and boy these are these are hard questions but i really appreciate jp's point here and of course jonathan's work a clear hierarchy of beings uh and let's see the fact that the ground of being could manifest itself through let's say the the cultural layer would not uh yeah the fact that god would manifest itself at the cultural layer and and that's very similar to say her Herman Boving's which is Herman Boving is one of the theologians that's part of my tradition Herman Boving's organic inspiration of scripture it's it's not a a dictation mode that your god dictated people but it's it's organic it comes through history and and i think in many ways you know that this Herman Boving set me up to be able to understand Jordan Peterson and and not have some of these dichotomies and and and feel comfortable with the both and without necessarily excluding the miraculous but you know that that these are the these are these are what we're dealing with here that's in the dreams of multiple people will not take away the causality of the ground of being from doing this you see where i'm trying to get at i do i mean and i mean you and i've talked about this and i talked about it recently with Jonathan yeah and that's why i was mentioning the Regina about trying now the sound levels that's not my fault right now okay i i have many sound problems but that's sound level issues on the video need to get beyond either metaphysics of emergence or metaphysics of emanation um and that's and and what uh what i what i'm picking up between um i mean Jonathan Peugeot and John Vervecky is i i see them not only articulating their perspectives but i also see them hearing each other and and so i can understand why Jonathan Peugeot's hierarchies make John Vervecky a little nervous with his you know opponent all his opponent stuff and his emergence and emanation and you know it's very interesting watching these two deal with the the vertical and the horizontal and i've mentioned before that one of the things that i learned years ago when i was going through the gospel of Luke and i was working through Joel Green's big commentary when i was first becoming aware of the way that status works in scripture is that Jesus is constantly working this and this and then for him to be the cross to become the symbol of him it's it's incredible i also talked about i tried to give us a steel man version of the argument that you and Mary have made um thank you for that well of course you guys are doing good work you should only be treated with respect i mean that that's these canadians they're so polite if you're from new jersey we wouldn't be half this nice that's how it should be we're all fallible i know i'm making mistakes so let's just keep working together um i mean we criticize each other we're disagreeing right now but that's what we're doing it in a way that's helpful i guess i guess the issue is um and you you presented this to me and um so i'll just i'll just bring it back up in case people haven't seen that discussion you presented that you know we're going to get down to some fundamental presuppositions and then it becomes not so much a question of epistemic decidability it becomes more a question of existential risk so i don't i'm not i'm not taking as much existential risk i mean there's other ways in which i take more risks than you do but so and some people have commented on that but i understand what you were trying to convey because you're positing a commitment to entities i'm not positing if you'll allow me that i'm trying to speak as mutually as possible um and therefore that's riskier for you uh but you think it also it's kind of a and i don't mean this explicitly it's kind of an extension of pascals wager it's a greater risk but it also has a chance for sort of greater and i don't mean hereafter rewards it has a chance for greater you argued uh you know existential reward right right now right now um and i don't have i don't have any uh i don't have any like way of like denying that i mean because of what i've committed myself to in this dialogue that our metaphysics are are self-correcting and i've stated this clearly and explicitly and i don't know people i'm not sure people quite get it i clearly do not have an argument that forecloses on the possibility of christianity being able to reformulate itself in a way that addresses the meaning crisis yeah i've explicitly said i do not have such an argument and i would deeply suspect anybody who claims to have such an argument that's why i don't like some of the claims of the new radius what i do claim is right um there's overwhelming evidence that many people because if we shift off of epistemic to existential then this becomes relevant right jp many people do not find that a viable alternative for them we're not talking epistemically now we're talking about the kinds of existential risk because existential risks are not just an epistemic concern they have to do with how you've been traumatized what kind of courage you have what's your character all that kind of stuff comes into play now when we're talking about an existential factor and for many many people the empirical evidence is clear they they establish religions and that the miraculous interpretation are not viable to them so that and and and this you know this is perhaps the source of of my recent um timidity and reluctance to to really wade into the progressive evangelical or the progressive post-evangelical or just the post evangelical or perhaps just the nuns in that you know i can i can make any philosophical argument i want but my arguments are deeply based on pastoral experience and the the kinds of reluctances and fears that they have are based on the same stuff that i deal with as pastor and and tim keller in his book on pain and suffering which i think is his best book at the beginning of the book he has to make a choice does he want to deal with the problem of evil as a philosophical problem or as a pastoral problem and and he distinguishes those two quite clearly and he follows avan plantenga in that because avan plantega makes the point that the problem of evil really isn't a philosophical problem the problem of evil is a pastoral problem what do i mean by that i mean it's in the same level that we're making judgments about the miraculous or the non-miraculous we're also making judgments about whether i will identify as as a a believer in jesus christ or a particular religion and and these you know people make these decisions based on all sorts of things and whether they believe in the miraculous or whether they have a bias that says miracles don't happen and and so so the church has the church has made a lot of these identifications and i understand the reasons for those and the church has enforced them in terms of their institutions and how they work and i very much understood understand those and and in fact practice them within my my life as a pastor but we ought to also understand what those rules are for and and when they are functioning and and how they function and and create spaces and this is my work with john van donk and my meetups create spaces where these rules aren't functioning where people can speak the truth and have process it's in some ways analogous to the the pastor's office or the the therapist's office to work through these things and so we have philosophy but but people are people are what this is all about that's my response my response is i can't foreclose i do not claim to foreclose it's possible that jonathan and paul and you and mary will succeed and you will reformulate christianity in a way that makes it much more efficacious for dealing with the meaning crisis i also acknowledge repeatedly that people can return to christianity and find meaning within that i've always acknowledged that as well but i'm saying that if we if we say that this final decision is one of existential risk rather than epistemic argument then then it becomes the fact that for many if we move to existential risk for many people it's not viable it's not viable and and this is something that you know i've probably kvetched at before but i again it's something we really need to take seriously and and i think in some ways this is um there's someone out there who really wants me to engage in the calvinist arminian feud and i really don't want to but but that doesn't mean i'm going to any god worth worshiping who is smart enough to make the universe can think through these things and will manage all of these questions better than we ever will and at the heart of christianity is a posture where we trust this god come what may and that's the kind of decision that gets baked into extending hospitality to little muslim children extending hospitality to little muslim children and even places in the bible where like numbers 31 where it seems very ugly and it and it relies on a posture that says following jesus um yeah he will preach he will assert he will even condemn whitewashed tombs um broods of vipers jesus can jesus can use strong language but jesus will also be generous towards those that his disciples and also the religious leaders didn't think generosity should be extended and it will cost jesus life and the church in its best moments finds ways to do that and the church often suffers for that because so often these people are also placed oppositionally and we are fortunate to live in a the united states and canada when then these decisions don't come to most of us most of the time like they do in other times and places in the world and how much of that how much of that existential risk that exists is a result of protestantism versus being a result of of apostolic obviously include the catholic and orthodox altogether is mary picking a fight with the protestants the apostolic christianity uh you know there are people in my parish coming into the church right now there is someone on the discord server that that paul set up that's becoming interested in catholicism coming into the church right now and i'm like i look at that and my mind is blown because with the current condition of the church and the hierarchy and the corruption that is so obvious to anybody with two eyeballs it's it's incredible to me that these people are open-minded enough to look at the church and not have those things blind them to to what's there i know because i'm in it but i mean if i was outside right now i don't know that i would be dipping my toe in that water so um so having said all that though i've you can come to my church mary i'll have you do you wonder how much of this this looking at christianity as not viable is really a result of the kind of truncated christianity that we have in the west of protestantism not only truncated but deeply fragmented yeah that too and i'd like to see that joe really helps with that you really help with that i think in your project you know the there are all kinds of issues as mary is raising and for a long time people were just leaving the church like crazy and i think that the yeah the presence of people like you or uh george peterson as well people who are trying to come in discussion with christianity from a secular uh approach people who can talk the scientific language really allows christians to clarify on some points to uh yeah to maybe give away some stuff to gain some of the stuff to reformulate better some of their positions and we can see just in this corner of the internet of how many people are coming back to church because of this joint discussion and i can see really in in the discussions we've been having john i can tell you that this has really sharpened my metaphysics quite a lot and much quicker than if you hadn't been there there's really a good open processing that is going on between see the naturalism which you're putting forth and i see it as more and more viable and at the same time i see the strengthening my christianity uh really conjurantly and i hope that you're also getting some things out of our discussions and totally and watch the whole video it's it's it's an amazing two hours and they went two hours that warmed my heart and and i haven't seen the whole thing so i again i have a bad habit of recommending videos that i haven't watched the whole thing so whenever you hear a recommendation of mine i might be recommending it based on a little single part of it i i am that unreliable but um you know so we have the language differences of the god and the unconscious that we talked about with you and we have the difference of public authority and this is a big one and this is a big part of our politics but but what sort of what democracy does is it outsources it to the zeitgeist which sort of encourages the play of propaganda which gives us some of the things that we see and this is very large very long this is a tweet that's in both of the last two videos and maybe the source of so much of my angst because sack writer or mike who's a former pastor and former you know used to go to church another tweet he has where he's asking for an affirming church because he he and his wife think well maybe we should go back to church because he used to be a pastor and and but but you know so much stuff happened that he can't stand it anymore and he reads the bible and he reads numbers 31 and and and here god does this um you know get your head around these facts god commanded sex slavery god commanded slaughter of children and there's his blog post and and then i also such a bad pastor i said he also drowned the world except one family i'd suggest this whole way of arguing over god and morality has a significant frame problem but of course mike isn't going to watch my videos nor is he going to come to my jordan peterson meetup because jordan peterson's name is on it and that'll you know i'm not gonna go to anything that's associated with jordan peterson people there i might bump into a republican this is very large and very long and jordan peterson's darwinian bible authority versus brett weinstein's obsolete wisdom and jesus as christianity's progressive interpretive key you know see tom holland and deling pod that that's sort of secularism and christianity sort of flow together and you know confessional christianity stops but secularism takes over the world in many ways not fully not completely and and now we're wrestling through the questions of secularism and and and these issues get beyond the heideggerian horizon and then that for me again as a pastor i love mary's question how to live and you know why relate to a personal god and i ran through that and john was so gracious and and at one point in the video i kind of you know expressed delight because i thought he's really gonna come back at me with something and i thought yeah now let's get into it um that's just my freesian jersey jewish nature i guess so anyway um how to live because that's in very petersonian language it comes down to we have to act as if we believe in something or act as if something is real and and and that's what we do so yeah there's a picture of my father in the thumbnail and um i gotta wrap this video up but i when i was home with my mother we talked about my father died in 2013 and um we talked about the fact that if my father were alive today he would so love this he would be watching every video he would be i'd have him talking to people um you know he would he would so love this because his heart was his heart was for the people of paterson and his heart was for anybody who would come his way who needed help and that's how he lived his life and that was this was last one of the last pictures taken of him it was at a conference and and and they were singing and a friend of mine turned around and snapped this picture of him because he had so much joy it's so much joy on his face and he was enjoying worship so much and of course in my christian language he was we didn't know it then but he was in the foothills of his heavenly reward and he was about to go further up and further in and whereas you know i wish you were here with us he's not and my christianity affords me this this this this melancholic joy as c.s lewis would um we call it this and such that i don't believe that my father is gone and i don't believe that just pieces of him lie in in my imagination and that of my mother and that of my family and the the thousands of people whose lives he touched but that um my father's story continues and in the resurrection will continue even further and so if if i must be on one of these sides of this divide that i started with i will i will stay on the side of a personal god and i will believe that my savior lives and he rose from the grave and and for me the amount of meaning that this affords me and maybe i'm not being fair because you know i had i had wonderful parents and i've had amazing church experiences for the most part and and life has been good to me and and it affords me a belief in a belief in a god that that gave his life for his enemies and it affords me the the incentive the incentive to express agape love even to people that don't deserve it even though i do it poorly and and i think happy am i for what i've been given so so far i feel good about this video maybe i'll post it tomorrow and then maybe i'll have the courage to post the other ones so i i almost never say this and i should thank you for those of you who are supporting me on patreon that's an amazing thing some of you send me money on paypal other support living stones church and we're gonna have to redesign that whole thing because our current vendor doesn't really work well but thank you for those who spend the time to watch these videos again it's it's so humbling and gratifying when i talk to somebody and they say boy you've really helped me you've really helped me and and they might be thinking about god they might not be there they but honestly just the fact that anybody listens to these videos amazes me and and the fact that you'll reach out to me and send me emails and some of you even support me financially i'm it's just god is good and his love endures forever and that's what i believe you
