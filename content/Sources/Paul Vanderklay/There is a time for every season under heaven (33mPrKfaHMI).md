 Hi, this is Paul. This is part of my Rough Draft to Sunday series where basically I walk through and edit my sermon on the way to Sunday. If you have comments leave them in the comment section. Comments are welcome because this is part of feedback and just me practicing and walking through and getting part of my sermon prep on the way to Sunday. So here goes. Suicide is a very strange thing. We are we are creatures with a strong will to live. We love stories where where suicide is we love stories where people fight with incredible determination to stay alive and and then suicide is this practice where people just kind of throw away their life. I read this book a couple of years ago and found it interesting and moving. I learned a lot from it in terms of the the history and of suicide and the philosophies against it. Humanity has taken this practice in a lot of different in a lot of different ways. Part of what we deal today with in terms of our culture is is the question of suicide and circumstance and you know in some cultures suicide is honorable in certain circumstances and in fact in some cultures it is the honorable thing to do in some circumstances and in other cultures suicide is shameful and and always shameful and and in fact in and in fact sinful in in many cultures because life is a gift and it doesn't it isn't fundamentally yours. And so if you throw it away you are basically you're basically robbing someone else of what is theirs, which is your life. Now obviously in our culture where we imagine we belong to ourselves there's people have different takes on this and lately there's been a lot of movement in the culture and politics and law about doctor assisted suicide and and if you begin from the premise that our life is our own then we then we have every right to throw it away or or do what we want with it and that's kind of the rationale behind doctor assisted suicide also because we we as a culture greatly believe in eliminating pain then pain is for our culture a legitimate reason to take one's life and end the pain. Now there's obviously a lot behind that that that I'm not going to go into. Now in our culture suicide is mostly considered a tragedy. I think it's associated with often with unmet often with unmet circumstantial desire. You know you'll have stories of unrequited love or a financial collapse or a loss of status or reputation. It's also associated with with the disease of depression and and depression is a funny disease because it is in some ways also connected with circumstance and I think that the dance we do in our culture with respect to that disease is interesting because on one hand we all acknowledge that it's circumstantial but on the other we want to very quickly wrap around it a mantle of of biological medical precision that imagines that with the right pills or the right antidepressants then we can somehow make ourselves happy even though as a culture we are gripped by a fascination with happiness and an imagination that says we can use cars and romantic love and houses and puppies and and and status and achievement all to create happiness and so you have to and in fact we have laws against let's say illicit forms of chemical happiness such as getting lost in in heroin or something or cocaine or or something like this so so it's it's interesting that when we for example with the with the suicide of Robin Williams a few years ago we tend to default to a medical a medical a shared common Trial in the streets medical diagnosis, and I think there's something deep within us that expresses the the Ambiguity and the fear that we have as a culture about this through that now now a few years ago there were a number of articles in In the press about suicides in Palo Alto, California now I live in Northern California Palo Alto has a reputation for of course being the home of Silicon Valley of Google of the of the amazing of the amazing accumulation of wealth and power that has happened in just a generation and and here were a number of articles about how the children of the wealthy and the newly wealthy and the newly powerful were were struggling in this one article and and Psychologic and psychology today goes into you know problem with rich kids and and talks about how they How they suffer from distress? substance abuse depression anxiety eating disorders cheating stealing and You know often higher rates of suicide and there in fact was kind of an epidemic of suicide that was going on in a particular Palo Alto high school and and and this just begs the question that we have as a culture about Suicide and not only suicide, but but what we are and who we are There's there's been similar articles about suicides on Wall Street Not just when you know the mythical jumping from the buildings when the market collapsed way back in the 20s but but even in the heyday of the market a couple of years ago there was a Suicide of a prominent figure on Wall Street a man who seemed to have everything together He had you know all kinds of money and he had status and he had power and he had a lovely family and and How could this man who had everything throw it all away and again we jumped to a medical diagnosis Which could be a very fair thing in any particular circumstance but again, I think part of the reason we jumped to that medical diagnosis is that Deep behind the reasons we often jump to medical diagnoses is that it separates us from from Separates that circumstance from ourself and we imagine that here this person has a disease which I don't have Therefore I'm safe from the anxiety and and and perhaps the Existential tension that drove this person to this calamity of taking their own life Now if you if you flip the script a little bit and look at situations where people Radically lose control of their lives such as some of the some of the writings that came out of the of the Holocaust of the Holocaust Ailey Vesell and his in his book night Which if you've never read it this these are not books that you want to read if you are in fact Clinically prone to depression they are they are powerful and They tear at your soul and here he tells the the story of a rabbi He he was old and bent his lips constantly trembling He had always he was always praying in the block at work in the ranks He recited entire pages of the Talmud arguing with himself asking and answering himself endless questions One day he said to me it's over God is no longer with us and and Vesell poor Poor Akiba droomer if only he could have kept his faith in God if only he could have considered his suffering a divine test He would not have been swept away by the selection But as soon as he felt the first chinks in his faith He lost all incentive to fight and open the door to death and it's incredible here How the Holocaust just tries the faith of these You know of these individuals and and how Vesell one of the things that comes out from so many of these of These memoirs from the Holocaust is is how the separation of who lives and dies is the one who can Continue to maintain their belief Victor Frankl is is perhaps the the greatest example of this someone who was who was obviously taken He had a he had a fiance and and then I caught this from From his you know from his book about about meaning the most painful part of beatings is the insult which they imply which which is such a dramatic statement because it in in our materialist culture where we like to imagine that You know this body is the is the primary thing about us that that we are fundamentally animals you know we are we are the strangest kind of animal you could imagine because as as Victor Frankl says and and when I read this and in the book I was just struck by it because it was so true and so right that that on on one hand sure caused me physical pain, but People and this I think holds up to the suicide conversation. It's the insult. It's the it's the existential angst and and Struggle that that is that is us Now I'm setting us up here to get into the book of Ecclesiastes It's it's one of the most haunting books in the Old Testament the words of the teacher son of David king of Jerusalem Meaningless meaningless says the teacher utterly meaningless everything is meaningless now now this Havel this this word that's translating meaningless if you check English Bibles You'll see all kinds of different ways to try to translate it vanity There's as you know if you if you have if you know If you know more than one language or at least even bits of more than one language There are often words in one language that can't fully or adequately be expressed by a single word or even a group of words And in another language You know I think of for the Dutch but out or has Alec is another you know word for the Dutch You know the Spanish have theirs and this this word meaningless is is So if you look at at how it's used in the in the Hebrew scriptures It's often you know connected with worthless idols Gilgamesh in the Gilgamesh epic the word you know or a connection to this word as has Gilgamesh saying very similar things about it He's using this word with respect to all of his dramatic Accomplishments and how they are breath how they are wind and and so in one hand you have the sense of wind and breath Which which in one moment may be? Completely life-giving and essential in the next moment seems utterly useless and passing and and with this connotation associated with idolatry you've also got a Conception of deceptive and illusory and and something which takes you down a wrong path and so the book of Ecclesiastes is is set up as As You know as a son of David a king in Jerusalem And as we keep reading someone who has someone who has everything and he looks over his life And he says meaningless meaningless and sometimes as I read the book of Ecclesiastes You know I start to wonder was was this person just just depressed is this an existential crisis What do people gain from all their labors at which they toil under the Sun generations come in generations go But the earth remains forever the Sun rises and the Sun sets and hurries back to where it rises The wind blows to the south and turns to the north round and round it goes ever returning to its course All streams flow into the sea at the sea is never full to the place where the streams come from there They return again all things are wearisome more than one can say the eye never has enough of seeing know the ear It's full of hearing what has been again. What has been will be again What has been done will be done again. There is nothing new under the Sun Is there anything of which one can say look there is something new it was here already long ago It was here before our time No one remembers the former generations and even those yet to come will not be remembered by those who follow them I the teacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem I applied my mind to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under the heavens What a heavy burden God has laid on mankind I've seen all things that are done under the Sun all of them are meaningless a chasing after the wind What is crooked cannot be straightened what is lacking cannot be counted I say to myself look I have increased in wisdom more than anyone who has ruled over Jerusalem before me I've experienced much wisdom and knowledge then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom and also to madness and folly But I learned that this too is a chasing after the wind for with much wisdom comes much sorrow The more knowledge the more grief I said to myself come now I will test you with pleasure to find out what is good But that also proved to be meaningless laughter I said is madness and and yet what does pleasure accomplish I tried cheering myself with wine and embracing folly My mind still guided me with wisdom I love this how the teacher on one hand is trying everything but another sense of his person is back looking at himself saying Okay, will wine do it and I find this this so Captures who we are and how we watch ourselves and how we examine this life and how we try to suck wisdom out of it I Wanted to see what was good for people to do under the heavens during the few days of their life now you might notice again The repetition of under the heavens and I think this I've mentioned before that in some ways the the Hebrew scriptures are the most the most secular part of the scriptures and that you know We don't default to an afterlife as as we usually do in the Christian context And I'll get into that a little bit later in the sermon, but but but this is a picture of strictly under heavens This is a picture of a phenomenology about how we look at the world about how we experience life This is a picture of of in a such us as animals watching ourselves as animals Watching ourselves as something higher than the animals but understanding our animal nature. This is this is very Augustinian. I Undertook I undertook great projects. I built houses for myself and planted vineyards I made gardens and parks and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them I made reservoirs to water groves of flourishing trees I bought male and female slaves and had other slaves who were born in my house I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me I am asked silver and gold for myself and the treasure of kings and provinces I acquired male and female singers and a harem as well the delights of a man's heart I became greater by far and again, you see just every imaginable pleasure That has been legitimized in particular cultures. He is Appropriated he has he has success if you look at for example, David Brooks The the road to the road to character. He's got he's got Adam He's got Adam one down his his resume virtues are the top of the heap But it's it's Adam to his eulogy virtues that he's that he's wrestling with I Became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me and all my wisdom In all this my wisdom stayed with me. I denied myself nothing my eyes desired I refused my heart no pleasure My heart took delight in all my labor and was re and and this was the reward of all my toil Yet when I surveyed surveyed all that my hands had done and what I had toiled to achieve Everything was meaningless a chasing after the wind nothing was gained under the Sun Then I turned to my thoughts to consider wisdom and also madness and folly What more can a king successor do than what he has already than what has already been done? I saw that wisdom is better than folly just as light is better than darkness The wise have eyes in their heads while the fools walk around in darkness But I came to realize that the same fate overturns them both in other words If it comes to death once we look into the grave So what so what and and when I read this I hear I? Find this this this book to be so amazingly contemporary when I listen to the conversations about meaning and and Naturalism or or theism or religion and philosophy I find people making these points again and again and again Then I said to myself the fate of the fool will overtake me also what then do I gain by being wise? I said to myself this too is meaningless. This is breath. This is wind This is vanity. This is this is deception. This is illusion For the wise like the fool will not be long remembered The days are art the days have already come when both must be forgotten like the fool the wise Too must die for all your wisdom You can't keep yourself alive and I and I look at our culture where where we in a sense have a Gnostic chase after after health where well I'll go to my doctor who has studied science, but he's limited by science I'm going to go out into the internet and find that the forgotten science the lost keys I'm going to eat this this root or or Exercise in this special way or do this special thing surely in this way I'll cheat death and I through this kind of wisdom now now it's important to to know that in in Old Testament wisdom literature wisdom is as a far broader meeting than just thoughts that are Mmm, it's even hard to describe what we mean by wisdom in English But wisdom has the connotation of skill and excellence and even technology and and so we imagine that through wisdom We can we can cheat death, but you know what I don't care how excellent you are Every one of us goes into that grave So I hated life because the work that is done under the Sun was grievous to me all of it is meaningless Chasing after the wind I hated all the things I had toiled for under the Sun because I must leave them to the one who comes after me and Who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish and and this again I see often with with older older individuals who are setting up their wills and they're they're managing their complex relationships with their children and they're thinking well if I if I Write it into the will this way then surely I can extend myself beyond the grave I can extend extend my my desires and my influence beyond the grave and Here the teacher says it won't work Maybe for a while maybe for a little bit But it won't work those who come after you will take what you leave them and they'll find a way to bend it to themselves our wills are meaningless Yet they will have control over all the fruit of my toil into which I have poured my effort and skill under the Sun This too is meaningless So my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labor under the Sun for a person may labor with wisdom Knowledge and skill and they must leave all they own to anyone who has not toiled for it You know we started out talking about Palo Alto and and the wealth and here these children are born into tremendous wealth and And and so you look at the likes of I Was gonna say I was gonna say Jimmy Buffett No The the likes of Warren Buffett and the and the likes of Bill Gates who who decide they're not gonna leave their massive wealth to their Children they're going to they're going to dispense with it during their lifetime and you think they must have read the book of Ecclesiastes This too is meaningless and a great misfortune. What do people get for all that toil and angst and What do people get for all the toil and the anxious striving with which they labor under the Sun all their days all Their days their work is grief and pain Even at night their minds do not rest this too is meaningless a person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their toil and here we we get kind of to the to the epicurean in In this where you know finally I Should live in the moment and when I sit in front of a fine meal and enjoy that enjoy a fine glass of wine And and even if I'm poor if I you know what some of the best meals I've ever eaten I I've eaten on the tops of of hills in the Dominican Republic where we're desperately poor people scraped together a communal meal after Sunday worship and and and I would remember tasting that meal and thinking I I've eaten no better food in the finest restaurants in New York But that moment on top of the hill eating that that rice and fish and a little guineo You know cooked by hours over a charcoal flame Wind meaningless it's gone a Person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their toil this too I see is from the hand of God for without him who can eat and find enjoyment To the person who pleases him God gives wisdom knowledge and happiness But to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand over to the one who pleases God this gets into a lot of interesting theology and in the Bible and Tremendously interesting conversation that I that I can't go into but but this this idea of of who inherits the earth It is is it the righteous is it the meek what's the relationship between the meek and the righteous? Because if you look for again again at at Jesus list in the sermon on the mount. Well, well, these aren't the teachers and the powerful This too is meaningless a chasing after the wind and then we get to chapter 3 and and this is what this is what brings me to this sermon in fact because in in The Christian Reformed Church in my denomination This is kind of a standard text in in what is in in some ways the most pagan holiday in the in the calendar of the Christian Reformed Church the Christian Reformed Church is the strange tradition of of iconoclasts. They not only destroyed Sculptures they destroyed the liturgical calendar and and they had an aversion to holidays And so, you know churches were expected to walk through the Heidelberg catechism 52 weeks a year We don't pause for Christmas or Easter or anything like that We go through because you know, we have suspicion about these these baptized pagan This baptized pagan calendar yet yet here in the Christian Reformed Church suddenly at New Year's Which which comes to us from Rome in a sense We pause and we stop and we say Once a year it is worthwhile taking an accounting once a weir it is once a year It is worthwhile pausing and saying hmm we together now, perhaps we do this Perhaps we do this once a year when we hit our own birthdays and here's another Interesting ceremony and ritual we maintain but we as a community once a year should pause and say Ebenezer this far the Lord has brought us Huh? What does this mean? What have I done? I should take account I should look at what I've done and and so here in the book of Ecclesiastes where where where the one who has accomplished much Asks himself these existential questions right here in the third chapter We have this lovely song which of course was was put together by I think it was the birds put this together In the 60s just a beautiful song There's a time for everything in a season for every activity under the heavens a Time to be born and a time to die a time to plant in a time to uproot a time to kill and a time to heal a time to tear down and a time to build a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to Dance a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them a time to embrace and a time to refrain from Embracing a time to search and a time to give up a time to keep and a time to throw away a time to tear And a time to mend a time to be silent and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time for war and a time for peace and I think in this song here We we experience the the mystery of our lives where we're on one hand We are the actors in this in this existential play and we are attempting to take stock and to take hold And to and to somehow control our lives to steer it to the destinies we desire Looking back on it. We realize that that even the targets we pick Even the demand even even the statement where we say I am NOT my I am my own unlike the Heideberg Catechism I am my own I belong to me life is what I make it life is mine and no one will make it No one will say it any differently And so the teacher comes and says I better than anyone could say that I had more power more resources more access More opportunity more wisdom more everything and when I look back at what I did in my life It's a breath So then what is life? And then chapter 3 comes in and says Reminds us That life is this mixture of of our own self authorship and and God's authorship and and and God again it's important to remember in the in the Hebrew scriptures that that as as John Walton reminds us in his his book in About about the lost world of Genesis that God is is not separate from the world that God is At work in the world and in all of these circumstances. This is a large sovereign active active God and I think in many ways the reform tradition really captures this and And this God is intimately involved in everything and so when we get this to this chapter We realize that we don't set the times We don't set the scripts. We we certainly have agency We certainly we certainly contribute and we certainly do things But but how much do do we and so and so this this chapter this song here at this point in the book stops us and forces us to recognize in wisdom that our lives are built by a script that we do not make and And and that is good that there is time for all of these things there There is time for happiness and there is time for sorrow There is time for for living in the moment and there's time to stepping back and taking stock over over everything that has happened and and God has made it this way and this amazing thing we call life on planet Earth among human beings is this incredible story and Here it is and God is the author But the teachers not done What do workers gain for their toil I have seen the burden God has laid on the human race and again This is a repetition you might remember it from earlier in the book and and so and so God is telling this story and and working this drama and we are actors in it we we take the stage and and And we we are actors But but we have not formed the script and we are small and we are powerless And and we play our roles and our roles are impeded and conditioned from all that is among us and then verse 11 which Which always just stops me cold He has made everything beautiful in its time He has also set eternity in the human heart Yet no one can fathom what God has done From beginning to end in other words We are these Creatures watching our animal selves Wondering about it trying to trying to know ourselves trying to get a data grip on ourselves to sort ourselves out to To get a handle on what life is and here we are on one hand he has placed eternity in our hearts and he has he has given us a glimpse of What we can never realize in this world and This is our burden and we see it and the scales along the lines of of Everything that is us we see it in the the most mundane Practices of life the things we do every day eating sleeping bathing caring for ourselves Taking care of children going to work dealing with the monotony dealing with the boredom Yet haunted by eternity. He places eternity in our hearts and part of us wonders why? Couldn't we be like the animals isn't this what so often drives suicide if we were like the animals Just I said a dish of food in front of my dog or I I wiggle a table scrap and and the dog and The dog goes nuts. He's living in the moment. He's perfectly in the moment, but we can't do there We have eternity in our hearts. We have time in our head. We live in our past. We live in our future We can't just live in the moment and we say why Lord why have you done this? This existential puzzle of human life we are we are not like the animals We are naturally drawn to seen our lives as a story that that has or demands meaning and we know we will die yet We we have eternity in our hearts. So we scour existence looking to resolve this That now when I when I read through this I'm drawn to CS Lewis's Argument from desire that he that he best lays out perhaps in his his classic mere Christianity because he in a sense says that that that He I think he jumps right in to Ecclesiastes at this point and says something was built into our hearts that Longs for a world. We cannot know we should be like the animals where all we expect is Is life in the moment and then our death but but that isn't us and why? And so CS Lewis postulates and I think this is this is a powerful argument for the existence of everything beyond this frame Where our hearts were built for another world a world which our bodies Don't seem to be connected with We've been built for a different existence one without death But yet a piece of this a piece of us shares in this world As a Christian we get drawn to the the central story of the Christian faith Jesus on the cross Jesus heading to the cross his the chief disciple Peter who just chapters before Promised he would go to death for this man Yet outside Gia's Kang Jesus kangaroo court Peter waits and sees and a servant girl questions him a little later Someone else saw him and said you are also one of them man I am NOT Peter replied about an hour later another asserted certainly this fellow was with him for he is a Galilean Peter replied man. I don't know what you're talking about Just as he was speaking the rooster crowed Jesus turned and looked straight at Peter Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him before the rooster crows today You will disown me three times Now now it's it's helpful to remember that again in the in the Hebrew scriptures Three times is important because a deep hole is deep a deeper hole is deep deep The deepest hole is deep deep deep the Lord is holy. Holy. Holy Peter denies him three times and he went outside and wept bitterly both Matthew and Luke Use these same words to describe what Peter did he goes out and he weeps and And and and the Bible this the story sets us up with a contrast between Peter and Judas Because Judas Judas will Judas will kill himself Peter probably here is at the brink because What has he lived for he put he put all of his chips on this man and What is happening his world is falling apart and and he Peter himself Has contributed to it There's there's nothing more crushing than that if if you're merely the victim of an evil person At least you have yourself But as Frankel says it wasn't the beating it was the insult You will be tested if you live in this world you will be tested you will be tested to the edge of your capacity and Even in the most secure affluent supposedly happiness creating place in the world You will need to come to terms with the deepest questions of your existence in other words your testing might not even come from pain It might come from wealth But you will be tested to your core and how you will be tested And how you answer matters One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him aren't you the Messiah save yourself and us But the other criminal rebuked him. Don't you fear God? He said Since you are under the same sentence We are punished justly for what we are for we are getting what our deeds deserve, but this man has done nothing wrong Then he said Jesus remember me when you come into your kingdom How did this man see that in the middle of his testing earlier in the chapter he's with the other Rebuking him and so Luke quite clearly is is setting us up to to say that there is something in the manner of Jesus crucifixion That stops the individuals in another account the the the Roman centurion who is who is who is? officiating over the torture execution Says surely this man is the son of God What about Jesus trial? That that caused his his most intimate and loyal disciples to run and despair and to hide Brings these people who should know nothing of it In that moment to believe and to have that believe to be said belief to be sufficient for Jesus today Truly, I tell you today You will be with me in paradise just that mere confession by the thief on the cross and Jesus will Remember him when he comes into his kingdom it seems that that that all this thief needed He didn't have time for a catechism. He didn't have time to to learn the scriptures He didn't have time for church But just in that moment the face of the Son of Man lifted up and splayed in agony before the world Changes him and He is remembered He sees in that moment I think the answer to the teachers dilemma Surely you will be with me in paradise now now paradise is a walled garden and So we have a connection back here To the Garden of Eden the original garden Three men being tortured and executed two are getting what wasn't unexpected by their Circumstantial world they were insurgents. They were terrorists one is dramatically ironic It too is a political execution And he is known for doing miracles and loving socially represent reprehensible people Yeah How he suffers Suffers Changes those who we would imagine should not be changed Something in his manner moved observers to not just admire him but to reach out to him with something like worship Two examples were at the complete opposite of the polls the one insurgent Executed executed as an anti-roman terrorist the other the Roman foot soldier Who was there to uphold the law? Throughout the world over time millions and billions of people have come to see this event as the fulcrum of Human history many are moved even by the retelling of the story to be moved like like like these two archetypal witnesses move to address the angst of the Ecclesiastes teacher in the Atlanta article The suicides in Silicon Valley. I was struck by this picture In a sense the students trying to self-heal not just from Whatever it is that's that was driving the suicides, but but what the suicides themselves had driven naturally come back to gratitude and And and sure one might argue that in their affluence and opportunity and wealth they have more more More to be grateful for but but here in the in the movement of the heideberg cataclysm that begins I am not my own but belong body and soul and life and in death to my faithful see of Jesus Christ Who has fully paid for all my sins with his precious blood and has delivered me from the tyranny of the devil and watches Over me in such a way that not a hair can fall from my head without the will of my father in heaven In fact all things must work together for my salvation The the the heideberg cataclysm that begins with this dramatic statement I am not my own and is structured with misery deliverance gratitude Finally when we see the face of the one on the cross and we realize That in the world in the midst of this meaningless life here comes one Who is the answer to our puzzle? The response that we give is gratitude and our gratitude is shaped like him Our gratitude is shaped like him and and and even as we know that his way of life leads him to a cross It also leads him to resurrection that that his way of life leads him leads him to suffer and And to have to have nothing so little that in fact his his his one remaining item of clothing that had any value the soldiers Barter they cast lots To own it and and this man this man Becomes for the millions and billions the key To the meaningless the meaning this of life and how it how it how it pours out into? The existential question that that Ecclesiastes begs. What should I do? We should live with gratitude and your gratitude should be shaped like the one who gave you the gift In other words, there's no higher compliment than imitation and so imitate him Amen
