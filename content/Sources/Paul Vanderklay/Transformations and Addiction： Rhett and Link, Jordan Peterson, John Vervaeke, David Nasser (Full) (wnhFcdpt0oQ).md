 Hi, this is Paul. Those of you watching my channel's channel for a while know I've been I'm always playing with new stuff. So one of the things I've been playing with is abridged and I'm playing with the camera right now. Playing with abridged and extended versions of my videos because my videos tend to be very long and I know a bunch of you really like that. A number of you have also said your videos are very long and I'd like to share them but who on earth is gonna sit through a two hour long video from someone they don't even know is you know then I could add other I could project others of my insecurities out onto that comment. So I've been playing around with abridged and unabridged videos and I'm gonna try something with this when I post this probably next Monday you'll know whether or not it succeeds because I don't know yet either but I'm going to have a version of this video that includes the extended commentary on some video clips and some that don't. In the clip that I released yesterday it was just one segment of my conversation with Dr. Brett Sockhold. I of course am this is one single brain here one consciousness Congress that is working through my rough draft for Sunday which I will record later today my Sunday school lessons my family life my church life and it all flows through the same thing and a couple of days ago someone started in fact a number of people started pointing me to the Rhett and Link Good Mythical Morning I mean these guys have been around since sort of the beginning of YouTube I'd never heard of them at all their comedic pair very much grew up within conservative Christianity in the Bible Belt we're doing evangelical comedy for Campus Crusade for Christ and then transitioned to full-time YouTube-ery and then just recently came out as it were in their lack of Christian faith their transformation now that's the word I'm gonna use for this video and the reason I'm using this word for this video is partly the American habit of feeling safer with abstractions so you have the good place in the bad place you don't have heaven and hell so we'll just we'll just use that because transformations tends to be more of the clinical psychological term for the kinds of transformation or transition or deconstruction or Christians might say deconversion that Rhett and Link have been going through now I want before I speak much about them directly and I've got a bunch of video ideas to treat some of the common elements of their story and these are these are elements that are common not only to each other's stories but to I was listening to Aaron Rogers story last night I hear these stories a lot I'm in very close relationship with people who are in the midst of these stories or have made these stories I pastor a church where people's parents and grandparents go to church but their sons and their grandchildren's and their great-grandchildren don't even though they live in the very same town many of them don't go to any church at all so this this this rise of the nuns and ONES is something that's I'm very familiar with and after you hear enough of these stories patterns begin to develop but before I go into the patterns I want to talk about the dynamic itself because I think part of what interests people in this is in fact the dynamic itself if you listen to the Aaron Rodgers interview that he does with his girlfriend Danica Patrick at the beginning of her podcast she opens up basically with you know her little intro to the to the podcast is all about transformation transformation is what everybody wants to enjoy what everybody wants to possess what everyone wants to achieve but but in a good way good transformations because we know that there are bad transformations someone who is not unfamiliar to this channel is Job and I've got his picture down in the corner here Job underwent a transformation after listening to Jordan Peterson talking to me but that was just part of a much longer and once you get to know Job you begin to realize it's part of a much longer journey and so part of the reason many people on this channel have been fascinated with Job is number one if they went to the discord server the link to that is at the show notes they've gotten to know Job Job has has had conversations with many other people interviewing people and so Job has sort of become the pastor of the discord and Job has joined his church in the Netherlands and Job will be going on tour with me and John Van Donk in March and there'll be other video there's some video announcements about that in this in the channel and there'll be some more as the as the venues and times get solidified the dates are pretty much solidified in terms of the cities that we're going to I'm gonna play some lengthy I'm gonna play most of the conversation that Jordan Peterson did with David Nassar because I thought that was that was a really terrific example of Peterson himself and his Petersonian way navigating the question of transformations because if you understand the work of Jordan Peterson and what he done through a lot of his work he was all about individual transformation helping people make their life better that was his goal that was his goal as a clinical psychologist that was very much his goal in terms of the Jordan Peterson phenomenon chapter that was October 2016 to June 2019 those are really the dates from his rise because of Canadian Bill C-16 up until his illness his attempt to withdraw from medication that he had been taking under prescription tried to get off it and you can look at Michaela Peterson's video about that I'm also going to bring in John Verbecky on this one too a video of his from awakening from the meeting crisis that entire series is about transformation John's religion that is not a religion is about transformation and so when we listen to Rhett and Link talk about their deconstruction we're really talking about transformations and I want to make a number of points about transformations before we begin talking about their particular instances now someone had commented to me Tim from who comes to the meetup sometime because again I had yesterday I'd posted a video just a clip from my my conversation with Brett Dr. Brett Sokold he said well probably a lot of people listening to them aren't going to understand everything that you're doing yeah that's probably true and so this video will probably help them orient better to what those of you have been following my channel for a long time are much more aware of the characters on my channel the topics on my channel the kinds of things my channel is in many ways a reflection of myself the things that interest me this is my personal channel this is not necessarily my church work nobody looks over my shoulder and says you should and shouldn't put things on this channel part of the reason I like doing this as a personal channel is because someone could say well you shouldn't do this because of such-and-such well I'm doing the channel they're not that's why I keep my church I have there's a church channel that has my Sunday school lessons and my sermons on one channel but this is on another channel I can be a little bit freer Freddie and Paul shows on this channel that was that started before my whole Jordan Peterson thing and if you go before my Jordan Peterson videos you can find the Freddie and Paul show that's that's something that Freddie wanted to do Freddie's a friend of mine and I've just he and I have been doing this and his mom comes on and other characters come on so so on and so forth but transformations is a big deal and it's a big deal far beyond the Christian Church and ideas of conversion almost every major world religion again a definition of religion that I postulated a few videos ago religions are human authoring programs and so we're all very interested in transformations what does that involve what are they how do we know if they're good or bad that's what this video is going to be about now transformations take place with respect to time and that's important and again if you look at my conversation with Brett Sokol the distinction between natural and human is a complex one I want to not lean too heavily on it but yet not ignore it and so we see transformations in the life cycle of a star there's first a stellar nebula then perhaps it's an average star like the Sun that we enjoy at some point it will become a red giant which we imagine well that would then swallow up and destroy all life on the planet planet earth and then a planetary nebula and then a white dwarf why do we why do we know this well in a sense because of light and how light travels and astronomy we can look up in the heavens and we can in a sense see the various stages of this process because the light that we finally see for eight distances in space is older star nebula is some stars are massive stars and then they become a red giant and then they supernova and they can become a neutrino star black hole this is the current physics says astrophysics says this these are the life cycles of a star all of those things are transformations we're more familiar with transformations of let's say a butterfly begins as an egg and then becomes a caterpillar then a chrysalis then an adult emerges then an adult and this little schema avoids further transformations which is aging death and decay and cue the Lion King the circle of life well there we have there we have all of these transformations these transformations are involuntary the egg doesn't somehow decide consciously in the way that we understand conscious decision-making to become a caterpillar a chrysalis an adult same thing happens to us we are born we don't choose the parents that we're born to in the way that we choose whether we're going to have a Big Mac or a quarter pounder with cheese we we're born we have DNA we're raised we're subject to all sorts of influences but you know at some there's there are clocks going on in our body and and we if the if what we see as the normal process continues we will continue to grow to develop mature there's puberty there's adulthood there's aging and then there's death and then the body breaks down and is consumed by the bacteria worms whatever's eating us so transformations involuntary transformations happen all over the place now involuntary again in terms of human volition and and anything that we currently understand in ourselves as conscious choice and we see it all around the world we see it in the animal kingdom we see it over time now before I get too deep into this I again want to point to Daniel Bonavac's excellent video looking at the philosophical work of Wilfred Sellers who differentiates between the manifest image and the scientific image I'm not going to play that video today I've played it in a number of videos the link will be in the notes below if you're curious at seeing it he notes that there are these two images that we constantly work with the scientific image which is about science and the manifest image which is sort of life the way we live it one of the things that you'll know in Rhett's deconstruction story is the questions about the Bible and science loomed very large in his deconstruction story and that is by no means uncommon recognizing these two different visions I think is fundamental and as Wilfred Sellers noted as Daniel Bonavac articulates in this little video the difference between them is the normative and if we go back and we look and we say well is a stellar nebula good and a white dwarf bad well those categories don't really fit is a stellar nebula nebula better is an average star better is a massive star better well better for what immediately immediately comes to mind is the egg better than the adult monarch butterfly well better for what better to eat better I mean those categories really don't fit the scientific image but we can't live without them in the manifest image so is a butterfly better than an egg science can't tell you that is a black hole better than a stable mature star like the Sun science can't tell you that it can tell you a lot of things that are different about a black hole and the thing that we call the Sun in our cosmology but science can't science can't tell you that now normativity and cap you and what normativity does is is it encapsulates the personal observer which again is a very big issue in in philosophy right now and in science normativity is part of the manifest image and the manifest image has within it the observer okay science is attempts to be of you from nowhere attempts to be objective like this is always true or true in a moment which is a timeless moment and again in my past videos I've talked about all these kinds of things so let's keep this distinction in mind because it actually functions pretty powerfully in this whole question of transformations transformations whereas we can look at them in a sense scientifically and we can observe a variety of things about it science can't tell us well how should I feel about an average star versus a massive star how should I feel about the transformations that go on within me all of those involve the observer and the the personal observer all right now in the animal kingdom we see transformations all the time so I didn't have my dog when he was a puppy my dog is a rescue dog so got him as a very problematic adult and but I love my dog even though my dog bites lots of people fortunately the dog isn't a very big dog and people seem to forgive him when he bites people unlike my Rottweilers that never bit a soul but everybody was afraid of them so my little dog has skin problems my dog has skin problems all the time and for the first oh gosh six years that we've lived that we lived with the dog back and forth to the vet this med that that medication and just all kinds of issues trying to get the dog's skin clear we get the dog skin cleared up and we have them on all these medications and then you know take them off the medications and back the skin would come high-priced hypogenic dog flu blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah finally my wife then just a fit of frustration went to the internet we put him on the Jordan Peterson diet that dog eats hamburger that's what he eats and well he's not strictly on the Jordan Peterson diet he also eats an egg a little while ago we tried out a little bit more rice to the diet for some certain reasons that I won't go into and sure enough he starts smelling yeasty all over again and okay back to the hamburger and since the dogs been on hamburger the dogs really the dogs really done done very very well I have to put my watch on do not disturb for a couple hours because otherwise I get disturbed so he lost weight his skin problems cleared up he had better energy everything he's like a new dog we say now this is a transformation I brought to my dog my dog eats whatever he wants to eat whether it's good for him or not and then once that yeast infection gets going he scratches and scratches and he he will literally scratch all of his fur off and he'll just have swaths of himself that are raw and bleeding and it's a mess I bring the transformation to my dog now I don't cause the transformation the diet is clearly involved in the transformation but it's only the will of myself and my wife were imposing this on the dog now he's very happy to eat hamburger and you know being the cheap Dutchman that I am it pains me when I have to buy hamburger for this animal as opposed to the cheapo dog food that we began with but you know it's actually it's cheaper to feed him hamburger than to pay the vet and pay for the medicine and everything's better so hey but the point here is that I bring this transformation to my dog my dog does not manage this transformation to the best of our knowledge dogs don't understand and have any kind of self-transcendence from the transformation like we have we have all kinds of self-transcendence we watch ourselves in our transformations my dog doesn't watch himself in the transformation we transform him in fact if you look at that little dog people who do genetics say dogs were you know domesticated from wolves and if you look at my tiny little dog you'd say where on earth is the wolf in that dog now maybe in his bite but the dog looks nothing like a wolf in fact the dog is a victim of human transformations in terms of old-style genetic engineering and breeding so that he's tiny and cute and fluffy and has a flat face and on and on and on but as a terrible personality that's my dog so he's been the product of lots of transformations from wolf down to a dog he's a product of our own transformation experimentation in terms of his diet and I think for the most part we want good things for my dog and and he's done he's done fairly well so humans have a level of agency far beyond what we see in other creatures that we know we have a myriad of complex hierarchies as human beings and capacity to change our environment our level of social complexity all of that not only do we have the capacity to colonize or enact transformations involuntarily from the position of the dog upon dogs and upon just about everything else in the world we do it upon ourselves and we do it upon ourselves all the time and we desire to do it upon ourselves in fact we we desire to change ourselves for the better and that entire process again we're calling transformation and it takes many forms and many shapes now there's an excellent video out there by Will Schroeder called every story is the same and again I'll put the I'll put the link down in the in the show notes below and it talks about Joseph Campbell and the hero's journey in the monomyth and of course anybody familiar with Jordan Peterson knows that Peterson in many ways now Peterson has some real differences from Joseph Campbell which he which if you back him into a corner he'll forced to mention but you know Jung is behind this and so very much similar thing from the work that Joseph Campbell did a number of years ago now here's the thing about transformation we represent them we manage them we interact with them we codify them we communicate them we they're all framed by story and again if you look at Jonathan John Verveckis John Verveckis conversation with Benjamin Boyce which I've played in the past John Vervecki talks about the fact that story is a psychotechnology that we possess and again this is something that I thought of long before I started doing the Jordan Peterson stuff I was thinking about maybe a book that I wanted to write because I was thinking about the fact that we are stories and in fact this is something that that Brett Sockel mentioned yesterday said you know that that I began as a seed from my father and the egg of my mother those two elements as such are gone and then they unite and they multiply that initial cell is gone and you know there are all these ideas about every seven years all the cells of my body change and I'm not a biologist I don't know how to evaluate that or or to qualify that or to nuance that but generally speaking I'm a very different creature than the fertilized egg that was in my mother's womb I'm a very different creature than the the the baby that my mother birthed and brought into the world I'm a very different creature than a third grader a fifth grader I'm now in my mid-50s and I'm a very different creature in some ways than I am in my 30s but more alike of what I was in my 30s I've undergone a number of transformations since my 30s I have lost much of my hair my hair has turned gray my teeth continue to get older physiologically I'm aging I'm not as strong as I was I'm just in and strong strong in the in the broader sense I'd probably be more susceptible to virus but but you know I can undergo transformations in terms of diet and exercise medical science all of those things that even within my adult lifespan things will go up and down there have been tremendous transformations in me and in fact one of the common questions I get from people who watch my videos is what are the transformations that Jordan Peterson has brought in you or what are the transformations that making videos have brought in you and what are the transformations of on and on and on and on now I think part of the benefit of doing something like this in my 50s is that in some ways the cake is baked and my the speed of transformation is is no longer what it was when I was conceived when I was an infant when I was a toddler when I was a preschooler even when I was a teenager and even in my early 20s brain pests you know plasticity you know the cake is baked so that I'm going to see lower levels of transformation but but the only way we can sort of track these things or can kind of or can communicate these things are by story and this is part of the reason stories fascinate us because stories are all about transformations and he write in his first book and his magnum opus about basically Christianity in the world he spends a great deal of time in that first book in proland talking about what a story is little red riding hood is not a story I mean just that little red riding hood little red riding hood went to her grandmother's well now we're getting somewhere but it's not a terrible terribly interesting story little red riding hood was going to grandmother's and she had a basket of goodies for her grandmother and wolf met her along the trail and the wolf speaks and and now we have a story now we have something interesting now we have something engages that engages us I would I would say that what is built into us in terms of our desire for meaning is a desire for transformation that is something deep within us but again this this is this is carried by us understood by us seen by us in story I told you the story of my dog and his transformation via his diet but my dog has no such story my dog is is like my dog has very limited amount of self-transcendence in terms of he can't stand back from himself and say oh you know when he was feeding us when they were feeding me first that cheap dog food then that very expensive dog food and now the hamburger I my body was in different ways that my dog doesn't look in the mirror and ponder his existence to the best of our knowledge my dog simply is people often say well live in the moment and I always think like my dog my dog lives in the moment I don't care to live in the moment I care to live in a story a story that I can a story that I can manipulate that I can set myself back from a story that allows me to look at myself in a different way stories that allow me to see other people allow me to sort of conceptualize other people and all of story is very very important in terms of how this all works we use story to frame and track transformations a human story is a story in a way that a dog doesn't have we are a story in a way that we're not a body but we're an embodied story and we keep making new stories and again if you haven't watched my conversation with dr. Brett so cold that was boy that was a highlight of my channel that conversation you have conversations sometimes and they just go so well and you just want to get up and dance it well that's what's actually what I do in my office I get up and I dance a little dance after I have a conversation like that because it was just so good and we it just get meshed into a whole bunch of the things that I've been working on in my in my YouTube and all of that now we are nested stories because not only do we conceptualize ourselves and represent ourselves as a story we represent the world in story form and again in fact we can go all the way back I represent my dog in story form and and in many ways the life cycle of a star is a storified representation of a star and if you just look in a telescope you won't see the story what you do is you see the different elements and you create a story out of it and it's that story that you tell to other people and it's story nested within stories nested within with nested within stories now these conceptualizations are storified okay and I've I often in my videos if you go in the past them I'll ask is is uncle Sam real I'll say well what do you mean by real and again my conversation with Brett so cold made the point that for us there are realities which are greater now we're introducing hierarchy and I would see there are hot there are realities which are not material we might call them inter relational we might call them informational but they are not material and they colonize materiality so I might say well is uncle Sam real and you might say no I can't uncle Sam does not have an address I can't go to a place and lay hands on uncle Sam Jonathan Pajot talks about Santa Claus is Santa Claus real ask a kid yeah I just saw him at the mall well is that Santa Claus well yes is that the real Santa Claus what do you mean is that actually the instantiation of Santa Claus and I would say is uncle Sam real he's real enough for you to pay your taxes he's that real and in fact he's real enough to to motivate young men during the first and second world war to lay down their life for him and so we have these principalities that are conceptualized up and they're also conceptualized as stories and they're also conceptualized as persons and that is instinctive to us all right and and now these stories the mono myth it's really it's really very interesting that the hero's journey the story all of this stuff there are patterns and structures to all of this and and we cannot as human beings without them we have agency within our stories our stories in many ways we we have not we have immaterial agents within our stories every time you hear someone talk about the patriarchy or white supremacy what they're essentially doing is locating agency within a very long story and they're saying that agency is to blame and we have to kill that agency okay that's a conceptualization again nobody like uncle Sam imagines you can go to a particular street address find white supremacy and put white supremacy to death or find the patriarchy and put the patriarchy to death but notice what we're doing with our stories we're lending agency to that story and in fact we're we're we're placing normativity upon that upon that agency and we're we're very easily using this within our story this is how human beings work and in the past this is what happened with religion all right now again if you talk to Sam Harris the issue of agency and free will comes up a lot and so you can watch why Sam Harris and Brett Weinstein keep tripping over free will a video that I did a few weeks ago we feel ourselves to have consequential agency within our stories we bear a degree of responsibility within our stories we can pretty much not conceptualize or work communally or socially or interrelationally without this element of responsibility and personhood and agency human interaction human life as we know it on this world cannot exist without this now Sam Harris tries to flip over to the scientific image and say up via the scientific image we have no agency but then Sam Harris goes on podcast to try and convince us that within the scientific image we have no agency and that's where I talked about Sam Harris is kind of switching the patch over one eye oh now I'm looking at the scientific image oop now I'm looking at the manifest image oop now I'm telling a scientific story oh now I'm telling a manifest image story so back and forth back and forth back and forth and that's what that video was about I played the Daniel Bonavac scientific manifest image story but within the manifest image we cannot conceptualize it as as not being agents and not only just human beings as agents but these other agents within human humanity Uncle Sam white supremacy racism you know all of these things that we basically conceptualize and if you take it for again I'm gonna sound like Jordan Peterson from a psychological perspective God and the gods as agents that that move us Cupid Mars the god of war just this this is what human beings have done all along and we can't help but do it and we will continue to do it because it's the only way we can actually work with each other and manage ourselves because we are all these nested stories now we are blessed or cursed in terms of normativity by the agency of others white supremacy has been a curse to African Americans especially in the Jim Crow South patriarchy has been a curse for women who have been victims of the patriarchy and on and on and on and on let's say communism was a curse for all of the people that were in communism nazism was a curse for the Jewish populations of Eastern Europe on and on and on we go this is these these are the waters that we swim in and and you will find and I've made this point many times that for the most part when people sort of deconstruct their religion they don't really leave religion they just change a lot of the conceptualizations and I see people sort of well maybe they grew up Christian and now then they're an agnostic or an atheist phase but before you know it they start talking to the universe and they say the universe has given me this and the universe has given me that and karma this and karma that again my best example of this is Verizon Lisa you can go back a number of years and look at the LG Lucid Verizon phone commercial where Lisa's walking by and you know she sees a Verizon store with a new smartphone it's not really a smartphone those Lucids weren't I don't even remember if they were androids anyway universe is telling me and so the universe is speaking to her she's having a conversation with the universe this is what we do as human beings we've always done this and we're not going to stop now what's interesting is that we have a bit of self-transcendence with this dynamic about ourselves and this came out recently with Michelle Williams and her speech at the Golden Globes and I'll put the links below in the show notes but what was very interesting about her speech was that she was basically saying my agency over my story is the most important thing in my world and she talked about her abortion and well what is abortion abortion is a degree of colonization with the help of medical professionals because that's that's a critical thing that's seldom looked at your right to an abortion seems to be connected with the demand you can place on a doctor to to perform that procedure on you it's not simply you don't go into a doctor and say oh I have the right to choose remove my hand doctors won't do that I have the right to choose remove my leg doctors won't do that doctors need a reason but in this particular procedure well they offer a reason and so this is what she says about her life I've tried my very best to live a life of my own making and right when I heard that I thought did you choose your genetics did you use that you choose the zip code the parents the school on and on and on and on and on your maybe you chose your hair color but you know there's the vast majority of your life you never chose you are trying as best you can via story to colonize your body and even you know hey lately I've been trying to go on a diet I really haven't hit my eye what I think is my ideal weight so you know on and off I go on my diet I can't even colonize me very well and but I've tried to live my best life my very best life well what is that there's a representation out there again watch towards the end of John Verveckis awakening from the meaning crisis the second self there's a lot of that going on and in the in the talk of the world and and that will be in some of the Jordan Peterson clip that I play with this conversation with David Nasser but you know I've tried I've tried my very best to live a life of my own making and not just a series of events that happened to me what is she saying I've lived my very life in terms of a human authoring program I've lived to try to self author my story I don't just want to be the recipients of a bunch of events that have happened to me well what event caused the pregnancy was that consensual I hope so probably but it wasn't within the timing of the larger story that she had but one that I could stand back and look at and recognize my handwriting all over okay she you have to ask well what is her what is that self what is that person in the middle of this that she's trying to manifest herself in her story and in her life sometimes messy and scrawling sometimes careful and precise she's using a metaphor but again this is this is she's looking for transformations but she herself wants to direct her transformation and have that be a transformation that she sees as better as ideal again this is basic yet it is so steeped in our particular culture and our particular frame of reference it's extremely religious but she if there's no supernatural beings involved people might not say it's religious well it's spiritual okay what do you mean by spiritual what do you mean by that very fudgy word can you please tell me what is spiritual can you explain to me the difference between spiritual here and school spirit if you think about that relationship you might actually have something if you think about well a corpse is a dead person and they when they have you know a living spirit inside of them then they're animated and you can get into much older ideas of spirit so why is spirit and breath if again you go back and you look at the videos that I did about about I almost said I almost said BB Warfield anyway if you go back and look at my other videos you know that but why why do our language why does it why I'm the Owen Barfield why do why do we connect breath and life why do we connect wind and spirit why all these words well she's probably in very spiritual I don't know what she thinks of religion I have no idea really I don't even know what movie she was in I just caught this because obviously because the whole abortion thing this thing got shot up there on Twitter but one that I had carved with my own hand there's another metaphor and I wouldn't have been able to do it without employing a woman's right to choose and her right to demand a doctor to perform a procedure on her I mean that's what we're talking about here but again she's saying agency agency is the goal whatever I am deconstructed or not whatever this this this thing is in me this self this this story writer inside I what what goodness is is a world that is plastic and like putty in my hand to the point that I can mold it and shape it to myself and and that others will collaborate and and be helpful on my path towards my my second self my sacred self my my hidden secret self that needs to be manifest again you start getting into this and you're you're you're all over it religions are all over the place on this your best self my best self now my ideal self I mean this is stuff that we've been talking about for a fairly long time now in the American zeitgeist an individual won't go back to the Declaration of Independence an individual should pursue their dream and their self or their life life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that's essentially what Thomas Jefferson following John Locke was saying and so the role of our society is to afford Michelle Williams the person that she is the agent that she is the self authoring story that she is the ability to write her own story to the degree and in the shape that she wants to see it written now we aspire to achieve all levels of agency but agency is a very funny thing a number of weeks ago a woman was in my church for a couple weeks she'll probably show up again I suspect she lives in a group home somewhere around I don't know her technical diagnosis but having had a lot of experience with a lot of visuals I suspect she's an untreated schizophrenic and she visited the church and we have a lot of schizophrenics that come into the church and said and do their things and my congregation is just pretty accustomed to all of this because again they've been through it for a long time and my congregation has a huge heart and so they often if given opportunity and there have been some really interesting stories in the past where they really helped a number of people live with their schizophrenia she's semi homeless and she had a few things in bags and so I tried to help her out Sunday and then you know she got into the Anglican Church that uses our sanctuary afterwards well that conversation didn't go well but then she came back Monday and the lady runs the child care center here that conversation didn't go well so she calls me and say pastor you gotta do something with this woman so so I came down and you know had more of a chance to talk to her than I had on Sunday because Sunday I'm busy with a lot of different people too so she's from space she got very close relationship with God and she's managing all those things that same self that same pictured used to be a cage that was surrounded an air conditioning units to keep people from stealing it that one day I found another homeless schizophrenic woman sitting in that cage there's a there's basically the the gas meter is right in that cage and of course the child care center was going they were a little disturbed that there's this homeless woman who's sitting there and people are picking up and dropping off their children and so I sat down and talked to her and she explained to me that she was running the American space program right there from the gas meter in the no longer used cage at Living Stones and I was skeptical you know her reality my reality but but she was but many of these people express a great deal of agency now the agency that they expressed to me doesn't usually match the agency I see but you know at some point I'll usually mention to them that I have a degree of agency in terms of my responsibility towards the various organizations that use this building and so I try to modulate that as well as I can I usually try and walk a line but we achieve levels of agency and I think for many of these people that they're from space or that they're managing the American space program from the gas meter at Living Stones Church in Sacramento California and that gives them a degree of meaning they enjoy their agency in fact agency and meaning are deeply tied we we sense meaning when we're when we're exercising our agency okay and again we'll get into John Raviky and Jordan Peterson very shortly actually in this video just this morning when I came to work I actually today I decided not to drive because when I do drive and my cars in the parking lot I get quite a few more visitors at my door because people in the neighborhood you know if they see my car there then they know they stop in and we have a chat or whatever we do but I decided not to drive today so that I could have a little bit more time to make videos and do some office work today and Billy Billy's there Billy has been sleeping by the door Billy I don't know if that's his real name or not people on the street people give you names and there might be names it might be nicknames I don't ask for driver's license I don't ask for ID but let's just call him Billy and Billy you know Billy will be out there sleeping for a little while it becomes irregular and we'll start having conversations that's the way this thing works and then we'll start having conversations and we get him to share share my life but because I know lots of other people on the street and they give me information about Billy ah Billy's sleeping over at your church and because they have the same drug dealer as Billy so I know what kind of drugs he's using and I have a sense of well how dangerous is he and do I have to run him off right now or is this someone who's a little bit more you know some you know and so I'm always managing these kind of things and when you have untreated schizophrenics coming into church you know people with children begin to look around and say is this a safe place sorta I'll I keep an eye on things and that's what I do I keep an eye on things and hopefully bad things don't happen every now and then something bad does happen but that's kind of life so Billy has a drug issue Billy has some issues with his either present or ex-wife Billy has a homeless issue but he's got a lot of issues Billy's depressed so it's a lot of the other homeless people I know come along and they diagnose each other because they're all in and out of mental hospitals all the time and they're all familiar with this language and round and around we go now homelessness is a huge issue in in California right now it's a big topic of conversation and people want to help people feel sympathy for the homeless people are annoyed and disgusted you know just a little bit up there there's a turd sitting in the grass and when I catch Billy awake one of these days and say Billy it can't be leaving turds in the grass you got to clean that stuff up and you know so Billy and I will do a lot of negotiating and we'll do a certain amount of relating and Billy's what I will tolerate certain things around here and I will not tolerate other things around here and there's a lot of difference of opinion in terms of what I should and shouldn't tolerate I engage these negotiations and conversations also with the church leadership in mind and you know we try to walk this line I you know one of the things talk about religion in the Bible you have the story of Lazarus and the rich man don't want to be the rich man stepping over this guy and and I'll Paul Vanderkley you know there's Billy Billy's in the bosom of Abraham and you're in the part of Hades that's getting a little hot and say Lord can you have Billy come down and bring me a water a little bit of water just to cool my tongue these stories roam around in our imagination and they seep into the culture and they seep into the site guys and they seep seep into our moral structures and so another homeless guy used to stay here a lot it often really if there's a psychologist out there tell me what the deal is with homeless people in shoes please so there's a and and mental illness in shoes so this guy you know he never wanted to wear shoes he's while I was walking around barefoot his feet were a mess and people would always stop by and give him shoes and he'd say people always give me shoes I hate shoes and people would give him things you'd always accept it then he'd kind of go through what they give him and he'd keep what he'd wanted throw out the other and all that garbage would stay on my property unless somebody else came along and one man's garbage is another man's treasure and on and on and on and on but addiction almost almost all of these people are struggling with what we would call substance abuse and almost all of these people and again you have conversations drug addicts know their drugs they know their drug dealers and they know the they know the prescribed drugs and the unprescribed drugs and you know I have a lot of conversations with these people about their drugs and you know well how do these people are self-medicating alcohol is a powerful powerful drug it's a very useful drug bipolar's try to level out with alcohol though when they're when they're manic alcohol for some of them slows them down a little bit and and when they're depressed alcohol takes the edge off and you know a friend of mine I mean his greatest heart was to wake up sober you don't want to wake up sober that might mean that he just you know would urinate in his blanket even though he doesn't have another blanket and they know on and on and on and on I've lived in 22 first day I came to work here at this church there was a homeless woman sitting in the parking lot and it's for 22 years I've just had relationships with this population and it's just the way it goes but people in California are frightened and well what can we do about these people let's put them in tiny houses housing first let's wrap around services on and on and on and on and on these programs might help are they gonna solve the problem probably not because human beings are not problems to be solved and we're mysteries to ourselves and this is difficult but addiction is a very big deal and addiction has in many ways taken on a clinical reality and we have we have approached addiction sort of in the way that I approach Mookie and his skin problems and maybe if we can alter the environment we can help with an addiction and there's good reason to believe that now one of my favorite videos in John Verveckis series is episode 13 where he talks about Buddhism parasitic processing and he talks about a friend of his who does a lot of work on addiction and because well addiction is one of the things that one of the ways that alcoholics anonymous tried to encourage people to find help in society for their alcohol problem was to try to reduce the stigma by medicalizing alcoholism and so alcoholism is a disease and then later on when we had more ideas about how the brain works oh there's a genetic predisposition predisposition to alcoholism alcoholism the attempt was to take alcoholism away from the moral valence alcohol is not a moral problem and this is where you get into questions of should you incarcerate drug users or should you put them in treatment programs now is addiction a moral question now if you're the son or child of an alcoholic or the partner of an alcoholic or the neighbor of an alcoholic sort of like I am right now moral notions crop up okay you should not lay turds in the landscaping at Living Stones you should not strewn the bushes with your dirty toilet paper you should not just urinate here so that it smells like a toilet when I have to come into my office you should not you should not you should not these are all moral questions but then we get the question of agency to what degree can he manage himself and these are the kinds of questions that anyone who's dealt with an addict deals with continually where is their agency in the addiction now John Vervecki will talk about this in terms of see I'm thinking about now I'm gonna do the long and the short version of this video John I think the short versions are gonna be plenty long John Vervecki is gonna do the reset he's gonna talk about addiction in terms of agency and reciprocal narrow narrowing and if you listen to the whole video he connects that with Buddhism and I was just re-listening to the whole video on my walk here to church so I don't have my car here so I don't have too many bangs on the door while I'm trying to make a video and reciprocal narrowing that's what addiction is if there's such a thing as reciprocal narrowing is there also reciprocal enlargening or as he'll use the term enlightening now if you listen to Rhett and Link no I haven't forgotten about them if you listen to Rhett and Link you'll notice that as for many people who have undergone a voluntary transformation even sometimes an involuntary transformation they'll say my life is better now better in what way to look at categoricals or universals is very difficult but they could say you know getting sober was hard but it was an improvement and in fact when I was I had one homeless person he sat in that chair right there and he had a can of beer with him and he sat that can of beer on the on my table and he said my life is in that can and this individual he worked he worked as a painter and he would works a painter basically repainting apartments for a guy who had a lot of apartments and just needed repainted after every tenant left so we'd repaint the apartment and he'd get paid under the table and most of the time he would sleep outside because he didn't want to pay rent because rent would take a lot of his income and he would rather devote almost all of his income to alcohol so he said my life is in that can he understood that stood that about himself and many of the homeless addicts that I deal with have had periods of sobriety in their life they've been through 12-step programs multiple times they've been in and out of psychiatric facilities locked and unlocked on and on and on and on and on and they have a degree of self-transcendence about it and they understand the fact that if you're an addict you don't want agency and and so so John in this video is going to talk about agency and now John is a professor at the University of of Toronto if you've been on my channel a while John has been on my channel a number of times we have regular conversations I look forward to sharing a stage with him in in Thunder Bay Ontario when we do this conference with Jonathan Peugeot really looking forward to that conference really looking forward to meeting John and Jonathan in person and spending time with them and having conversations with them all of my conversations with John Vervecki have been just wonderful experiences along with some of John's friends that that I've gotten acquainted with Guy Sengstock and Christopher Mastro Pietro I mean John's got a wonderful community around him and you know some people found John through my channel and some people have found me through John's channel and this little corner of the internet has been a wonderful thing but he's a cognitive he's a he's a cognitive scientist and so he tries to work on all of these things in terms of the big picture and so he makes the point in this video that it's not simply a biochemical relationship you can be addicted to video games drug addiction is if it were merely biochemical it would look very different in people's lives a 12-step program talking you know and community accountability wouldn't be as helpful why does age and and addiction why are they involved a lot of people get sober at a certain age just because because of age you know on and on and on this stuff is different so if you are watching the abridged version you're not gonna see the video if you're watching the full version you can see the video so this is episode 13 Buddhism and parasitic processing my colleague and good friend Mark Lewis we're talking about comparing this to other work that he's recently and if you want to know what this is watch the whole video again the the link to it's in the notes he'd been doing so some of you may know Mark Lewis I highly recommend you take a look at his work Mark has been deeply influential in my own thinking ideas about dynamical processing self-organizing systems development he is one of the foremost important neuroscientists about addiction and how addiction works in the world I strongly recommend reading his book memoirs of an addicted brain so mark was himself I'm not disclosing anything confidential because it's right in the book Mark was himself an addict in his youth and then he overcame his addiction then and he went into the neuroscience to try and figure out why what is addiction how does it work now that's important because addiction right this addiction is primarily the loss of agency it's not I mean addiction is distressing and painful but when we're talking about some being somebody being addicted the way we finally diagnose them is by how dysfunctional they become how much they lose their agency now it's important to recognize that dysfunctional here is also within an arena okay because someone might say that Billy laying out here on what another homeless person deemed the foundation of the Lord it's the sidewalk in front of my front of my office is the foundation of the Lord Billy laying on the foundation of the Lord we would deem him as dysfunctional because we have some ideas and representations of what a functional human being should look like and I agree with those I don't think it's in Billy's best interest to basically spend 12 hours sleeping it off and 12 hours doing drugs I don't think that's a functional way to live and Billy it probably gets a check every month from the government and to the best of my knowledge Billy isn't doing any crime I haven't seen any evidence of it I get used to seeing evidence of these kinds of things if you know enough people but that's what's going on with Billy and it's dysfunctional it's dysfunctional as compared to ideas and representations and paradigms and archetypes of functionality right so you are a video game addict if you are playing video games to the point where you cannot pursue the goals you want to pursue in your life you cannot establish and cultivate the relations you want to establish in your life you cannot cultivate the kind of character or identity you aspire to if the video gaming is robbing you of those agentic processes then of course that is what we mean by addiction addiction is a loss of agency now when you take a look at Mark's work Mark challenges Mark Lewis he challenges right I just saw him give a talk I've been having lunch with him but but I also saw him have just a really good talk at the Society for psychology and philosophy or philosophy and psychology we'll get the order right just this past year and he was not the only person making this point but he articulated it with his own particular explanation which is his so the point that many of people are making is the standard model of addiction is incorrect fundamentally wrong what's the standard model standard model is we have a biophysical chemical dependency and when the chemical is removed we get an overwhelming compulsion to have to seek out the chemical and if we don't get the chemical then we soft I sped it up there because like many people I listen to different people on different speeds and but if you listen to this on a certain speed then it gets multiplied so I'm gonna back it up because what he said right there was really important I don't want it to go by too quickly fur to have chemical this are making his particular person and he was not the only person making this point but he articulated it with his own particular explanation which is his so the point that many of people are making is the standard model of addiction is incorrect fundamentally wrong what's the standard model standard model is we have a biophysical chemical dependency and when the chemical is removed we get an overwhelming compulsion to have to seek out the chemical and if we don't get the chemical then we suffer similar to as if we were starving from a lack of food and if we and so that's what addiction is and the problem with this is it sounds very common-sensical and the media likes it it has the one unfortunate feature of being almost completely false because first of all you can get addicted to process now we might we might ask why does the media like it why do we like it why so it's so the dance with respect to addiction and morals is a complicated one because is extremely powerful and what often gets lost when people get full of their own moral self-righteousness and certainty is nuance and when it comes to addiction there's a lot of nuance going on here it's not just a chemical dependence it's there's a lot going on because it's tied into everything that we are now why are we talking so much about addiction in this video about transformations well we'll get there but because addiction is a fundamental negative transformation that many of us are familiar with but it illustrates the complexity of these transformations and John's going to go there this is that have no biochemical basis like gambling for example secondly if the if the overwhelming compulsion model was correct you have a great deal of difficulty explaining some very very pertinent facts most people spontaneously give up their addiction in their 30s we of course get focused on the people who remain addicted and therefore we come to believe that addiction is an overwhelming compulsion but if you actually track people many people spontaneously stop being addicted here's a great historical example spontaneously is an interested word because some things in their life brought them to seek a transformation now whether or not when we say spontaneously it might appear spontaneous to them it might appear self authoring to them I've known a number of people who let's say they had a few DUIs but then gave up drinking just themselves they didn't go through 12-step program they didn't go to detox they didn't do any of that they cold turkey they did it themselves you find lots of people like that you have soldiers in Vietnam during the Vietnam War getting addicted to opioids in Vietnam crisis not that it isn't a crisis but we tend to think that certain chemicals are intrinsically addictive so not to say that certain chemicals aren't in terms of addictive as opposed to other things certain chemicals certainly tend to be more prone to addiction than others but they get addicted to heroin when they return to the United States now now if you understand John's whole work in terms of one of his best videos he does with Christopher Mastro Pietro about the symptomology of the meaning crisis and so the opioid addiction is not simply as usually the tale goes that I got you know I had a surgery and they put me on opioids and now I got on them well that may very well be true and certainly the quote that the type of substance it is lends itself to that John certainly would recognize that opioids are more addictive than acetaminophen or ibuprofen they're more powerful they have that effect now at the point he's making is that many people went over to Vietnam and in that context of war started doing drugs and when they came back they didn't do drugs anymore which might lead us to believe that the opioid addiction is not just a story about doctors writing scripts it's also a story about the big stories that we are nested within the vast majority of them spontaneously stop using the drug but but why chemical not in the body what's going on isn't there a biochemical lack and therefore a huge compulsion well think about it think about it in terms of existential learning see he just wrote agent arena on the whiteboard he doesn't always say what he writes on the whiteboard which is the downside of just listening to his stuff there's a podcast version this YouTube version but you just wrote agent arena on the board when they were in Vietnam they had a particular identity their soldier as an agent they were a soldier and they're in a particular arena war and the arena was war they're in a particular existential mode when they returned to the United States they become a citizen right and a peaceful country now someone start drinking and because well because the agent and the arena doesn't just evaporate and if you listen to Rhett and Link there's plenty of there's plenty of leftover from their formation even though the transformations that they're talking about in their links happen 2013 2014 if you can put to the degree that you can put dates on these kinds of things there's a lot going on here so you have you know I talked to the pastor from wasn't quite in Nova Scotia but you know talk to the pastor that we talked about post-traumatic stress and what it means to be a soldier and what it means to the warrior culture now you come back to Canada from from a warrior culture you're asked to change well this agent arena relationship is different talked about you know Tim Keller's illustration from his book preaching of of someone let's say someone who was a Viking versus someone who is a young man walking in New York City biologically there's a great degree of commonality between those two but the agent and the arena are in very different places and those arenas are very much going to determine what's going to happen at every level within the person the relationship between the agent in the arena is what is fundamentally being altered in addiction so Mark proposes a model that he calls reciprocal narrowing so here's your agent and here's the arena and what happens is the drug use is a suit is is associated with a particular agent arena relationship and what happens is and we talked about this before remember this is always co-identification we're always assuming an identity and assigning identity in a co-defining interdependent manner what happens is you start to lose a little bit of your cognitive flexibility perhaps due to something like this as you lose your cognitive flexibility the number of options in the world starts to decline now what do you mean you lose your cognitive flexibility again he's pointing to all the stuff that he had written in the part of the lecture before when I'm playing I'm not gonna play the whole lecture the whole lectures an hour long plus my commentary winds up being two hours whole video before hours then because I got another lengthy portion of video to play with Jordan Peterson and David Nasser lose cognitive flexibility what do you mean that the the menu of options that are before you has fewer items on it okay this is something that you see often in people when you talk to people through their problems people will often come to me and say I had no choice you had no choice what do you mean could you have said no no I couldn't say no why couldn't you say no then then she'd be mad at me oh that's not a choice that you're making so what if she's mad at you I don't want her to be mad at me oh so so what happens is the the options narrow and and what what happens in addiction is that the only choice becomes let's say to drink okay or to sleep on the foundation of the Lord right as the number of options start to decline you lose the variability for your agency as you get a tighter narrower less flexible cognitive agency the number of options in the world goes and what happens is these two things reciprocally narrow so so the option is oh I woke up this morning have a drink well the more you're drinking the more of your money is going into drinking your options are narrowing the time that you're spending drinking is is large on and on and on and on and on and on and on it can happen with computer games can happen with pornography can happen with relationships can happen with all kinds of things things just keep narrowing down and you lose your agency and he's drawing a little sort of a cone on the board that goes down to the bottom and until until at some point you're laying on the foundation of the Lord and you've got two modes your your your afternoon and evening all the way until probably two or three in the morning that mode is drug seeking and drug doing and then your other mode from two or three in the morning to eleven or the afternoon is sleeping it off those are your only two modes that's it reciprocal narrowing and and your whole life in fact just goes down down down down down down down and it's in a sense a death of sorts to where you have no options as to who you could be or how the world can be and that's addiction it is a learned not propositionally learned perspectively participatory learning of a loss of agency now this if you've been following the John Verbeke stuff you know that there are four peas and knowing and propositionally is is one of those four peas perspectival participatory whenever I get three I can never remember the four that's always a different at propositional perspectival procedural participatory those are his four ways of knowing if you go to my blog I've got them listed there maybe I'll remember to put the notes in if not and if you want it just leave me a comment and I'll drop a link in but one of the interesting things that you listen when you listen to a lot of these transformation these deconstruction videos is that especially for Christians coming out of an evangelical world propositional is a biggie okay it's a biggie now it's one of the four you're never gonna be without it it's always gonna be there it's a it's a vitally important level but again if you listen to the whole videos listening to this video again today I think I should just probably do a whole video or bring this video back up when I start to deal with the propositional level more directly because this isn't just true into Christianity he's demonstrating how it's worked in the history of Buddhism it's an important level but if if it gets disconnected or out of balance with the other levels things become a problem and I pointed out to mark that if this is the case that reciprocal narrowing that funnel court sort of whirlpool down down down that's what he did with his finger there must be an opposite if there's a spiral down there must be a spiral up and in personal communication just recently he said yes yes totally and you know what that spiraling up would be what would be the agent arena relationship in which the agency and the world are expanding that's an agagay now as job said something about you know for veki language you know for veki's barring from the Greeks there how does that fit in with with with Rhett and links story they're feeling that and if you listen to their story they're feeling that they're breaking out of Christianity is an agagay this is a this is a leveling up this is instead of going down into the filter down to nothingness or death they are going up and their world becomes larger their world becomes bigger there their menu of options become larger that's what they feel happening in them now is it true because here's part of the thing if you if you go into the rest of John's work we have what he calls now some of you will be offended at the language others of you don't care call call you know to use Harry Frank words both bullshitting you know we're fooling ourselves it feels like it's getting larger but it's actually getting smaller I can I'm a better driver when I drink you know are you really well I often find this with with conversations with people about pot is pop making your life better or worse it's not always necessarily an easy thing to tell because maybe they had pain maybe chronic pain made that trouble unwinding maybe they had trouble sleeping is how can you tell if pot is making their life better or worse well well probably whether or not in fact it's expanding but expanding how are you tracking this we're probably going to do it with respect to story with respect to one story within the context of other story because not only is the agent a story but the arena is a story and I'm not saying they're merely stories I'm saying that's the level at which we conceptualize them which we can dialogue through them back and forth that's what we're doing now John is about to connect this to the Buddhist story that's the move towards enlightenment what I want you to and there's a reason we're using light because if it's dark we don't have agency the arena is dark and the agent is helpless and lightning means turning on the light well now you can now you can be a far better agent within an arena and you can make your way through this part of the reason Buddhists talk about enlightenment enlightenment comes up the enlightenment in Western history read the Gospel of John Jesus is the light of the world this Sunday is Transfiguration Sunday Jesus Jesus shines like the Sun that's his transfiguration that's his transformation so so all of this stuff is connected understand is Dukkha is these two things because they're okay Dukkha is suffering in Buddhism and and so earlier in this video John's wanting to reinterpret or at least interpret or offer his interpretation of Buddhism in terms of what are we talking about when we're talking about all life is suffering interpenetrating this loss of agency because this this is your agency as you're simultaneously doing parasitic processing within you're doing reciprocal narrowing without those are totally reinforcing each other that's Dukkha and no matter where you turn this is always threatening you can't get free of that you can't run away from it you can't deny it remember the Buddha tried self-denial this is like trying to hop over your shadow you can't do it because it is endemic all of this is endemic this is the agent arena relationship you can't do away with this this is indispensable to be you being a person this is self organizing relevance realizing complexifying processing you can't get away from that because that is what makes you adaptive so what do you an adaptivity gives you agency in multiple arenas and that's what the Buddha meant when you realize that all of your life is threatened by Dukkha he didn't mean believe that all of life is suffering that's the propositional level so okay that's what I'm going to play from the video if you're interested in now I want to make a comment about using John's work and using Buddhism because I know for a lot of Christians that get a little reactive to that I think it's helpful to use these illustrations from other religions because we're not as bound up in all of our history we can in sense see them with a little bit more objectivity perhaps because we can watch similar dynamics going on in them as we have in our own or religious arenas okay so I think that's part of the reason why why this is helpful so John talks about the agent arena relationship and talks about the fact that what we can understand addiction as a narrowing and then we can understand enlightenment now this word very interestingly is used by Buddhism it's used by the West in terms of the enlightenment and and what was understood by that enlightenment is not a narrowing but an expanding and and and Rhett and Link see the transformation that they have undergone as an expanding and if you listen to both of their stories as they tell their own stories these are the kinds of terms that they use they feel more free they feel less constrained that is how that that is how they are perceiving it now to evaluate it as we're gonna get into a little bit later in the video is actually remarkably difficult because I might feel let's say I I decide that I am let's say Adderall let's say I decide well I'm going to start taking Adderall because I've always been ADHD they didn't really have that language when I was in school I wasn't on Ritterland so I'm gonna take Adderall and I start taking Adderall and I can talk about the transformational effects that Adderall have on me and I feel like I can get more work done I feel like I can concentrate better I feel like I can there's a really fun documentary on Netflix about about Adderall and you know things are going really well things are going really great well is that really gonna be just an expanding thing because maybe Adderall works for me in time but later maybe it won't just you know see the problem with doing these abridged and longer versions is I never remember because I just do it all in one sitting I never remember which one I I actually made the comment in but you know I mentioned how want to lose weight want to eat better well sometimes I get in a habit of drinking a soda in the late afternoon I'm not a coffee drinker so I don't take caffeine in the morning and I don't drink alcohol so I don't a lot of people are on that take caffeine in the morning take alcohol at night and so you're using those tools to sort of manage your day you might feel like that is that is enlightening it is expanding your agency it is it is it is making your life a better thing so but sometimes in the afternoon I'll you know I've been working for a while I'm not as sharp as I was in the morning so then I will drink a soda have some caffeine and boom yeah I'm starting to get my work done well maybe with Adderall whoosh now now we're really doing something caffeine is one thing Adderall is another but things that I notice after I once I start getting into this soda habit well a few weeks will go by and I'll notice okay I really shouldn't drink be drinking the soda I've gotten off of diet sodas because I noticed that you know drinking those things some of those sweeteners they're not very good for you so then you know there's a particular Pepsi that has cane sugar you can drink Mexi coke that you can get at Costco with with cane sugar and instead of the high fructose corn syrup and but then I realized that I'm drinking a soda every day I really shouldn't drink that soda so okay so now I'm gonna get off the and you know what the next day comes around and three o'clock hits and it's like a little bit of a headache my body is conditioned to having that soda and not only my body I've talked to some people have tried to quit smoking you know smoking in Facebook for a friend of mine they just go together and so when she finally had to quit smoking it was really hard and you know smokers always deal with these kinds of things but and so again if I take Adderall it might feel in the moment like enlightenment like I can get more work done like everything is better like my horizons are opening but over a certain amount of time I might discover that that wasn't really the case or it was temporarily case again these things are very difficult to figure out and we use stories to track them now I'm gonna play quite a bit of the video of Jordan Peterson's conversation with David Nasser now this happened when Jordan Peterson went and visited Convocation at Liberty University and there was an event that happened there those videos have been out for quite a while the talk with David Nasser was really interesting they first begin talking about suicide because the person who rests the stage because he wanted to meet Jordan Peterson was struggling with suicide but then they eventually got into what I think is the far more interesting part of Jordan Peterson's work which is again is all about transformations but trying to figure out the relationship between internal transformation my agency within and the degree that the arena functions like an agency or the degree to which we conceptualize the re the arena as agency and the way that that actually helps in terms of breaking addiction in terms of an agag a as as verveky would call it in terms of enlightenment in terms of extending my horizons of being a better person and actually most of this conversation is germane to this so again if you're watching the abridged version if you want to see the rest of the version the link to the main videos the original videos are in the show notes the and expanded version will be on the same channel I'm releasing them the same day so let's start that video this is doctor Jordan Peterson one last question it's it's not on Jordan Peterson's YouTube channel it's on the Liberty University YouTube channel and again I'll put the link to it in the notes below they were just talking about suicide and now this is a really fun video to play in the context of Rhett and Link because David Nassar would be exactly the kind of not exactly but close enough to the religious context that Rhett and Link have grown out of and so David Nassar's agenda is in fact Christian conversion and what's fun about him talking to Jordan Peterson is Jordan Peterson isn't exactly on that same agenda but he's adjacent to it and he's conversant in it but now they're going to be talking about addiction and basically the agency of the individual and the conceptualized agency of the arena now of course for David Nassar the agency of the arena if you look at my videos about the Medi-Divine realm versus say God the agency of the arena for David Nassar is in fact God for Jordan Peterson he's more of an agnostic I usually call him an open agnostic okay but and that's what makes this conversation fun because Jordan Peterson the real insight was the real thing that Jordan Peterson did was re-conceptualize God to a whole generation of young men which became which suddenly made them interested in what if it's exactly this is more than a conceptualization and this is exactly why rationality rules has a problem because he sort of opens the door to the conceptualization and lots of people say I don't want to just I don't want to just go to the movies and watch Star Wars I want to live in that universe and that too is is very very human so so David Nassar is gonna start by doing the pastor thing if you're pastor you can see a lot of pastor tricks and what David Nassar is doing in this video as as a pastor what I say to a student who is overwhelmed when they see a giant that's bigger than them again the conceptualization when they're overwhelmed what are they overwhelmed by they're overwhelmed by their class they're overwhelmed by all these things they see a giant that's bigger than them that's powerful stuff it's an image it's a story it's something that's viral something that's relatable can pastors major in this stuff instead of saying that's not a giant you know instead of discounting you know pain or minimizing but notice how they're using stories to manage the complexity of their lives we do that all the time I go you know what that's bigger than you yeah but it's not bigger than God and okay well what's God God is the everything so that's bigger than here's little you this is bigger than you but it's not bigger than God that's a powerful story and and you'll watch religious and unreligious and non-religious people conceptualize this way now again in religious terms well this is exercising faith in Jordan Peterson terms this is this is working psychology is that one or the other and I know it sounds like a cliche sermon little zinger but we just say yeah we I don't even pretend that you have the power on yours on your own to slay this Goliath in your life but we believe that you know God hasn't left you as a matter of fact in this very dark hour that's when he's closest to you and so we're not looking for you to do this in your looking for you to do this you know and the power of the one who died on the cross for you okay right there your power or not basically the power of the arena hmm but but is that power in the arena and do I do I can I really interface with that power through all the kinds of things that Christianity or other religions tell me I can interface with that through that power with this are we giving people false hope well now Nasser turns and says now I'm gonna jump into the secular sphere and say is all this BS is this really true watch Jordan Peterson's answer we do that as Christian counselors are we oh wait oh we Jordan Peterson asked does it work and David Nasser says it doesn't work all the time right it doesn't work all the time but it does work sometimes and again I think you're right sometimes I'm talking to someone who literally needs because of a chemical imbalance these medication and it's not chemical imbalance okay now we're gonna jump over into the medical field we're gonna talk about the chemical field because well Christians understand that we're both as hey here's sermon and then they're good and it's chiropractic to what I mean by that is you don't adjust and then it's fine you know you have to adjust again and adjust again that they keep continuing to go to counseling and continue to get help pastors are masters of images successful pastors know know how to work story and image to help people work through to do help people do anagag a to help them get out of the reciprocal narrowing and get into the the expansion the the enlightenment that's what that's what pastors jobs it's a dance it's two steps forward most people have a relationship with the transcendent like we're remarkable creatures and I think for us to call on that relationship in times of dire need is perfectly appropriate and and you're providing people with the language for doing that no I mean there is a lot of potential locked up inside of each person and the precise nature of that potential is unknown it's often referred to in religious language and to let someone know that there's more that they can call on that they may then they may have yet called on I think can be extraordinarily useful if people can walk down that path now he did exactly what rationality rules complains about right there because this is what Jordan Peterson does he walks that line and says well there they can call on more than they know well where is that more coming from and Jordan's an agnostic so he's he's reluctant to say the more he's reluctant to talk about the ontology see even that he's reluctant to talk about the he's walking that line because he says well if it's if it's manifesting in reality if it works there's something to it but where is the source of that something is it the individual psychological is the is it the intersubjective is it and you know now he's a union so there's a lot of layers to to that that union conceptualization that Jordan Peterson is obviously well aware of but you know this is but this is exactly the line that Jordan Peterson is very interested in and it's exactly the line that almost everybody's very interested in because we want stories of transformation and we want stories of positive transformation and we want to know where can we find the power for transformation and where can we find the power to level up look at the language what about those who maybe aren't suicidal but are in a place where they're just overwhelmed with mistake after mistake after mistake in their life and it's where they're just overwhelmed with mistake after mistake in their life and they're just looking for a first step out what advice would you give them well I think partly what you do under those circumstances is you do a little bit of meditation you know and and you decide first that you want your life to be better you want a transformation you know that that that it's that it would be acceptable in the sight of God and the universe if your life was okay if you were doing well conceptualizing again the arena as an agent as a person who has opinions and will okay now again for Peterson this is this is on the line of psychology that this is a conceptualization this is a representation but that representation in fact is powerful and then you concentrate on what you could do what you could stop doing that's not good for you you know and and of course the rationality rule well he never gives he never he only gives declarative he never gives normative now he just he's just given a whole bunch of normative things as a as Adam friend had pointed out in his video about destiny I think that's that's a repentance in some sense and I'm speaking about it I would say in a psychological sense rather than a technically religious sense it's like it's easy to sit on the edge of your bed and to think look there are things I'm doing there are things I'm not doing that I should be doing that I could and would do small things you don't want to get grandiose but you can you can start to improve your life incrementally by eliminating those things that are self-evidently making you bitter and miserable but you have to decide that that's what you want you're willing to burn off that deadwood to sacrifice that bitterness and that unhappiness even though you may feel that you're justified in in in in harboring it you may even be justified in harboring it because people have very hard lives and sometimes they're very badly mistreated you need to think it's okay if things improve and it would be worthwhile for me to start to abandon my well you could say my sin my failure to make the mark right my failure to take proper aim but to abandon those things that I'm doing that I know to be harmful to myself so Peterson's talking about a transformation and the transformation that Peter is admonishing as a transformation that many people who have followed Jordan Peterson have taken they've read 12 rules for life they've cleaned up their room they've stood up straight with their shoulders back they've pet a cat they've they've they've tried to stop to tell the truth or at least stop lying they have tried to do what is meaningful rather than what it's what's expedient they Peterson has been all about transformation what would you say to pastors who think well why would you stop short of trying to get them to self-help or try to get them to when you could go even further with them not just only deal with the symptoms and those things but just actually then provide them a faith that well with okay now now again look at what David Nassar is doing anybody who's familiar with evangelical Christianity knows exactly what David Nassar is doing and Rhett and Link would listen to what David and Nassar is doing and I don't know what they would do because I haven't listened to them hardly at all you know recall recoil or what have you but but now again the arena for David Nassar is quite full and real quite active and so what pastors should give them something else well how do you give them that thing well you you you tell them the gospel or you do something like this bigger than that. If you're a pastor you probably should ask that question I mean the the issue is the issue in a situation like that is that you have to govern your response to the person in accordance with that person you know you have to see where they're willing to go next like and you want to make sure that your destination which might be or your arena which could be let's say your pride in your role in their salvation right for example or BSing that would be your pride I mean your your filter doesn't get in the way of see but but right away what you're seeing is the arenas are moving around here which arena is it and then they're not on they're not necessarily on the same page or definitely not on the same page but that they're conversant at least good enough to at least be able to have this conversation and make progress and find some places in the middle to meet. Oh yeah. Doesn't interfere with your careful noticing of what it is that they need right here and now. And so now need again is another thing so what does Billy out there need right now maybe he needs me to go out there and pick him up out of this stinky sleeping bag and throw him against the wall and say you're wasting your life. Does that help? I'd probably scare him pretty good. Don't think he'd respond positively that maybe I should leave him alone maybe I should get a homeless navigator from the city of Sacramento to try and connect him with services and well maybe and Jordan Peterson says don't forget the observer in this maybe I'm thinking you know I'm gonna do this I'm gonna talk about this and this is gonna elevate my status in the eyes of some maybe you know I can save Billy and well maybe maybe I'll get Billy sober but then maybe Billy won't come to my church maybe Billy will come to my church on and on and on. So I've got to watch myself in this thing but but Peterson's saying now you're looking for the good but again that good for the other is also there's some commonality in terms we want the good to be opening but but even the as I talked about a bit about before even the interpretation of the opening is also within a context so so this stuff gets really complicated. And so you you you you want to push people to their limit but but to their genuine limit right but you don't want to tear the fabric of trust like no and then you don't want to make them you don't want to make them into puppets of your desire you can lead people but you can't you can't let's say you can't remake them like it you can lead them and and to lead someone appropriately you need to know where they are and that means you have to pay attention and I would say well for some people the religious approach initially might be the right one there's some evidence for that for example in the treatment of alcoholism I mean the alcoholism literature indicates quite clearly that perhaps the only effective known treatment for alcoholism is actually religious conversion I mean sometimes people stop of their own accord and we don't exactly understand why but religious conversion actually seems to be quite effective and it isn't clear why the 12-step people capitalize on that. Now again talking about the agent arena relationship from the verveki video that we just watched we even have this built into our language he drove her to drink I was listening to the the Aaron Rodgers transformation video and what does Aaron Rodgers do when he loses a game he drinks well what is what is the relationship I'm not saying Aaron Rodgers is an alcoholic and I'm not part of a tradition that says drinking is always wrong but what's the relationship between Aaron Rodgers losing a football game and Aaron Rodgers drinking it's not biochemical it's it's something else going on and this is part of verveki's point that addiction is not just chemical reactions and Jordan Peterson now notes that actually if you want to deal with the chemical of alcohol and the influence it's playing in someone's life you're probably going to have to deal with what we call their life which is their story and there hasn't been good scientific studies of the effectiveness of the 12-step program because it's hard to do controlled studies but well because because I think I sat with a gentleman one time who who is a 12-step program guru he travels the world so he said hey wait what what are you doing and I saw my travel and speak and he said oh I travel and speak and I told he said what are you going to and I said I'm going to this church and I'm you know gonna go this notice how David Nassar was using the the the secular language what do you do I travel and speak and if you talk to a church person I I'm a traveling evangelist I travel and speak you probably also eat and sleep and and read and think all those things to travel and sleep relevance realization here preach and he said I'm going to a rally and alcoholics anonymous route and he pulled out his coin and he said you know I've been sober and he gave me the days was a long time and he said and I said well how do you begin I said yes ma'am sorry said you began I said I always began with the word I always open up the Bible to make sure I'm not you know that's the foundation of anything I have to okay so now here's his arena now now obviously the Bible and you get into Rhett and Link yeah the Bible is a big deal Bible is especially Protestant theology Bible is Bible is the foundation and now all of this imagery is going to come into David Nassar's conceptualization of this and watch how Jordan Peterson sort of works to translate it yeah people ultimately don't need my opinion they need the truth I don't and he said I always began with the same this is interesting he said I always began with hi my name is and I am an alcoholic he says because we believe once an alcoholic always an alcoholic and I said you haven't taken a drink in 1,100 days or whatever he said he said yeah he said I teach people he said but we believe one I said that's the difference for us we as believers believe I once was lost but now I'm found I once was salt but I'm Paul I once was an alcoholic but now I have a new identity so are we just preaching to our some please be just very honest with me is that oh we just know how they're in get up and preaching that to ourselves because we've seen the evidence of saying to someone when Christ gives you a new identity you can identity what are the most important words you're gonna hear LGBT stuff okay identity what what happened when there's there's an author Melinda Sellers I think her name is she has a hilarious article the game Roman Emperor gene you know where the Roman Emperor's gay well they'd have sex with men and were they pedophiles some of them would have sex with children they'd have sex with men were where the little where the boys or were they were the Greek tutors who had sex with their pupils were they gay now what happens when you take something like that you have an identity or Christian let's use that one Christian the identity is in many ways you might think well the identity is the agent no the identity is a relevance realization move between the agent and the arena the identity is something in between the agent and the arena and John Verbeke noted that in his video when he said the soldier is at war and the citizen the war in the foreign country and the citizen is at peace in their home country okay so the identity has everything to do with the context and and now the context here is well alcohol or the context here is the far broader sin and so I am an alcoholic that's context within alcohol I am a sinner saved by grace let's say to use Christian language the context is an entire story it's the agent arena relationship you're no longer because we've seen the evidence of saying to someone when Christ gives you a new identity you can you're no longer a slave to the things that you are slave to you're now a slave to righteousness now growing in that identity doesn't mean there's not a struggle doesn't mean there's not temptation that you can fall into and understand your weak points I think it's more of a cautionary technique on the part of the 12 step people they assume so so Jordan now wants to nuance well you know okay let's not push the you know hi my name is Paul and I'm an alcoholic I'm always in our once you know once saved always saved you hear Rhett and Link talk about that once alcoholic always alcoholic and Jordan Peterson saying yeah but that's it that's a technique I think he's right that alcohol especially for people who are really susceptible to alcoholism is sufficiently powerful so that some people can't risk any relapse and I think that's true with alcohol it it's it's a very dangerous drug and I think that that is true for a minority of people there are studies of alcoholic recovery where the people learn to drink moderately and there's been a huge debate in the alcoholism treatment literature about whether total abstinence or modified drinking is more effective and I haven't looked at that literature for a long time it's been decades I would say but the last time I did look the argument still hadn't been settled but it's quite clear that for some people alcohol is so dangerous that it's safer for them to assume that they don't have the wherewithal to make a single error but remember they're talking about something that's a fairly focal part of their life right they say well I have this one overwhelming temptation and I have to treat it with with with tremendous respect your question is more about personality transformation in general and and how it plays out even into the trenches of addictions I mean I'm a Christian I became a Christian when I was 18 my addictions didn't didn't stop you know tempting me you know and it's not just even the things that I that I had before I became a Christian I've had I've added new new temptations as a believer trust me they don't go away but rather than tapping into self-power or tapping into even good things like the accountability of a community and those kind of things for me it's in so inside out I just have to continue to preach to myself well it's a funny I'm acting in contradiction to my new identity when I succumb to it and I do succumb to it sometimes but when I do I have to tell myself I just acted in contradiction to my new identity okay so there you see the interrelationship between the agent and the arena that's where identity is okay and what he's saying is that there's there's a relationship there and the the agent isn't acting so the identity isn't a self is in a sense a second self and he wants to live up into this second self he wants to become this new identity all right so the identity isn't just a given thing or a found thing it's also an aspirational thing and it's very much in context with the arena not as a compliment to my new identity so so as a Christian I mean you're called upon ethically to act in a Christian manner yes sir and so there's obviously some assumption that your voluntary actions are part and parcel of an ethical requirement and also part and parcel of the faith but then there's also the the core correlated claim that the salvation is through Christ see now Jordan this is what Jordan's very interested in and you saw when he wanted to interrupt but Nasser wouldn't let him in you got if you're having a conversation with Jordan Peterson on video you gotta be really careful ask go look at go look at the first Sunday special by Ben what is it Shapiro that's it Peterson's very interested in this because here's the question of agency is the agency just below or is the agency above and and one of the things that you see in the retin the retin link conversations is that the agency of the community they felt was a little bit too domineering going to Los Angeles you could really hear this in links they're sort of free they could sort of you know ease off and they have this freedom to do their transformation but now Peterson is saying well where's this agency coming from is it the individual is it the the individual's agency or is agency in the arena because in many ways again if you look at the metaphysical realm versus the god dichotomy that I keep pointing to that's the question that Peterson's very interested in pointing to that's the question that Peterson's very interested in because that's the that's the the agnostic says I don't know I don't I don't know if I can choose between the metaphysical realm and a god which is a person and has agency and all of those things that's something Jordan's very interested in and so he sees this tension in Christianity in fact he sees it more clearly a lot of Christians see it he wants to kind of probe this and explore this with David Nasser because where is the power in the agency coming from and so there's a there's a there's a there's a funny contradiction there that's difficult to reconcile which is that on the one hand it's the action of something transcendent that's leading you out of perdition but god jesus but on the other hand you're still called upon to act as voluntarily as an active agent and so faith and works it's a long conversation in Christianity of course it's a very tricky business to separate out how much you put on the person let's say Calvinism versus Arminianism this is up to you this is your responsibility to draw the bull back and to hit the target properly and how much you attribute to the grace of god that allows that to occur and so I came I was a Muslim you know before I became a Christian and before it was always the responsibility was there you know it's hey as a responsible religious person here's the list of dues and here's the list of don'ts and by the way they were all good for me you know those lists of dues were like don't they were good dues and the list of don'ts were you know they were not evil they were actually for my benefit they have a lot more than 12 rules you've got a lot of rules and even on the Old Testament side there's over 600 dues and don'ts of the Mosaic law but it was no longer for me responsibility is reimagined in the life of a believer and that it's my response to his ability and so responsibility is now that I'm a Christian I'm responsible to love my neighbor to love the neighbor to love the lord with my heart soul mind and strength first of all I'm going to fail at that so Christ has already done it for me he's the perfect model second I'm walking in obedience not to earn his favor but because I've already been given and so I feel like the power has been put in me that's resurrection power so now if you go through David Nassar's talk here he's he's he's he's looking at the storified theology of this interrelationship between the agent and the arena but the arena of course is highly personalized and the agent is both a a recipient of grace which is something that is between them that's something the arena does to the agent and you know so he's laying this out here now I've just got to walk it out we've got to flesh it out I've got to grow in it by the way I say that yeah so that's already see and right there because well what is I and that's what Jordan Peterson wants to know and if you go back to Michelle Williams who is basically saying I want to have control of my story and Jordan Peterson is too good of a psychologist too good of a clinical psychologist to just let that thing well what is you where does that come from that is not that is by no means as simple and as easy and as low resolution thing as Michelle Williams wants to imagine because you are formed and in many ways this is what's going on with Rhett and Link they're working through this stuff they're trying to find who they are my wife and I've been watching this Netflix show Love is Blind and it's interesting because now my wife and I've been married 32 years and over we had a little getaway list last weekend and she said we've been married 11,511 days so happy anniversary 11,511 and and so now we're up to like 515 11,515 days together but what and everyone in that Love is Blind show says I want to be loved for who I am but the more you watch the show these are people mostly in their 20s and 30s some of them quite dramatically well you don't know who you are because you are a lot inside and there's a lot outside and actually understanding what the line is between inside and outside not so clear and if you want to see that's not so clear go to another culture and look at their outside and their inside in fact we always do this quite dismissively with other people well if you were born in a Muslim country you'd be a Muslim well if you were born to Muslim parents you'd be a Muslim whereas Dave Nasser is born to Muslim parents now he's a Christian minister at Liberty University what's going on with that well it's because he moved to North Carolina yeah probably but but where's the inside and where's the outside and so when you listen to Rhett and Link there's a lot of those questions these they're not they're a little bit older they're in their 40s now but I'm in my 50s we're all still working through those things these things don't go away because we just see people as bound by skin and but remember we're stories and the story outside and the story inside we're always working this and and they go together and this is exactly why people are nervous about these Christian influencers because they're relating stories out there and that's going to have impact on other stories so it's going to change us and so it's all about the competition of the stories and that's what Jordan Peterson's getting at so no wait a minute wait a minute how does this story work again that's a funny one too because that's that same contradiction is that that and so so I mean when I'm thinking about these things metaphysically I think um so there's a Christian idea that Christ died on the cross to save us from our sins and to redeem the world and I think well one of the things Carl Jung pointed out was that part of the reason the the the enlightenment emerged was because there was observations in Christendom that there was still a lot of redemption that seemed to need to occur despite the fact that this miraculous event had manifested itself and so you have this contradiction that the redemption has already taken place but there's still all the problems in the world and so the way that I've reconciled that to myself conceptually speaking metaphysically is that well the the death and resurrection of Christ it has to do with with it this is kind of fun because what Jordan Peterson's trying to do is reconcile predestination and individual agency and it's and he's going to use time to do it it's kind of fun watching him you know work work on this very interesting puzzle that theologians have been chewing on for hundreds of years different the the death and resurrection of Christ it has to do with with a different concept of time I suppose is the death and resurrection of Christ has redeemed the world but we still have work to do and that those two things can can be together I mean the logos has always been regarded as something up David Ness like yeah I know this problem we talked about it for a long time outside of time right it's it's it's outside of the past and the present and the future and encompasses all of that and so in some sense something there's a level of analysis outside of time where something could have already been accomplished but within time which is where we are well there's still plenty to do and it seems to me that I the reason I'm stating that that's a metaphysical statement is because well it's it's complicated and paradoxical but it seems to me to be correct is that there's a there's a pathway laid out it it manifests itself to us at least in part in the voice of our conscience and in in in our knowledge of our ethical responsibility and well in our knowledge of good and evil and the the ideal the redemptive ideal is there to beckon and to call and to aid us notice the agency the ideal is to beckon and to call to aid us now is that metaphorical language is that is is the ideal actually a more than just an abstraction or representation is it actually an agency how would we know whether or not it's in its agency because we certainly relate to it as an agency and in fact we can't help but talk to it in those terms but there's no complacency there's still the battle that we each have to undertake and you can see this tension within Christianity itself you know because the orthodox Christians for example place a lot more emphasis in my understanding on that action of the individual the attempt to become christ-like in in action and attitude and let I don't think this is quite where Peterson thinks it is but because it has a lot to do with the conversation I had with Brett Salkald about sacramentality because this is where really it begins to interface with the the meaning crisis and what and of course in Christianity what is with that bread and the wine how how does it work work less on on the action of the individual the attempt to become christ-like in in action and attitude and less on the turning over of the redemptive process to the to the to the redemptive figure and so the protestants and the orthodox have been arguing about that for a long time absolutely and I don't know how to rectify that yes I don't of course you don't it's really hard I think Jesus is trying to redeem the world around me I don't think Jesus wants to know I'd have my conversation with David Nassar about this conceptualization save America I think he wants to save Americans I don't think Jesus is going to fix Canada you know he wants he died for Canadians and so it's the he died for squirrels too you can find that on a an old sermon way way before this thing individual right now if God's redemptive power is in me and it's working through me and so so all of a sudden the way I see my okay now again this what happens is God's redemptive power is in me it's working through me now this is this is obvious this is going to be this is going to be very Christian move here this is Christian theology happening and and of course there's going to be some issues about individually I mean this is enormously complex but he's giving you know this is basically the Christian answer a neighbor the way I treat people with dignity even if they don't treat me with dignity the way that I showed the fruit of the spirit the evidence of the Holy Spirit living in me certainly that's going to drop the crime rate if more people are doing that certainly there's going to be evidence of a bit of a turnaround in a community if a bunch of people in that community have the power of God and living in and through them but that said it's certainly not going to be religion I mean the most messed up places in the world I'm from Iran trust me most messed up places in the world are the most religious places in the world so for me it's more about this Christ living in someone and then the rest of it fleshing out it's also your willingness to replace your current personality with an ideal personality transformation there we go back on topic you know and that might be and that might be a very that might be a very productive way of thinking about it is that there's the you that exists now like you know many psychologists will tell young people that they're okay the way they are and I never do that I always say well you're nowhere near what you could be you love them too much to well it's all the truth it's it's just not appropriate to tell someone who's young that they're okay the way they are because they have 60 years to be far better at who they are than they are now and they need that adventure and I think part of that I think psychologically speaking part of that language that goes along with the idea of having Christ inhabit you let's say and then having him work through you is the decision that you're going to turn yourself over to the ideal and then allow that to act through you to the degree that that's possible okay so transformation there's this ideal self but there's the ideal and again Peterson's a Jungian so there's the ideal self but that ideal self is Christ and of course retinoling know all this language they were raised into it you know to grow up into Christ but that Christ is not they're not going to grow up to be a first century you know construction worker they're going to grow up to be an ideal self which is which is Christ in them and you know that's transformation and this is the this is the transformation that everybody wants in many ways to to grow up to become your best self but what do you mean by best and then that ideal is fleshed out in this figure of the person it's the person of the Holy Spirit is who I would turn and by the way it's a daily work Bible says you know deny yourself if any man wishes to come after me deny yourself pick up the cross daily and follow me yes well and that's and that's well that's I have to die every day that's also the part that's well that's the part that's so much associated with responsibility like that dying and again I would speak psychologically here is that look we all have preconceptions of the world and in some sense we have the whole world mapped out and much of our map isn't accurate and it's low resolution and now this is really pertinent to the retin-link thing they had a mapping of the world and what happened was they saw some other mappings of the world that seemed more compelling so they have to update their map that's the process that they're undergoing in transformation you get some of the later verveky videos and you recognize that the world is far larger and more complex than any human mind can map even when we work together what do we do with that well we have to keep mapping but we can't just live in uncertainty and so here's where you get the ian mcgillchrist you have you have the part of the brain that's dealing with the new stuff and you have the part of the brain that's dealing with the mapped and so it's always the interchange between those two things and so these transformations are always happening okay and and they have to happen now there's going to be boundary lines and tribal lines and propositional lines all over the place that we're going to sort of use to try to keep track of each other because we want to know what each other is doing because we have to do that in order to live together because we really don't like certain kinds of surprises okay to have your wife come home and one day and say surprise i've had an affair for 30 years that's not the kind of surprise people want to hear um to have your kid come home and say surprise i oh yeah there's a lot of things go through my mind i won't mention any of them but you can fill in your own so this is all what we're doing and so this process of transformation is constantly going on really and it should be but what we want to figure out is if our new mappings are better but again this gets back into the thing well would adderall be a new and improved mapping for me well some might say yes some might say no i tend to think no and so i'm not pursuing adderall but these are the kinds of things that we're dealing with it needs updating but what it means is that when we learn something new instead of merely adding something new to something we already know we have to let something we thought we knew die and have it replaced and that's that daily death and resurrection that's part of it is that is to be acutely aware of your errors which i think you do if you try to act out an ideal right you see where you fall short i think if i try to figure out where i am on the map or self-evaluate i tend to lie to myself i'm really good at telling myself i'm okay so now we're getting into verveki's larger project this is all the ways we fool ourselves and if i'm evaluating me by myself i need another standard outside well he'll say i don't need a psychologist to tell me i'm fine but if i just put my life up against the word of god you know okay that's what they're using but now again if you listen to especially link's second talk when he's saying well the word of the bible is a big book and so what we tend to do is focus it down into certain relevant rules so growing up you know don't have sex with your girlfriend don't drink uh don't lie go to church you take that you really huge listen you bring it down to certain rules and then but but but now that's going to be involved in your mapping and and link tells a story about going to a party and getting drunk and telling rat and then they they work that out and you know there's this is this is a constant part of the process that's going on but we're always looking both for some standard by which we can measure ourself that is not subject to our will and looking at ourself to try and see if we're doing that and we desperately need other people in part in part of this involved in that process if i look i and if i have community that's willing to tell me the truth even if it's not what i want to hear it's what i need to hear they tell my wife is the number one person in my life does that then then people that know me they go man your life isn't consistent with what you preach and what you believe and so i'm daily coming before community of accountability right i'm daily looking at the word of god and i'm daily asking the holy spirit to reveal to me the places that i need to grow and it's funny you're allowing the ideal to hold you accountable yes sir and i feel honestly dr pritchett i've been a christian i got i got saved when i was 18 by the way i got saved for myself you know that's why i feel like looking back on it god saved me from me and so um because i was sitting on the throne of my life but when i became a christian sir it i'm gonna tell you i was committing i was a pothead it wasn't even good pot i would smoke pot i would mix it with oregano and sell to my friends a thomas italian pot i was even an honest crook you know i was an alcoholic there's so much everything in my life was broken i was completely addicted to porn completely addicted to me completely bankrupted every as a bonfire of vanity i mean everything and then so he needed a transformation christ saved me and mine notice the language okay boom he was he was the recipient of something mouth i called my youth pastor and said i f-ing got saved and he said he saves your heart but still got to work on your math yeah and then he started discipling me and working with me and it's funny experience like what was this what was so again peterson peterson is a clinical psychologist really questions you know is curiously interested in transformations and and willing to go to a place like this to learn the transformative experience like it's dying it's dying the self and and it's understanding the exchange you know it's not changing your life people think christianity is change it's not it uh the change life is religion here's here's stuff you need to change the exchange life you know it's not another little pastor trick right here not changing it to me change is taking the the old man and putting makeup on it uh exchange is if if any man is in christ the bible says behold behold means what's happening internally is beheld on the other little pastor trick external evidence of of the internal behold he's a new creation as a new creation means i'm not taking the old and cleaning it up i'm taking the old and it's dead bringing it to the end of itself because i didn't need makeup i didn't need a haircut i needed open heart surgery i need a full new heart and so then walking into that is growing into that and by the way it's a dance what precipitate but i've got to tell you i feel i feel more sinful today than i did when i first became a christian because a sign of now this point if you listen to i'm not going to play clips from it in this video but if you listen to link you'll hear him working through many of these different things because again that they're both in very similar systems nasser comes in as an 18 year old from iranian refugees converts from islam to christianity rett link raised in christianity and now no longer identifying as christians remember identity is is is something in between the agent and the arena it's a public thing that is in many ways negotiated in public spiritual growth for me is that i'm more sensitive to the sins in my life so it's not that i'm like committing these massive meaning on the scale of like that's partner reginald for example that's right it's it's i think literally growing in christ is not that i stop sinning it's just my sensitivity to as you grow in your love affair with your wife it's not so much that like uh it's wow it's no longer just good enough to just be faithful as far as physically it's i'm going to be faithful and really paying greater attention to what she's saying i'm going to be more sensitive and so as i'm growing i sometimes feel like oh i'm a wretched sinner and i look back and it's stuff i wasn't even convicted about a few yet a few years ago and that can't be me because no part of the flesh now when he says convicted he means personally convicted not convicted in a court of law just to be clear ever desires that that and that can't be me because no part of the flesh now they're getting back to the the agency of the arena that so that can't be me so he's he's you know jordan peterson understanding it metaphorically david nasser understanding it with a bit more we see we don't even have the word um that that that that this is this is something this is a power coming in on me and again this is this is more similar to say the greeks i'm being possessed by aphrodite because i see this woman i'm being i'm possessed by the spirit of alcohol because i want to have a drink i mean this is it's that type of language and it's a again it's a move within the agent arena relationship and but but christians don't understand this as a loss of agency they understand this as an expansion of agency ever desires that that has to be the lord and so i'm just explaining where where it's coming from for for someone and um that's not to discount the help that people are getting from a great book like yours you know i i love your book so much i probably pass it out like tic tacs you know like to everybody but i wish it wasn't 34 bucks but you passed it out like tic tacs i wish it wasn't 34 bucks dude you gotta find it cheaper somewhere get it in bulk i pass it out because i think it really helps people and i love everything but the subtitle says you know that's an antidote to chaos i just think man i need these 12 rules but i don't know how that's an antidote to the chaos in my heart because you could keep adding rules and i'm still at the very best i've just learned how to clean up the chaos oh yes but it's still under the current the rules themselves are certainly insufficient to eradicate the chaos it's the it's the the rules are well you talked about discipline as in as in disciple i mean partly what you do to straighten yourself out so that you can deal with the transformations of life on an ongoing basis in a manner that's not overly rule bound is that you bind yourself with rules enough to become somewhat disciplined so that you can become a spontaneous ethical actor the rule part the relationship between the rules and the anagagai okay and in other words the rules are a tool to afford the anagagai because now i'm talking verveki uh the it's a good word for it that the rules are the rules are there to afford the the expansion the the the growth of agency the rules are there to afford the enlightenment they're helping us scale up by narrowing some of the other things that are that are that are going to disrupt the progress part is the rule part i don't have a problem with first of all i came from a religion that was very much like here are the rules second i came from a home being iranian where i learned to submit to authority third uh you know but the but the intent behind it changed you know i understand even before i was a christian i understood i need boundaries without boundaries no river with without banks is a river it's just a puddle so i knew the power of rules and boundaries in my life but now it's no longer doing to earn it's not it's not about doing to earn his favor it's about getting that favor for free by what christ has done misery deliverance gratitude and then every day just letting that become an evidence of of my faith and so you're accounting in part and the faith is accounting in part for the presence of that ideal that can move in to replace what was there before okay so peterson back on this question of the the agency of the arena so faith is just literally me trusting you know him even though i don't see it all and i don't have to know it all yeah well that's very much akin to the idea of trust in truth you know because truth gets people in trouble very frequently in the short term um but one one of the things i learned a long time ago was that it was very interesting to live your life by attempting to tell the truth because extraordinarily adventurous things occurred as a consequence it's like the short-term consequence might be all sorts of scandal and it frequently is because to tell the truth often means to say things that people would rather not hear but i do believe that and and this is an element of faith and i think it's akin to exactly what you're describing is that i've decided that i'm going to do my best to tell the truth on the assumption that no matter what it looks like to me right now there isn't a better outcome than the outcome that's generated as a consequence of telling the truth yes right and that's definitely something that i think has to be placed into the category of faith it's rational because you you got to think well better to have reality behind you than confronting you you know and maybe if you tell the truth you at least have the real on your side that's something yes but you but again notice with peterson too with with the truth i mean the regia is the arena is um it's given an agency in here and so we're always dealing with with the relationship between those two you certainly can pay a high price for that in the present and i think that idea of faith in christ is analogous to that i mean there's there's a tremendous relationship between the idea of christ and the idea of truth for example and well he's literally the embodiment of it of the truth he says in john 14 six the bible verse i am the way the truth and the light so the truth isn't a philosophy or doctrine nearly as much as it is the person of jesus and and to swing back to the revaki stuff so the the truth that is jesus and again in the in that buddhism video peter or revaki says you know i don't like you know truth is very propositional it's very tied to propositional but built within christianity is this idea that well the truth is a person of the truth as a person well what does that mean well that expands from just propositional into the rest of the four p's participatory procedural perspectival i got them all four just at once there but that's but that's in a sense what christianity does by you know jesus is the truth it's a mode of being yes and i believe that i think that's true and and i do think there is something i don't think that redemption occurs and this is the case in psychotherapy as well and it's perhaps where the psychotherapeutic and the christian religious endeavor dovetail i don't think in psychotherapy there is any redemption without the truth psychotherapy is a search for the truth in the past yes a search for the truth in the present and a search for the truth in the future and it is what sets people free even though it's tremendously difficult and there is a place where those conceptual worlds touch right there so yes sir and that's pretty much the end of the video but you know that was most of the video that we played again i'll put the link below in the notes um you know that that was really was a tremendous conversation happened a little over a year ago or a little less than a year ago and it was beginning of april because i was in australia when when i heard that jordan peterson is at liberty university i said what it's that's just crazy and then the thing happens and then they have this conversation whoo well get back to the rest of the video okay jordan peterson and david nasser they're talking about transformations and peterson is very interested in transformations and the source of transformations and they're talking about alcohol and they're talking about religious conversions can elicit a sufficient transformation to break the addiction from alcohol and to afford this for vacay's got me talking his language is anagagay afford this this opening up of one's life to afford new opportunities and peterson talks about his discipline of telling the truth is tough in the short run but in but opens up new possibilities and opportunities in the future and talked a lot in the in my commentary on that about the agent arena relationship christianity has agency in both the individual the the individual agent being you and the arena and we talked about identity being sort of halfway in between remember we conceptualize their agency up instinctively now charles daler talks about in secularity we have the buffered self and this this buffered self in some ways disrupts the interchange between that because part of the dogma about secularity is that the agent cannot have any until i'll use that word ontological cannot have ontological agency it can only have perhaps psychological perhaps some perspectival agency but that eight and in fact the agency is still built into the language and in many ways i see that as the that as really the the line of demarcation between many of the people that we're talking to and again you can you can see this you can see this in jonathan peugeot and john verveckis conversation about you know we're we're looking up and we're seeing agency and can we see agency all the way up can we see all the all the way up but peugeot makes the point in there that we see agency up and we have agency down and you know my point was that it's all of that functioning is is functioning as if the universe is an agent it's functioning jordan peterson language functioning as if god is real okay and and i think that's that's the only way we do it and and i think part of the reason is that because story being our second nature story being sort of a machine cold code with which we use to our our hardware drivers the the piece of software with its we use to connect with the hardware and make sense of this of this world that is far beyond our capacity to to manage it i i think that's why agency that arenas have agency and why religious language continues to be used and i don't think is going away anywhere else what happens in secularity is we believe that the self is buffered that that that jesus can't come into our hearts well what is coming into our hearts and that's the question because can we actually lose that conceptualization can we actually lose that figure of language i'm very doubtful we can secularity resist this you know for many good reasons in order to try to improve the signal to noise ratio is it cloudy outside because i'm feeling blue or am i feeling blue because it's cloudy we do a lot of bs-ing ourselves with elements like this the woman controlling the american space program space force from the gas meter at the living stones church highly skeptical that that is in fact what's going on but but this is part of the reason why in western society when we sort of switch the eye patch over to the scientific image well that sort of helps us manage some things but pay attention that that's a flipping of an eye patch and that's a move that we make that we actually can't live within all right so what's going on with rat and link what's going on with these guys a lot all right um they've undergone a number of transformations and again these transformations as jordan peterson mentioned because this whole world is is so far beyond us um we undergo these transformations and these two being having some talent being on a track of entertainment having some people on much bigger frames pulling them out there kept changing their arena and as their arena keeps changing that agent isn't going to just be able to stay the same so a lot of the pain that you hear in terms of their deconstruction and their transformation and the relational pain you know both of them talked about the the trauma that these journeys have had on their wives and on their children and again the evaluative is this a good thing or a bad thing let's hold off on this stuff because as i mentioned before again now the problem with splitting up my videos is i don't remember exactly when and where i mentioned it if i imagine that let's say adding adderall to me would be a transformation that would help my life i'd get more work done i'd be able to focus better so on and so forth maybe today maybe tomorrow you know i talked about my relationship with caffeine well you know so when i was driving home from my little getaway with my wife and i've got better eyes than she does and when it gets to kind of dusk she you know that that's usually when i'll drive but that's the same time i'm getting a little sleepy so then i drink a coke and well now i'm i've had some more caffeine now is that going to set back getting off the caffeine getting off the caffeine stuff you know is adderall a good thing for me well depends on the time frame doesn't it and so i know a lot of christians are going to be jumping up and down yelling about these guys but you got to give people time and if there's one thing i've learned in ministry it's that take the time that the lord gives you okay and and and be quick to listen and slow to speak and because the judgments that i have right now these snap judgments might not be the same judgment i have later wisdom all right so ret notes um ret notes at the end of link's story that commenters will respond to their stories based on their own world roots that's exactly right um their stories have been part of our arena and so the agent arena thing is going to continue christians a conversionist religion is highly attuned to the impact of influencers and so oh they're impacting the arena and and one of the things that both came through quite clearly in links spiritual deconstruction was that ret had a big part to play and and link mentioned that a lot of times when he's having these conversations with ret he's not telling his wife the role that ret's playing in the conversation because he doesn't want his wife to be upset with ret and at least one person has messaged me and basically blames ret for links spiritual deconstruction in fact ret talks about that in his conversation when link tells his story so we do influence each other where are we all are each other's part of of the arenas but even telling the stories in these ways exposes their christian motivation there was a there was once a member of my church who would send me nasty emails and now there's another person out there i'll just tell the original story but if you're listening to the story and you think it's you it probably isn't because the individual i'm talking about i really can't imagine is listening to any of my youtube videos but this person would send me emails after a sunday and say you are using me as an illustration and i know you're doing it and you have to stop and don't write back now as a preacher part of you hears this and says wow i'm speaking to the heart i wasn't thinking this individual as an illustration i i don't i don't generally sit i don't preach sermons to one individual within the congregation i think that's a little bit unfair but the end of every email was don't write me back and in a sense you know when they're curtailing the kinds of stories they want to get back from twitter okay but the evangelist within us these guys are trying to share their stories of anagog verveky stop colonizing my head of the of the expanding i need a i need it see i need a different word from the one verveky was using because i don't think anagog is going to communicate that well i'm a preacher not a cognitive scientist okay and i my my language has to be fairly vernacular these two have experienced the expansion of their worlds and they see this as a good thing and they want to share this with others and at this point they they quite likely represent as is often the truth they're coming out of a religious tyranny and they're coming out into this bright light of day and and they've got new tools and new experiences and they want to share this they're just trying to share a good thing as in the words of the movie the color purple so they're acting in some ways as evangelists and so christians right quite rightly begin to get a little salty in the new sense of the word where they say and they get upset and they get reactive and this stuff is going to play out i can't stop it they can't stop it just going to play out just because it plays out doesn't mean you need to necessarily jump on one side or the other side's emotional train you can transcend it a little bit maybe take a look and that's the point of this video take a look at transformations because these things happen all the time and not just along religious lines and not just along substance abuse lines in fact all of those lines are categories themselves that are pretty blurry themselves someone might come home and say i'm not a yankee fan anymore i'm a red sox fan there might in some in some households that might be serious business someone comes home and says i've quit my job i want to be a musician i don't want to be an engineer anymore yeah some wives are going to listen to that and say or some husbands are going to say hey what do you mean i gotta go out and get a job i like being house husband there's a lot it's a big world out there with a lot of people so transformations happen all over the place and they're not always welcome especially by the people that you're close to another show that my wife and i were watching let down on netflix an australian show quite funny um there was a there was a woman who was a lesbian and she had had a child and with the sperm donated by a co-worker but for her she was of indian descent and her indian family number one didn't agree with her decision to be a musician wanted her to be a doctor number two didn't agree with her identity as a lesbian remember identity is always between the agency and the arena and number three um she was trying to pass off the sperm donor as her husband and have him show up in videos and he's of the point he said hey look i'm sick of i'm sick of playing this role lying to your family you have to tell the family the truth and these transformations are all over the place but the lines that we see delivered to us by our culture right now are not the only representations or frames through which to see these transportation these these transportations these trans these translations these transformations because as i said before these would be viewed in radically different frames in past centuries with radically different consequences okay and and so even the framing of them is very much now and that shouldn't be forgotten in all of this how can we measure better both testify that their lives are better in their estimation it was a positive transformation they experienced this as again in verveki language anagaga they experienced this as as opening it's the opposite of what happens in an addict where they're losing agency they feel them they themselves have more agency time tells with these things okay i think you if you talk to david nasser david nasser would say the same thing about his christian conversion um better is a function of the manifest image the observing agent is built into so in other words we can't make this evaluation without seeing it from a perspective which is why retz comments about how everybody's going to evaluate this transformation is going to be very germane because everyone will evaluate it through their own filters and basically what i'm trying to do with this video is expand the number of filters that you have through which to evaluate this because there's a lot going on here beyond they were christian and now they're not christian oh this happened because they moved to la yeah that had a part of it oh this happened because they decided to no longer work for campus crusade for christ yeah that had a part of it there's lots of things that had parts of this and and to and to say it was all down to one thing is as they both said it's dismissive it's more complex than any of us can tell just like david nasser's conversion in the other way from islam to christianity is also more complex and david nasser's ability to embrace this whole language and to continue to preach and talk about this language and from all seeming evidence i can't see into the man's heart obviously to do so fully with full conviction and they can't well explain the difference between david nasser and them you can't you don't know enough you don't know enough and and you don't know enough all the way down and so it it is the way it is better worse well you're going to bring your filters to it it's part of the manifest image they have intuitive sense of greater agency in the now and that's sort of where we always have to be evaluating things and peterson touched on that well you pastors better be a little careful yeah as if psychologists don't have filters come on jordan you know that too the arena is part of our continual calibration and evaluation of how am i doing now billy laying down there if i'd wake him i'd say billy how you doing how's this lifestyle ask him the dr phil question how's this lifestyle working for you well he's making the choice to work it now but his you know this reciprocal narrowing has brought him down to a little nub that's under a blanket on the foundation of the lord at i don't know if he's still there it's down easily gets up around noon at about noon and having people walk by and so on and so forth jordan peterson's meaning project is interesting because that little gyroscope so is is is doing drugs at night and sleeping half the day meaningful these two decided that meaning seemed to be following this path out okay it's a conceptualization better worse hey you know what time tells christianity also of course has an imagination that well there's one god there's one judge so finally all of our little permutations we don't really ever know we can't judge ourselves we can't judge each other so built into the christian narrative is a judgment and in that judgment you say okay paul vanderklay how much have you been bs'ing yourself how much have you been diluting yourself when i first started making videos i got a lot of comments about me diluting myself all those people have since wandered off because i make way too many videos to bother keep watching if you're not at least a little bit interested in them but you know i find making these videos meaningful so i keep doing it and and even if i had a smaller fewer people watch the videos or more people watch the videos i keep doing them because i find them meaningful i don't find them terribly expedient this one's long i might have to break it up into a part one and a part two even with the the abridged versions of the video so yeah this one's gonna be a mess anyway time the untreated schizophrenic today says i don't need the drug there's a there's a schizophrenic friend of mine who is right now in a care facility in stockton because he's been he's in his late 60s now and he's been a schizophrenic all his life and he walks the streets of sacramento and i often watch him one of the particular streets that he loves to walk down doesn't have a sidewalk and there's no lights on it and sometimes i'll be coming back from a restaurant or a movie theater and i'll see him walking on the street so someone's gonna get he's gonna get hit well he got hit and um so they took him to the hospital and then they took him to a rehab facility but they're not giving him any schizophrenic drugs he doesn't like what being in them look at the story of son of sam son of sam none untreated schizophrenic kills those people gets sent to prison the state puts him on those drugs and now suddenly sees the world differently and i often think with many of these individuals i usually am pretty patient with people am i too patient time is a tricky thing time is a very tricky thing if my friend now in his late 60s because he became unmanageable for a nursing home and they started giving him i don't even know if this is legal in california california in the 70s and 80s they reshaped the law so that you're free to be crazy if in fact for some reason he would go to prison and they'd put him on schizometic schizophrenic meds and they worked well if they did for him would he say you all weren't very loving to me letting me be crazy keeping not not forcing drugs on me so see in our culture right now sort of like michelle williams we imagine well it's the expression of my will really are you that sure that that little self that's doing that choosing that you feel really knows what's best for you this is a really tricky thing because again one of the things i learned from my father being a pastor a long time if you're pastor long enough if you're pastor long enough you watch people in their stories and they're very complicated and you learn not to judge too quickly because you don't know so gandalf says to says to frodo in the minds of moria i wish bilbo had killed i wish bilbo had killed golem gandalf reminds him even the wise cannot see all ends you don't know well again now as a christian well there's a the arena is an agent and and the agent does know and the agent is is the god and the judge and all of those things and that functions then in your identity and in this aspirational self and on and on and on that we just talked about human beings have a very difficult time managing time and perspective we look up through a telescope and oh there's a star oh there's a nebula well those processes move very slowly and our lives are very short and we make our decisions just in the moment often sometimes we make good ones sometimes we make bad ones regularly again um well i you know again another homeless friend of mine he and i talk for hours i really need to drink less i really need to get into see a shrink i really need to get on drug i get on the the right drugs they don't fix it but they help or you know day in and day out he's bipolar someday he'll be up some days he'll be down on and on and on looks at this guy says oh billy's depressed you know no kidding he's depressed and these are the drugs he's doing okay thanks for letting me know how do you know i have the same drug dealer okay you know everybody talks human beings are very difficult managing time and perspective and time slips by and as we're aging and decaying we've got a limited clock and that heightens the story this is why we use stories this is why we navigate with stories this is why we understand each other through stories this is why we storify up and we storify in and we storify out we can't help it we have to do it it's the only way we really are able to manage time because stories excuse me stories manage time the arena is a story too religions are long communal attempts to manage the agent arena relationship in a systemic and organized way it's a way to gain perspective and deploy it in a viral scalable way for the improvement of the individual community in the world that's what religions do their human authoring programs both individually and communally and there's written text of them so we can track them and work them through if you ask gret and link do you have regrets about how you grew up they'll probably say no it was a great growing up but they're managing in story religions are ways of managing this across our lifetimes because the the deconstructions of rat and link they're happening in you know 2013 to 2020 but that has everything to do with the decades they're living in the centuries they're living in and in fact the millennia they're living in because all of those stories are nested in together and all of those factors we're not anywhere near as buffered as we'd like to imagine if there's a way of bs-ing ourselves by imagining we're not buffered by the arenas that we're inhabiting well anybody who watches their story and wants to dismiss it will will blame the arena and they'll be upset with them for spoiling the arena but all of these things are working up and down back and forth they're far bigger than we are but of course a preacher will say well yeah that's bigger than you but god is bigger than that well what is god well god is the totality of everything look at my conversation again with brett sokol now i'll probably make some more videos about this there's patterns going on and again watch the aaron rogers religion there's just a little take of it on youtube but the the audio version is on danica patrick's thing and if you listen to that you listen to bratt and rat and you just listen to a whole bunch of them patterns all the same all the usual suspects come up cosmological dissonance i talked about with this with brett sokol suckled i'm still not sure i'm saying the same right moral communal dissonance family identity and continuity individual identity and continuity that's a really big deal you undergo a lot of different transformations you know i come home one day and say honey i'm going to be a woman it's a major issues in the marriage after something like that we're all connected with each other and you don't just transition without having someone else transition let's say you're married and you're married to an alcoholic and you wish that they would stop being an alcoholic and maybe in fact they get sober you might not like the sober self that happens all the time so so there's all these individual continuities story continuities and communal continuities in terms of the relationships that were built in there's pluralism having to deal with pluralism there's personal injury or trauma that's not a big part of rat and link story they both had terrific experiences with that but but for others they felt oppressed non-dogmatic binary aaron rogers talks about that quite a bit hell comes up again and again and again but the telling is also in an arena so you present and posture in hope of and hope and anticipation of acceptance and approval i mean they got to the point where this is no this is said enough in them that they can dare to tell their story and they're hoping for affirmation the person who comes out as gay hopes for affirmation again remember identity is somewhere between the the agent and the arena it's a it's a negotiated thing that's part of the reason peterson was talking about pronouns because our language of each other and our identity with which each other it's all negotiated it's not just inside it's not just outside it's within the agent arena that a region that arena is biological that arena is relational that arena is historical that's all that's why all this stuff is really complex and really important so you present and posture in hope and anticipation of acceptance and approval while still presenting some dissonance authenticity and independence that's why if you say ah it's because you moved to la that's dismissive i don't want to hear that well certainly that's part of it it's in in fact you say it's part of it in your story is it the whole thing no by no means it's the whole thing no human human beings are way too complex to boil them down into one tiny little dimension okay way too complex human relationships it's conceptual principalities that are at work in their story whether or not they recognize them as such oh i've been at this a while i don't know how long this video i usually try to keep a cap at two hours so even the i might chop this into four versions you'll see on monday when i put this out i gotta have to render it first and then we'll see what it is but anyway thanks for watching notes for the things that i've talked about should be in the notes below and if there's links that i failed to put in the notes below ask for it in the comment section and either me or somebody else who's paying attention will probably throw it to you so thanks for why
