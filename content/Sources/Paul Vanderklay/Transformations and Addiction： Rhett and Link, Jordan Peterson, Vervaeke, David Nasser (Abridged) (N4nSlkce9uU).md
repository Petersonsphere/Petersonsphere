 Hi, this is Paul. Those of you watching my channel's channel for a while know I've been I'm always playing with new stuff. So one of the things I've been playing with is abridged and I'm playing with the camera right now. Playing with abridged and extended versions of my videos because my videos tend to be very long and I know a bunch of you really like that. A number of you have also said your videos are very long and I'd like to share them but who on earth is gonna sit through a two hour long video from someone they don't even know is you know then I could add other I could project others of my insecurities out onto that comment. So I've been playing around with abridged and unabridged videos and I'm gonna try something with this when I post this probably next Monday you'll know whether or not it succeeds because I don't know yet either but I'm going to have a version of this video that includes the extended commentary on some video clips and some that don't. In the clip that I released yesterday it was just one segment of my conversation with Dr. Brett Sockhold. I of course am this is one single brain here one consciousness Congress that is working through my rough draft for Sunday which I will record later today my Sunday school lessons my family life my church life and it all flows through the same thing and a couple of days ago someone started in fact a number of people started pointing me to the Rhett and Link Good Mythical Morning I mean these guys have been around since sort of the beginning of YouTube I'd never heard of them at all their comedic pair very much grew up within conservative Christianity in the Bible Belt we're doing evangelical comedy for Campus Crusade for Christ and then transitioned to full-time YouTube-ery and then just recently came out as it were in their lack of Christian faith their transformation now that's the word I'm gonna use for this video and the reason I'm using this word for this video is partly the American habit of feeling safer with abstractions so you have the good place in the bad place you don't have heaven and hell so we'll just we'll just use that because transformations tends to be more of the clinical psychological term for the kinds of transformation or transition or deconstruction or Christians might say deconversion that Rhett and Link have been going through now I want before I speak much about them directly and I've got a bunch of video ideas to treat some of the common elements of their story and these are these are elements that are common not only to each other's stories but to I was listening to Aaron Rogers story last night I hear these stories a lot I'm in very close relationship with people who are in the midst of these stories or have made these stories I pastor a church where people's parents and grandparents go to church but their sons and their grandchildren's and their great-grandchildren don't even though they live in the very same town many of them don't go to any church at all so this this this rise of the nuns and ONES is something that's I'm very familiar with and after you hear enough of these stories patterns begin to develop but before I go into the patterns I want to talk about the dynamic itself because I think part of what interests people in this is in fact the dynamic itself if you listen to the Aaron Rodgers interview that he does with his girlfriend Danica Patrick at the beginning of her podcast she opens up basically with you know her little intro to the to the podcast is all about transformation transformation is what everybody wants to enjoy what everybody wants to possess what everyone wants to achieve but but in a good way good transformations because we know that there are bad transformations someone who is not unfamiliar to this channel is Job and I've got his picture down in the corner here Job underwent a transformation after listening to Jordan Peterson talking to me but that was just part of a much longer and once you get to know Job you begin to realize it's part of a much longer journey and so part of the reason many people on this channel have been fascinated with Job is number one if they went to the discord server the link to that is at the show notes they've gotten to know Job Job has has had conversations with many other people interviewing people and so Job has sort of become the pastor of the discord and Job has joined his church in the Netherlands and Job will be going on tour with me and John Van Donk in March and there'll be other video there's some video announcements about that in this in the channel and there'll be some more as the as the venues and times get solidified the dates are pretty much solidified in terms of the cities that we're going to I'm gonna play some lengthy I'm gonna play most of the conversation that Jordan Peterson did with David Nassar because I thought that was that was a really terrific example of Peterson himself and his Petersonian way navigating the question of transformations because if you understand the work of Jordan Peterson and what he done through a lot of his work he was all about individual transformation helping people make their life better that was his goal that was his goal as a clinical psychologist that was very much his goal in terms of the Jordan Peterson phenomenon chapter that was October 2016 to June 2019 those are really the dates from his rise because of Canadian Bill C-16 up until his illness his attempt to withdraw from medication that he had been taking under prescription tried to get off it and you can look at Michaela Peterson's video about that I'm also going to bring in John Verbecky on this one too a video of his from awakening from the meeting crisis that entire series is about transformation John's religion that is not a religion is about transformation and so when we listen to Rhett and Link talk about their deconstruction we're really talking about transformations and I want to make a number of points about transformations before we begin talking about their particular instances now someone had commented to me Tim from who comes to the meetup sometime because again I had yesterday I'd posted a video just a clip from my my conversation with Brett Dr. Brett Sokold he said well probably a lot of people listening to them aren't going to understand everything that you're doing yeah that's probably true and so this video will probably help them orient better to what those of you have been following my channel for a long time are much more aware of the characters on my channel the topics on my channel the kinds of things my channel is in many ways a reflection of myself the things that interest me this is my personal channel this is not necessarily my church work nobody looks over my shoulder and says you should and shouldn't put things on this channel part of the reason I like doing this as a personal channel is because someone could say well you shouldn't do this because of such-and-such well I'm doing the channel they're not that's why I keep my church I have there's a church channel that has my Sunday school lessons and my sermons on one channel but this is on another channel I can be a little bit freer Freddie and Paul shows on this channel that was that started before my whole Jordan Peterson thing and if you go before my Jordan Peterson videos you can find the Freddie and Paul show that's that's something that Freddie wanted to do Freddie's a friend of mine and I've just he and I have been doing this and his mom comes on and other characters come on so so on and so forth but transformations is a big deal and it's a big deal far beyond the Christian Church and ideas of conversion almost every major world religion again a definition of religion that I postulated a few videos ago religions are human authoring programs and so we're all very interested in transformations what does that involve what are they how do we know if they're good or bad that's what this video is going to be about now transformations take place with respect to time and that's important and again if you look at my conversation with Brett Sokol the distinction between natural and human is a complex one I want to not lean too heavily on it but yet not ignore it and so we see transformations in the life cycle of a star there's first a stellar nebula then perhaps it's an average star like the Sun that we enjoy at some point it will become a red giant which we imagine well that would then swallow up and destroy all life on the planet planet earth and then a planetary nebula and then a white dwarf why do we why do we know this well in a sense because of light and how light travels and astronomy we can look up in the heavens and we can in a sense see the various stages of this process because the light that we finally see for eight distances in space is older star nebula is some stars are massive stars and then they become a red giant and then they supernova and they can become a neutrino star black hole this is the current physics says astrophysics says this these are the life cycles of a star all of those things are transformations we're more familiar with transformations of let's say a butterfly begins as an egg and then becomes a caterpillar then a chrysalis then an adult emerges then an adult and this little schema avoids further transformations which is aging death and decay and cue the Lion King the circle of life well there we have there we have all of these transformations these transformations are involuntary the egg doesn't somehow decide consciously in the way that we understand conscious decision-making to become a caterpillar a chrysalis an adult same thing happens to us we are born we don't choose the parents that we're born to in the way that we choose whether we're going to have a Big Mac or a quarter pounder with cheese we we're born we have DNA we're raised we're subject to all sorts of influences but you know at some there's there are clocks going on in our body and and we if the if what we see as the normal process continues we will continue to grow to develop mature there's puberty there's adulthood there's aging and then there's death and then the body breaks down and is consumed by the bacteria worms whatever's eating us so transformations involuntary transformations happen all over the place now involuntary again in terms of human volition and and anything that we currently understand in ourselves as conscious choice and we see it all around the world we see it in the animal kingdom we see it over time now before I get too deep into this I again want to point to Daniel Bonavac's excellent video looking at the philosophical work of Wilfred Sellers who differentiates between the manifest image and the scientific image I'm not going to play that video today I've played it in a number of videos the link will be in the notes below if you're curious at seeing it he notes that there are these two images that we constantly work with the scientific image which is about science and the manifest image which is sort of life the way we live it one of the things that you'll know in Rhett's deconstruction story is the questions about the Bible and science loomed very large in his deconstruction story and that is by no means uncommon recognizing these two different visions I think is fundamental and as Wilfred Sellers noted as Daniel Bonavac articulates in this little video the difference between them is the normative and if we go back and we look and we say well is a stellar nebula good and a white dwarf bad well those categories don't really fit is a stellar nebula nebula better is an average star better is a massive star better well better for what immediately immediately comes to mind is the egg better than the adult monarch butterfly well better for what better to eat better I mean those categories really don't fit the scientific image but we can't live without them in the manifest image so is a butterfly better than an egg science can't tell you that is a black hole better than a stable mature star like the Sun science can't tell you that it can tell you a lot of things that are different about a black hole and the thing that we call the Sun in our cosmology but science can't science can't tell you that now normativity and cap you and what normativity does is is it encapsulates the personal observer which again is a very big issue in in philosophy right now and in science normativity is part of the manifest image and the manifest image has within it the observer okay science is attempts to be of you from nowhere attempts to be objective like this is always true or true in a moment which is a timeless moment and again in my past videos I've talked about all these kinds of things so let's keep this distinction in mind because it actually functions pretty powerfully in this whole question of transformations transformations whereas we can look at them in a sense scientifically and we can observe a variety of things about it science can't tell us well how should I feel about an average star versus a massive star how should I feel about the transformations that go on within me all of those involve the observer and the the personal observer all right now in the animal kingdom we see transformations all the time so I didn't have my dog when he was a puppy my dog is a rescue dog so got him as a very problematic adult and but I love my dog even though my dog bites lots of people fortunately the dog isn't a very big dog and people seem to forgive him when he bites people unlike my Rottweilers that never bit a soul but everybody was afraid of them so my little dog has skin problems my dog has skin problems all the time and for the first oh gosh six years that we've lived that we lived with the dog back and forth to the vet this med that that medication and just all kinds of issues trying to get the dog's skin clear we get the dog skin cleared up and we have them on all these medications and then you know take them off the medications and back the skin would come high-priced hypogenic dog flu blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah finally my wife then just a fit of frustration went to the internet we put him on the Jordan Peterson diet that dog eats hamburger that's what he eats and well he's not strictly on the Jordan Peterson diet he also eats an egg a little while ago we tried out a little bit more rice to the diet for some certain reasons that I won't go into and sure enough he starts smelling yeasty all over again and okay back to the hamburger and since the dogs been on hamburger the dogs really the dogs really done done very very well I have to put my watch on do not disturb for a couple hours because otherwise I get disturbed so he lost weight his skin problems cleared up he had better energy everything he's like a new dog we say now this is a transformation I brought to my dog my dog eats whatever he wants to eat whether it's good for him or not and then once that yeast infection gets going he scratches and scratches and he he will literally scratch all of his fur off and he'll just have swaths of himself that are raw and bleeding and it's a mess I bring the transformation to my dog now I don't cause the transformation the diet is clearly involved in the transformation but it's only the will of myself and my wife were imposing this on the dog now he's very happy to eat hamburger and you know being the cheap Dutchman that I am it pains me when I have to buy hamburger for this animal as opposed to the cheapo dog food that we began with but you know it's actually it's cheaper to feed him hamburger than to pay the vet and pay for the medicine and everything's better so hey but the point here is that I bring this transformation to my dog my dog does not manage this transformation to the best of our knowledge dogs don't understand and have any kind of self-transcendence from the transformation like we have we have all kinds of self-transcendence we watch ourselves in our transformations my dog doesn't watch himself in the transformation we transform him in fact if you look at that little dog people who do genetics say dogs were you know domesticated from wolves and if you look at my tiny little dog you'd say where on earth is the wolf in that dog now maybe in his bite but the dog looks nothing like a wolf in fact the dog is a victim of human transformations in terms of old-style genetic engineering and breeding so that he's tiny and cute and fluffy and has a flat face and on and on and on but as a terrible personality that's my dog so he's been the product of lots of transformations from wolf down to a dog he's a product of our own transformation experimentation in terms of his diet and I think for the most part we want good things for my dog and and he's done he's done fairly well so humans have a level of agency far beyond what we see in other creatures that we know we have a myriad of complex hierarchies as human beings and capacity to change our environment our level of social complexity all of that not only do we have the capacity to colonize or enact transformations involuntarily from the position of the dog upon dogs and upon just about everything else in the world we do it upon ourselves and we do it upon ourselves all the time and we desire to do it upon ourselves in fact we we desire to change ourselves for the better and that entire process again we're calling transformation and it takes many forms and many shapes now there's an excellent video out there by Will Schroeder called every story is the same and again I'll put the I'll put the link down in the in the show notes below and it talks about Joseph Campbell and the hero's journey in the monomyth and of course anybody familiar with Jordan Peterson knows that Peterson in many ways now Peterson has some real differences from Joseph Campbell which he which if you back him into a corner he'll forced to mention but you know Jung is behind this and so very much similar thing from the work that Joseph Campbell did a number of years ago now here's the thing about transformation we represent them we manage them we interact with them we codify them we communicate them we they're all framed by story and again if you look at Jonathan John Verveckis John Verveckis conversation with Benjamin Boyce which I've played in the past John Vervecki talks about the fact that story is a psychotechnology that we possess and again this is something that I thought of long before I started doing the Jordan Peterson stuff I was thinking about maybe a book that I wanted to write because I was thinking about the fact that we are stories and in fact this is something that that Brett Sockel mentioned yesterday said you know that that I began as a seed from my father and the egg of my mother those two elements as such are gone and then they unite and they multiply that initial cell is gone and you know there are all these ideas about every seven years all the cells of my body change and I'm not a biologist I don't know how to evaluate that or or to qualify that or to nuance that but generally speaking I'm a very different creature than the fertilized egg that was in my mother's womb I'm a very different creature than the the the baby that my mother birthed and brought into the world I'm a very different creature than a third grader a fifth grader I'm now in my mid-50s and I'm a very different creature in some ways than I am in my 30s but more alike of what I was in my 30s I've undergone a number of transformations since my 30s I have lost much of my hair my hair has turned gray my teeth continue to get older physiologically I'm aging I'm not as strong as I was I'm just in and strong strong in the in the broader sense I'd probably be more susceptible to virus but but you know I can undergo transformations in terms of diet and exercise medical science all of those things that even within my adult lifespan things will go up and down there have been tremendous transformations in me and in fact one of the common questions I get from people who watch my videos is what are the transformations that Jordan Peterson has brought in you or what are the transformations that making videos have brought in you and what are the transformations of on and on and on and on now I think part of the benefit of doing something like this in my 50s is that in some ways the cake is baked and my the speed of transformation is is no longer what it was when I was conceived when I was an infant when I was a toddler when I was a preschooler even when I was a teenager and even in my early 20s brain pests you know plasticity you know the cake is baked so that I'm going to see lower levels of transformation but but the only way we can sort of track these things or can kind of or can communicate these things are by story and this is part of the reason stories fascinate us because stories are all about transformations and he write in his first book and his magnum opus about basically Christianity in the world he spends a great deal of time in that first book in proland talking about what a story is little red riding hood is not a story I mean just that little red riding hood little red riding hood went to her grandmother's well now we're getting somewhere but it's not a terrible terribly interesting story little red riding hood was going to grandmother's and she had a basket of goodies for her grandmother and wolf met her along the trail and the wolf speaks and and now we have a story now we have something interesting now we have something engages that engages us I would I would say that what is built into us in terms of our desire for meaning is a desire for transformation that is something deep within us but again this this is this is carried by us understood by us seen by us in story I told you the story of my dog and his transformation via his diet but my dog has no such story my dog is is like my dog has very limited amount of self-transcendence in terms of he can't stand back from himself and say oh you know when he was feeding us when they were feeding me first that cheap dog food then that very expensive dog food and now the hamburger I my body was in different ways that my dog doesn't look in the mirror and ponder his existence to the best of our knowledge my dog simply is people often say well live in the moment and I always think like my dog my dog lives in the moment I don't care to live in the moment I care to live in a story a story that I can a story that I can manipulate that I can set myself back from a story that allows me to look at myself in a different way stories that allow me to see other people allow me to sort of conceptualize other people and all of story is very very important in terms of how this all works we use story to frame and track transformations a human story is a story in a way that a dog doesn't have we are a story in a way that we're not a body but we're an embodied story and we keep making new stories and again if you haven't watched my conversation with dr. Brett so cold that was boy that was a highlight of my channel that conversation you have conversations sometimes and they just go so well and you just want to get up and dance it well that's what's actually what I do in my office I get up and I dance a little dance after I have a conversation like that because it was just so good and we it just get meshed into a whole bunch of the things that I've been working on in my in my YouTube and all of that now we are nested stories because not only do we conceptualize ourselves and represent ourselves as a story we represent the world in story form and again in fact we can go all the way back I represent my dog in story form and and in many ways the life cycle of a star is a storified representation of a star and if you just look in a telescope you won't see the story what you do is you see the different elements and you create a story out of it and it's that story that you tell to other people and it's story nested within stories nested within with nested within stories now these conceptualizations are storified okay and I've I often in my videos if you go in the past them I'll ask is is uncle Sam real I'll say well what do you mean by real and again my conversation with Brett so cold made the point that for us there are realities which are greater now we're introducing hierarchy and I would see there are hot there are realities which are not material we might call them inter relational we might call them informational but they are not material and they colonize materiality so I might say well is uncle Sam real and you might say no I can't uncle Sam does not have an address I can't go to a place and lay hands on uncle Sam Jonathan Pajot talks about Santa Claus is Santa Claus real ask a kid yeah I just saw him at the mall well is that Santa Claus well yes is that the real Santa Claus what do you mean is that actually the instantiation of Santa Claus and I would say is uncle Sam real he's real enough for you to pay your taxes he's that real and in fact he's real enough to to motivate young men during the first and second world war to lay down their life for him and so we have these principalities that are conceptualized up and they're also conceptualized as stories and they're also conceptualized as persons and that is instinctive to us all right and and now these stories the mono myth it's really it's really very interesting that the hero's journey the story all of this stuff there are patterns and structures to all of this and and we cannot as human beings without them we have agency within our stories our stories in many ways we we have not we have immaterial agents within our stories every time you hear someone talk about the patriarchy or white supremacy what they're essentially doing is locating agency within a very long story and they're saying that agency is to blame and we have to kill that agency okay that's a conceptualization again nobody like uncle Sam imagines you can go to a particular street address find white supremacy and put white supremacy to death or find the patriarchy and put the patriarchy to death but notice what we're doing with our stories we're lending agency to that story and in fact we're we're we're placing normativity upon that upon that agency and we're we're very easily using this within our story this is how human beings work and in the past this is what happened with religion all right now again if you talk to Sam Harris the issue of agency and free will comes up a lot and so you can watch why Sam Harris and Brett Weinstein keep tripping over free will a video that I did a few weeks ago we feel ourselves to have consequential agency within our stories we bear a degree of responsibility within our stories we can pretty much not conceptualize or work communally or socially or interrelationally without this element of responsibility and personhood and agency human interaction human life as we know it on this world cannot exist without this now Sam Harris tries to flip over to the scientific image and say up via the scientific image we have no agency but then Sam Harris goes on podcast to try and convince us that within the scientific image we have no agency and that's where I talked about Sam Harris is kind of switching the patch over one eye oh now I'm looking at the scientific image oop now I'm looking at the manifest image oop now I'm telling a scientific story oh now I'm telling a manifest image story so back and forth back and forth back and forth and that's what that video was about I played the Daniel Bonavac scientific manifest image story but within the manifest image we cannot conceptualize it as as not being agents and not only just human beings as agents but these other agents within human humanity Uncle Sam white supremacy racism you know all of these things that we basically conceptualize and if you take it for again I'm gonna sound like Jordan Peterson from a psychological perspective God and the gods as agents that that move us Cupid Mars the god of war just this this is what human beings have done all along and we can't help but do it and we will continue to do it because it's the only way we can actually work with each other and manage ourselves because we are all these nested stories now we are blessed or cursed in terms of normativity by the agency of others white supremacy has been a curse to African Americans especially in the Jim Crow South patriarchy has been a curse for women who have been victims of the patriarchy and on and on and on and on let's say communism was a curse for all of the people that were in communism nazism was a curse for the Jewish populations of Eastern Europe on and on and on we go this is these these are the waters that we swim in and and you will find and I've made this point many times that for the most part when people sort of deconstruct their religion they don't really leave religion they just change a lot of the conceptualizations and I see people sort of well maybe they grew up Christian and now then they're an agnostic or an atheist phase but before you know it they start talking to the universe and they say the universe has given me this and the universe has given me that and karma this and karma that again my best example of this is Verizon Lisa you can go back a number of years and look at the LG Lucid Verizon phone commercial where Lisa's walking by and you know she sees a Verizon store with a new smartphone it's not really a smartphone those Lucids weren't I don't even remember if they were androids anyway universe is telling me and so the universe is speaking to her she's having a conversation with the universe this is what we do as human beings we've always done this and we're not going to stop now what's interesting is that we have a bit of self-transcendence with this dynamic about ourselves and this came out recently with Michelle Williams and her speech at the Golden Globes and I'll put the links below in the show notes but what was very interesting about her speech was that she was basically saying my agency over my story is the most important thing in my world and she talked about her abortion and well what is abortion abortion is a degree of colonization with the help of medical professionals because that's that's a critical thing that's seldom looked at your right to an abortion seems to be connected with the demand you can place on a doctor to to perform that procedure on you it's not simply you don't go into a doctor and say oh I have the right to choose remove my hand doctors won't do that I have the right to choose remove my leg doctors won't do that doctors need a reason but in this particular procedure well they offer a reason and so this is what she says about her life I've tried my very best to live a life of my own making and right when I heard that I thought did you choose your genetics did you use that you choose the zip code the parents the school on and on and on and on and on your maybe you chose your hair color but you know there's the vast majority of your life you never chose you are trying as best you can via story to colonize your body and even you know hey lately I've been trying to go on a diet I really haven't hit my eye what I think is my ideal weight so you know on and off I go on my diet I can't even colonize me very well and but I've tried to live my best life my very best life well what is that there's a representation out there again watch towards the end of John Verveckis awakening from the meaning crisis the second self there's a lot of that going on and in the in the talk of the world and and that will be in some of the Jordan Peterson clip that I play with this conversation with David Nasser but you know I've tried I've tried my very best to live a life of my own making and not just a series of events that happened to me what is she saying I've lived my very life in terms of a human authoring program I've lived to try to self author my story I don't just want to be the recipients of a bunch of events that have happened to me well what event caused the pregnancy was that consensual I hope so probably but it wasn't within the timing of the larger story that she had but one that I could stand back and look at and recognize my handwriting all over okay she you have to ask well what is her what is that self what is that person in the middle of this that she's trying to manifest herself in her story and in her life sometimes messy and scrawling sometimes careful and precise she's using a metaphor but again this is this is she's looking for transformations but she herself wants to direct her transformation and have that be a transformation that she sees as better as ideal again this is basic yet it is so steeped in our particular culture and our particular frame of reference it's extremely religious but she if there's no supernatural beings involved people might not say it's religious well it's spiritual okay what do you mean by spiritual what do you mean by that very fudgy word can you please tell me what is spiritual can you explain to me the difference between spiritual here and school spirit if you think about that relationship you might actually have something if you think about well a corpse is a dead person and they when they have you know a living spirit inside of them then they're animated and you can get into much older ideas of spirit so why is spirit and breath if again you go back and you look at the videos that I did about about I almost said I almost said BB Warfield anyway if you go back and look at my other videos you know that but why why do our language why does it why I'm the Owen Barfield why do why do we connect breath and life why do we connect wind and spirit why all these words well she's probably in very spiritual I don't know what she thinks of religion I have no idea really I don't even know what movie she was in I just caught this because obviously because the whole abortion thing this thing got shot up there on Twitter but one that I had carved with my own hand there's another metaphor and I wouldn't have been able to do it without employing a woman's right to choose and her right to demand a doctor to perform a procedure on her I mean that's what we're talking about here but again she's saying agency agency is the goal whatever I am deconstructed or not whatever this this this thing is in me this self this this story writer inside I what what goodness is is a world that is plastic and like putty in my hand to the point that I can mold it and shape it to myself and and that others will collaborate and and be helpful on my path towards my my second self my sacred self my my hidden secret self that needs to be manifest again you start getting into this and you're you're you're all over it religions are all over the place on this your best self my best self now my ideal self I mean this is stuff that we've been talking about for a fairly long time now in the American zeitgeist an individual won't go back to the Declaration of Independence an individual should pursue their dream and their self or their life life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that's essentially what Thomas Jefferson following John Locke was saying and so the role of our society is to afford Michelle Williams the person that she is the agent that she is the self authoring story that she is the ability to write her own story to the degree and in the shape that she wants to see it written now we aspire to achieve all levels of agency but agency is a very funny thing a number of weeks ago a woman was in my church for a couple weeks she'll probably show up again I suspect she lives in a group home somewhere around I don't know her technical diagnosis but having had a lot of experience with a lot of visuals I suspect she's an untreated schizophrenic and she visited the church and we have a lot of schizophrenics that come into the church and said and do their things and my congregation is just pretty accustomed to all of this because again they've been through it for a long time and my congregation has a huge heart and so they often if given opportunity and there have been some really interesting stories in the past where they really helped a number of people live with their schizophrenia she's semi homeless and she had a few things in bags and so I tried to help her out Sunday and then you know she got into the Anglican Church that uses our sanctuary afterwards well that conversation didn't go well but then she came back Monday and the lady runs the child care center here that conversation didn't go well so she calls me and say pastor you gotta do something with this woman so so I came down and you know had more of a chance to talk to her than I had on Sunday because Sunday I'm busy with a lot of different people too so she's from space she got very close relationship with God and she's managing all those things that same self that same pictured used to be a cage that was surrounded an air conditioning units to keep people from stealing it that one day I found another homeless schizophrenic woman sitting in that cage there's a there's basically the the gas meter is right in that cage and of course the child care center was going they were a little disturbed that there's this homeless woman who's sitting there and people are picking up and dropping off their children and so I sat down and talked to her and she explained to me that she was running the American space program right there from the gas meter in the no longer used cage at Living Stones and I was skeptical you know her reality my reality but but she was but many of these people express a great deal of agency now the agency that they expressed to me doesn't usually match the agency I see but you know at some point I'll usually mention to them that I have a degree of agency in terms of my responsibility towards the various organizations that use this building and so I try to modulate that as well as I can I usually try and walk a line but we achieve levels of agency and I think for many of these people that they're from space or that they're managing the American space program from the gas meter at Living Stones Church in Sacramento California and that gives them a degree of meaning they enjoy their agency in fact agency and meaning are deeply tied we we sense meaning when we're when we're exercising our agency okay and again we'll get into John Raviky and Jordan Peterson very shortly actually in this video just this morning when I came to work I actually today I decided not to drive because when I do drive and my cars in the parking lot I get quite a few more visitors at my door because people in the neighborhood you know if they see my car there then they know they stop in and we have a chat or whatever we do but I decided not to drive today so that I could have a little bit more time to make videos and do some office work today and Billy Billy's there Billy has been sleeping by the door Billy I don't know if that's his real name or not people on the street people give you names and there might be names it might be nicknames I don't ask for driver's license I don't ask for ID but let's just call him Billy and Billy you know Billy will be out there sleeping for a little while it becomes irregular and we'll start having conversations that's the way this thing works and then we'll start having conversations and we get him to share share my life but because I know lots of other people on the street and they give me information about Billy ah Billy's sleeping over at your church and because they have the same drug dealer as Billy so I know what kind of drugs he's using and I have a sense of well how dangerous is he and do I have to run him off right now or is this someone who's a little bit more you know some you know and so I'm always managing these kind of things and when you have untreated schizophrenics coming into church you know people with children begin to look around and say is this a safe place sorta I'll I keep an eye on things and that's what I do I keep an eye on things and hopefully bad things don't happen every now and then something bad does happen but that's kind of life so Billy has a drug issue Billy has some issues with his either present or ex-wife Billy has a homeless issue but he's got a lot of issues Billy's depressed so it's a lot of the other homeless people I know come along and they diagnose each other because they're all in and out of mental hospitals all the time and they're all familiar with this language and round and around we go now homelessness is a huge issue in in California right now it's a big topic of conversation and people want to help people feel sympathy for the homeless people are annoyed and disgusted you know just a little bit up there there's a turd sitting in the grass and when I catch Billy awake one of these days and say Billy it can't be leaving turds in the grass you got to clean that stuff up and you know so Billy and I will do a lot of negotiating and we'll do a certain amount of relating and Billy's what I will tolerate certain things around here and I will not tolerate other things around here and there's a lot of difference of opinion in terms of what I should and shouldn't tolerate I engage these negotiations and conversations also with the church leadership in mind and you know we try to walk this line I you know one of the things talk about religion in the Bible you have the story of Lazarus and the rich man don't want to be the rich man stepping over this guy and and I'll Paul Vanderkley you know there's Billy Billy's in the bosom of Abraham and you're in the part of Hades that's getting a little hot and say Lord can you have Billy come down and bring me a water a little bit of water just to cool my tongue these stories roam around in our imagination and they seep into the culture and they seep into the site guys and they seep seep into our moral structures and so another homeless guy used to stay here a lot it often really if there's a psychologist out there tell me what the deal is with homeless people in shoes please so there's a and and mental illness in shoes so this guy you know he never wanted to wear shoes he's while I was walking around barefoot his feet were a mess and people would always stop by and give him shoes and he'd say people always give me shoes I hate shoes and people would give him things you'd always accept it then he'd kind of go through what they give him and he'd keep what he'd wanted throw out the other and all that garbage would stay on my property unless somebody else came along and one man's garbage is another man's treasure and on and on and on and on but addiction almost almost all of these people are struggling with what we would call substance abuse and almost all of these people and again you have conversations drug addicts know their drugs they know their drug dealers and they know the they know the prescribed drugs and the unprescribed drugs and you know I have a lot of conversations with these people about their drugs and you know well how do these people are self-medicating alcohol is a powerful powerful drug it's a very useful drug bipolar's try to level out with alcohol though when they're when they're manic alcohol for some of them slows them down a little bit and and when they're depressed alcohol takes the edge off and you know a friend of mine I mean his greatest heart was to wake up sober you don't want to wake up sober that might mean that he just you know would urinate in his blanket even though he doesn't have another blanket and they know on and on and on and on I've lived in 22 first day I came to work here at this church there was a homeless woman sitting in the parking lot and it's for 22 years I've just had relationships with this population and it's just the way it goes but people in California are frightened and well what can we do about these people let's put them in tiny houses housing first let's wrap around services on and on and on and on and on these programs might help are they gonna solve the problem probably not because human beings are not problems to be solved and we're mysteries to ourselves and this is difficult but addiction is a very big deal and addiction has in many ways taken on a clinical reality and we have we have approached addiction sort of in the way that I approach Mookie and his skin problems and maybe if we can alter the environment we can help with an addiction and there's good reason to believe that now one of my favorite videos in John Verveckis series is episode 13 where he talks about Buddhism parasitic processing and he talks about a friend of his who does a lot of work on addiction and because well addiction is one of the things that one of the ways that alcoholics anonymous tried to encourage people to find help in society for their alcohol problem was to try to reduce the stigma by medicalizing alcoholism and so alcoholism is a disease and then later on when we had more ideas about how the brain works oh there's a genetic predisposition predisposition to alcoholism alcoholism the attempt was to take alcoholism away from the moral valence alcohol is not a moral problem and this is where you get into questions of should you incarcerate drug users or should you put them in treatment programs now is addiction a moral question now if you're the son or child of an alcoholic or the partner of an alcoholic or the neighbor of an alcoholic sort of like I am right now moral notions crop up okay you should not lay turds in the landscaping at Living Stones you should not strewn the bushes with your dirty toilet paper you should not just urinate here so that it smells like a toilet when I have to come into my office you should not you should not you should not these are all moral questions but then we get the question of agency to what degree can he manage himself and these are the kinds of questions that anyone who's dealt with an addict deals with continually where is their agency in the addiction now John Vervecki will talk about this in terms of see I'm thinking about now I'm gonna do the long and the short version of this video John I think the short versions are gonna be plenty long John Vervecki is gonna do the reset he's gonna talk about addiction in terms of agency and reciprocal narrow narrowing and if you listen to the whole video he connects that with Buddhism and I was just re-listening to the whole video on my walk here to church so I don't have my car here so I don't have too many bangs on the door while I'm trying to make a video and reciprocal narrowing that's what addiction is if there's such a thing as reciprocal narrowing is there also reciprocal enlargening or as he'll use the term enlightening now if you listen to Rhett and Link no I haven't forgotten about them if you listen to Rhett and Link you'll notice that as for many people who have undergone a voluntary transformation even sometimes an involuntary transformation they'll say my life is better now better in what way to look at categoricals or universals is very difficult but they could say you know getting sober was hard but it was an improvement and in fact when I was I had one homeless person he sat in that chair right there and he had a can of beer with him and he sat that can of beer on the on my table and he said my life is in that can and this individual he worked he worked as a painter and he would works a painter basically repainting apartments for a guy who had a lot of apartments and just needed repainted after every tenant left so we'd repaint the apartment and he'd get paid under the table and most of the time he would sleep outside because he didn't want to pay rent because rent would take a lot of his income and he would rather devote almost all of his income to alcohol so he said my life is in that can he understood that stood that about himself and many of the homeless addicts that I deal with have had periods of sobriety in their life they've been through 12-step programs multiple times they've been in and out of psychiatric facilities locked and unlocked on and on and on and on and on and they have a degree of self-transcendence about it and they understand the fact that if you're an addict you don't want agency and and so so John in this video is going to talk about agency and now John is a professor at the University of of Toronto if you've been on my channel a while John has been on my channel a number of times we have regular conversations I look forward to sharing a stage with him in in Thunder Bay Ontario when we do this conference with Jonathan Peugeot really looking forward to that conference really looking forward to meeting John and Jonathan in person and spending time with them and having conversations with them all of my conversations with John Vervecki have been just wonderful experiences along with some of John's friends that that I've gotten acquainted with Guy Sengstock and Christopher Mastro Pietro I mean John's got a wonderful community around him and you know some people found John through my channel and some people have found me through John's channel and this little corner of the internet has been a wonderful thing but he's a cognitive he's a he's a cognitive scientist and so he tries to work on all of these things in terms of the big picture and so he makes the point in this video that it's not simply a biochemical relationship you can be addicted to video games drug addiction is if it were merely biochemical it would look very different in people's lives a 12-step program talking you know and community accountability wouldn't be as helpful why does age and and addiction why are they involved a lot of people get sober at a certain age just because because of age you know on and on and on this stuff is different so if you are watching the abridged version you're not going to see the video if you're watching the full version you can see the video so John talks about the agent arena relationship and talks about the fact that what we can understand addiction as a narrowing and then we can understand enlightenment now this word very interestingly is used by Buddhism it's used by the West in terms of the enlightenment and and what was understood by that enlightenment is not a narrowing but an expanding and and and Rhett and Link see the transformation that they have undergone as an expanding and if you listen to both of their stories as they tell their own stories these are the kinds of terms that they use they feel more free they feel less constrained that is how that that is how they are perceiving it now to evaluate it as we're going to get into a little bit later in the video is actually remarkably difficult because I might feel let's say I I decide that I am let's say Adderall let's say I decide well I'm going to start taking Adderall because I've always been ADHD they didn't really have that language when I was in school I wasn't on Ritterland so I'm gonna take Adderall and I start taking Adderall and I can talk about the transformational effects that Adderall have on me and I feel like I can get more work done I feel like I can concentrate better I feel like I can there's a really fun documentary on Netflix about about Adderall and you know things are going really well things are going really great well is that really gonna be just an expanding thing because maybe Adderall works for me in time but later maybe it won't just you know see the problem with doing these abridged and longer versions is I never remember because I just do it all in one sitting I never remember which one I I actually made the comment in but you know I mentioned how want to lose weight want to eat better well sometimes I get in a habit of drinking a soda in the late afternoon I'm not a coffee drinker so I don't take caffeine in the morning and I don't drink alcohol so I don't a lot of people are on that take caffeine in the morning take alcohol at night and so you're using those tools to sort of manage your day you might feel like that is that is enlightening it is expanding your agency it is it is it is making your life a better thing so but sometimes in the afternoon I'll you know I've been working for a while I'm not as sharp as I was in the morning so then I will drink a soda have some caffeine and boom yeah I'm starting to get my work done well maybe with Adderall whoosh now now we're really doing something caffeine is one thing Adderall is another but things that I notice after I once I start getting into this soda habit well a few weeks will go by and I'll notice okay I really shouldn't drink be drinking the soda I've gotten off of diet sodas because I noticed that you know drinking those things some of those sweeteners they're not very good for you so then you know there's a particular Pepsi that has cane sugar you can drink Mexico that you can get at Costco with with cane sugar in instead of the high fructose corn syrup and but then I realized that I'm drinking a soda every day I really shouldn't drink that soda so okay so now I'm gonna get off the soda kick and you know what the next day comes around and three o'clock hits and it's like a little bit of a headache my body is conditioned to having that soda and not only my body I've talked to some people have tried to quit smoking you know smoking in Facebook for a friend of mine they just go together and so when she finally had to quit smoking it was really hard and you know smokers always deal with these kinds of things but and so again if I take Adderall it might feel in the moment like enlightenment like I can get more work done like everything is better like my horizons are opening but over a certain amount of time I might discover that that wasn't really the case or it was temporarily case again these things are very difficult to figure out and we use stories to track them now I'm gonna play quite a bit of the video of Jordan Peterson's conversation with David Nassar now this happened when Jordan Peterson went and visited Convocation at Liberty University and there was an event that happened there those videos have been out for quite a while the talk with David Nassar was really interesting they first begin talking about suicide because the person who rushed the stage because he wanted to meet Jordan Peterson was struggling with suicide but then they eventually got into what I think is the far more interesting part of Jordan Peterson's work which is again is all about transformations but trying to figure out the relationship between internal transformation my agency within and the degree that the arena functions like an agency or the degree to which we conceptualize the re the arena as agency and the way that that actually helps in terms of breaking addiction in terms of an agag a as as verveki would call it in terms of enlightenment in terms of extending my horizons of being a better person and actually most of this conversation is germane to this so again if you're watching the abridged version if you want to see the rest of the version the link to the main videos the original videos are in the show notes the expanded version will be on the same channel I'm releasing them the same day so let's start that video okay Jordan Peterson and David Nassar they're talking about transformations and Peterson is very interested in transformations and the source of transformations and they're talking about alcohol and they're talking about religious conversions can elicit a sufficient transformation to break the addiction from alcohol and to afford this for vacu's got me talking his language is an agag a afford this this opening up of one's life to afford new opportunities and Peterson talks about his discipline of telling the truth is tough in the short run but in but opens up new possibilities and opportunities in the future and talked a lot in the in my commentary on that about the agent arena relationship Christianity has agency in both the individual the the individual agent being you and the arena and we talked about identity being sort of halfway in between remember we conceptualize their agency up instinctively now Charles Taylor talks about in secularity we have the buffered self and this this buffered self in some ways disrupts the interchange between that because part of the dogma about secularity is that the agent cannot have any until I'll use that word ontological cannot have ontological agency it can only have perhaps psychological perhaps some perspectival agency but that eight and in fact the agency is still built into the language and in many ways I see that as the that as really the the line of demarcation between many of the people that we're talking to and again you can you can see this you can see this in Jonathan Peugeot and John Verbeckis conversation about you know we're looking up and we're seeing agency and can we see agency all the way up can we see all the all the way up but Peugeot makes the point in there that we see agency up and we have agency down and you know my point was that it's all of that functioning is is functioning as if the universe is an agent it's functioning Jordan Peterson language functioning as if God is real okay and and I think that's that's the only way we do it and and I think part of the reason is that because story being our second nature story being sort of machine cold code with which we use to our hardware drivers the piece of software with its we use to connect with the hardware and make sense of this of this world that is far beyond our capacity to to manage it I think that's why agency that arenas have agency and why religious language continues to be used and I don't think is going away anywhere else what happens in secularity is we believe that the self is buffered that that that Jesus can't come into our hearts well what is coming into our hearts and that's the question because can we actually lose that conceptualization can we actually lose that figure of language I'm very doubtful we can secularity resist this you know for many good reasons in order to try to improve the signal to noise ratio is it cloudy outside because I'm feeling blue or am I feeling blue because it's cloudy we do a lot of BSing ourselves with elements like this the woman controlling the American space program space force from the gas meter at the Livingstone's church I highly skeptical that that is in fact what's going on but but this is part of the reason why in Western society when we sort of switch the eyepatch over to the scientific image well that sort of helps us manage some things but pay attention that that's a flipping of an eyepatch and that's a move that we make that we actually can't live within all right so what's going on with Rhett and Link what's going on with these guys a lot all right they've undergone a number of transformations and again these transformations as Jordan Peterson mentioned because this whole world is is so far beyond us we undergo these transformations and these two being having some talent being on a track of entertainment having some people on much bigger frames pulling them out there kept changing their arena and as their arena keeps changing that agent isn't going to just be able to stay the same so a lot of the pain that you hear in terms of their deconstruction and their transformation and the relational pain you know both of them talked about the the trauma that these journeys have had on their wives and on their children and again the evaluative was just a good thing or a bad thing let's hold off on this stuff because as I mentioned before again now the problem with splitting up my videos is I don't remember exactly when and where I mentioned it if I imagine that let's say adding adderall to me would be a transformation that would help my life I get more work done I'd be able to focus better so on and so forth maybe today maybe tomorrow you know I talked about my relationship with caffeine well you know so when I was driving home from my little getaway with my wife and I've got better eyes than she does and when it gets to kind of dusk she you know that that's usually when I'll drive but that's the same time I'm getting a little sleepy so then I drink a coke and well now I've had some more caffeine now is that gonna set back getting off the caffeine getting off the caffeine stuff you know is adderall a good thing for me well depends on the time frame doesn't it and so I know a lot of Christians are gonna be jumping up and down yelling about these guys but you got to give people time and if there's one thing I've learned in ministry it's that take the time that the Lord gives you okay and and and be quick to listen and slow to speak and because the judgments that I have right now these snap judgments might not be the same judgment I have later wisdom all right so Rhett notes Rhett notes at the end of links story that commenters will respond to their stories based on their own world roots that's exactly right their stories have been part of our arena and so the agent arena thing is going to continue Christians a conversionist religion is highly attuned to the impact of influencers and so oh they're impacting the arena and and one of the things that both came through quite clearly in links spiritual deconstruction was that Rhett had a big part to play and and link mentioned that a lot of times when he's having these conversations with Rhett he's not telling his wife the role that Rhett's playing in the conversation because he doesn't want his wife to be upset with Rhett and at least one person has messaged me and basically blames Rhett for links spiritual deconstruction in fact Rhett talks about that in his conversation when link tells his story so we do influence each other where are we all are each other's part of of the arenas but even telling the stories in these ways exposes their Christian motivation there was a there was once a member of my church who would send me nasty emails and now there's another person out there I'll just tell the original story but if you're listening to the story and you think it's you it probably isn't because the individual I'm talking about I really can't imagine is listening to any of my YouTube videos but this person would send me emails after a Sunday and say you are using me as an illustration and I know you're doing it and you have to stop and don't write back now as a preacher part of you hears this and says well I'm speaking to the heart I wasn't thinking this individual as an illustration I don't I don't generally sit I don't preach sermons to one individual within the congregation I think that's a little bit unfair but the end of the email was don't write me back and in a sense you know when they're curtailing the kinds of stories they want to get back from Twitter okay but the evangelist within us these guys are trying to share their stories of an agog hunt of verveky stop colonizing my head of the of the expanding I need a I need it see I need a different word from the one verveky was using because I don't think an agog a is gonna communicate that well I'm a preacher not a cognitive scientist okay and I might my language has to be fairly vernacular these two have experienced the expansion of their worlds and they see this as a good thing and they want to share this with others and at this point they they quite likely represent as is often the truth they're coming out of a tear religious tyranny and they're coming out into this bright light of day and and they've got new tools and new experiences and they want to share this they're just trying to share a good thing as in the words of the movie the So they're acting in some ways as evangelists and so Christians right quite rightly begin to get a little salty in the new sense of the word where they say and they get upset they get reactive and this stuff is gonna play out I can't stop it they can't stop it just gonna play out just because it plays out doesn't mean you need to necessarily jump on one side or the other side's emotional train you can transcend it a little bit maybe take a look and that's the point to this video take a look at transformations because these things happen all the time and not just along religious lines and not just along substance abuse lines in fact all of those lines are categories themselves that are pretty blurry themselves someone might come home and say I'm not a Yankee fan anymore I'm a Red Sox fan there might in some in some households that might be serious business someone comes home and says I've quit my job I want to be a musician I don't want to be an engineer anymore yeah some wives are gonna listen to that and say or some husbands are gonna say hey what do you mean I gotta go out and get a job I like being house husband there's a lot it's a big world out there with a lot of people so transformations happen all over the place and they're not always welcome especially by the people that you're close to another show that my wife and I were watching let down on Netflix an Australian show quite funny there was a woman who was a lesbian and she had a child and with the sperm donated by a coworker but for her she was of Indian descent and her Indian family number one didn't agree with her decision to be a musician wanted her to be a doctor number two didn't agree with her identity as a lesbian remember identity is always between the agency and the arena and number three she was trying to pass off the sperm donor as her husband and have him show up in videos and he's a point he said hey look I'm sick of playing this role lying to your family you have to tell the family the truth and these transformations are all over the place but the lines that we see delivered to us by our culture right now are not the only representations or frames through which to see these transportation these these transportation these trans these translations these transformations because as I said before these would be viewed in radically different frames in past centuries with radically different consequences okay and and so even the framing of them is very much now and that shouldn't be forgotten in all of this how can we measure better both testify that their lives are better and their estimation it was a positive transformation they experience this as again in verveki language anagagic they experience this as as opening it's the opposite of what happens in an addict where they're losing agency they feel themselves have more agency time tells with these things okay I think you if you talk to David Nassar David Nassar would say the same thing about his Christian conversion better as a function of the manifest image the observing agent is built into so in other words we can't make this evaluation without seeing it from a perspective which is why Rett's comments about how everybody's going to evaluate this transformation is going to be very germane because everyone will evaluate this transformation. They will evaluate it through their own filters and basically what I'm trying to do with this video is expand the number of filters that you have through which to evaluate this because there's a lot going on here beyond they were Christian and now they're not Christian anymore oh this happened because they moved to LA yeah that had a part of it oh this happened because they decided to no longer work for Campus Crusade for Christ yeah that had a part of it there's lots of things that had parts of this and and to and to say it was all down to one thing is as they both said it's dismissive it's more complex than any of us can tell just like David Nassar's conversion in the other way from Islam to Christianity is also more complex and David Nassar's ability to embrace this whole language and to continue to preach and talk about this language and from all seeming evidence I can't see into the man's heart obviously to do so fully with full conviction and they can't well explain the difference between David Nassar and them you can't you don't know enough you don't know enough and and you don't know enough all the way down and so it is the way it is better worse well you're going to bring your filters to it it's part of the manifest image they've been to it in a sense of greater agency in the now and that's sort of where we always have to be evaluating things and Peterson touched on that well you pastors better be a little careful yeah as if psychologists don't have filters come on Jordan you know that too the arena is part of our continual calibration and evaluation of how am I doing now Billy Lane down there if I'd wake him I'd say Billy how you doing how's this lifestyle to ask him the doctor Phil question how's this lifestyle working for you well he's making the choice to work it now but his you know this reciprocal narrowing has brought him down to a little nub that's under a blanket on the foundation of the Lord at I don't know if he's still there it's down easily gets up around noon at about noon and having people walk by and so on and so forth Jordan Peterson's meaning project is interesting because that little gyroscope so is is is doing drugs at night and sleeping half the day meaningful these two decided that meaning seemed to be following this path out okay it's a conceptualization better worse hey you know what time tells Christianity also of course has imagination that well there's one God there's one judge so finally all of our little permutations we don't really ever know we can't judge ourselves we can't judge each other so built into the Christian narrative is a concept of a judgment and in that judgment you say okay Paul VanderKlay how much have you been BS in yourself how much have you been diluting yourself when I first started making videos I got a lot of comments about me diluting myself all those people since wandered off because I make way too many videos to bother keep watching if you're not at least a little bit interested in them but you know I find making these videos meaningful so I keep doing it and even if I had a smaller fewer people watch the videos or more people watch the videos I keep doing them because I find them meaningful I don't find them terribly expedient this one's long I might have to break it up into a part one and a part two even with the the abridged versions of the video so yeah this one's gonna be a mess anyway time the untreated schizophrenic today says I don't need the drug there's a there's a schizophrenic friend of mine who is right now in a care facility in Stockton because he's been he's in his late 60s now and he's been a schizophrenic all his life and he was walks the streets of Sacramento and I often watch him one of the particular streets that he loves to walk down doesn't have a sidewalk and there's no lights on it and sometimes I'll be coming back from a restaurant or a movie theater and I'll see him walking on the streets someone's gonna get he's gonna get hit well he got hit and so they took him to the hospital and then they took him to a rehab facility but they're not giving him any schizophrenic drugs he's he doesn't like what being in them look at the story of son of Sam son of Sam untreated schizophrenic kills those people get sent to prison the state puts him on those drugs and now suddenly sees the world differently and I often think with many of these individuals I usually am pretty patient with people am I too patient time is a tricky thing time is a very tricky thing if my friend now in his late 60s because he became unmanageable for a nursing home and they started giving him I don't even know if this is legal in California California in the 70s and 80s they reshaped the law so that you're free to be crazy if in fact for some reason he would go to prison and they'd put him on schizophrenic meds and they worked well if they did for him would he say you all weren't very loving to me letting me be in the hospital I'd be crazy keeping not not forcing drugs on me see in our culture right now sorta like Michelle Williams we imagine well it's the expression of my will really are you that sure that that little self that's doing that choosing that you feel really knows what's best for you this is a really tricky thing because again one of the things I learned from my father being a pastor a long time if you're pastor long enough you watch people in their stories and they're very complicated and you learn not to judge too quickly because you don't know so Gandalf says to says to Frodo in the minds of Moria I wish Bilbo had killed I wish Bilbo had killed Gollum Gandalf reminds him even the wise cannot see all ends you don't know well again now as a Christian well there's a the arena is an agent and the agent does know and the agent is is the God and the judge and all of those things and that functions then in your identity and in this aspirational self and on and on and on that we just talked about human beings have a very difficult time managing time and perspective we look up through a telescope and oh there's a star oh there's a nebula well those processes move very slowly and our lives are very short and we make our decisions dress just in the moment often sometimes we make good ones sometimes we make bad ones regularly again well I you know again another homeless friend of mine he and I talk for hours I really need to drink less I really need to get into see a shrink I really need to get on drug I get on the right drugs they don't fix it but they help or you know day in and day out bipolar someday I'll be up some days will be down on and on and on looks at the stars and says oh there's a nebula well those processes move very slowly and our lives are very short and our lives are very short and our lives are very short and our lives are very short and our lives are very short and our lives are very short and our lives are very short and our lives are very short and our lives are very short and our lives are very short and our lives are very short and our lives are very short and our lives are very short and our lives are very short and our lives are very short and our lives are very short and our lives are very short and our lives are very short and this guy says all Billy's depressed you know no kidding he's depressed and these are the drugs he's doing okay thanks for letting me know how do you know I have the same drug dealer okay you know everybody talks human beings are very difficult managing time and perspective and time slips by and as we're aging and decaying we've got a limited clock and that heightens the story this is why we use stories this is why we navigate with stories this is why we understand each other through stories this is why we store if I up and we store if I in and we store if I out we can't help it we have to do it it's the only way we really are able to manage time because stories excuse me stories manage time the arena is a story to religions are long communal attempts to manage the agent arena relationship in a systemic and organized way it's a way to gain perspective and deploy it in a viral scalable way for the improvement of the individual community in the world that's what religion's do their human authoring programs both individually and communally and there's written text of them so we can track them and work them through if you ask Rhett and Link do you have regrets about how you grew up they'll probably say no it was a great growing up but they're managing in story religions are ways of managing this across our lifetimes because the deconstructions of Rhett and Link they're happening in you know 2013 to 2020 but that has everything to do with the decades they're living in the centuries they're living in and in fact the millennia they're living in because all of those stories are nested in together and all of those factors were not anywhere near as buffered as we'd like to imagine if there's a way of BS in ourselves by imagine we're not buffered by the arenas that we're inhabiting well anybody who watches their story and wants to dismiss it will will blame the arena and they'll be upset with them for spoiling the arena but all these things are working up and down back and forth they're far bigger than we are but of course a preacher will say well yeah that's bigger than you but God is bigger than that well what is God well God is the totality of everything look at my conversation again with Brett Sokol now I'll probably make some more videos about this there's patterns going on and again watch the Aaron Rodgers religion there's just a little take of it on YouTube but the audio version is on Danica Patrick's thing and if you listen to that you listen to Rhett and Rhett and you just listen to a whole bunch of them patterns all the same all the usual suspects come up cosmological dissonance I talked about with this with Brett Sokol Sokol and it's still not sure I'm saying the same right moral communal dissonance family identity and continuity individual identity and continuity that's a really big deal you undergo a lot of different transformations you know I come home one day and say honey I'm gonna be a woman it's a major issues in the marriage after something like that we're all connected with each other and you don't just transition without having someone else transition let's say you're married and you're married to an alcoholic and you wish that they would stop being an alcoholic and maybe in fact they get sober you might not like the sober self that happens all the time so there's all these individual continuities story continuities and communal continuities in terms of the relationships that were built in there's pluralism having to deal with pluralism there's personal injury or trauma that's not a big part of Rhett and Link's story they both had terrific experiences with that but for others they felt oppressed non dogmatic binary Aaron Rogers talks about that quite a bit hell comes up again and again and again but the telling is also in an arena so you present and posture in hope of and hope and anticipation of acceptance and approval I mean they got to the point where this is no this is said enough in them that they can dare to tell their story and they're hoping for affirmation the person who comes out as gay hopes for affirmation again remember identity is somewhere between the the agent and the arena it's a it's a negotiated thing that's part of the reason Peterson was talking about pronouns because our language of each other and our identity with which each other it's all negotiated it's not just inside it's not just outside it's within the agent arena that a region that arena is biological that arena is relational that arena is historical that's all that's why all this stuff is really complex and really important so you present and posture and hope and anticipation of acceptance and approval while still presenting some dissonance authenticity and independence that's why if you say it's because you moved to LA that's dismissive I don't want to hear that certainly it's part of it it's in fact you say it's part of it in your story is it the whole thing no by no means it's the whole thing no human human beings are way too complex to boil them down into one tiny little dimension okay way too complex human relationships it's conceptual that are at work in their story whether or not they recognize them as such oh I've been at this a while I don't know how long this video I usually try to keep a cap at two hours so even the I might chop this into four versions you'll see on Monday when I put this out I got to have to render it first and then we'll see what it is but anyway thanks for watching notes for the things that I've talked about should be in the notes below and if there's links that I failed to put in the notes below ask for it in the comment section and either me or somebody else who's paying attention will probably throw it to you so thanks for watching
