 Hi this is Paul and I'm back again with Chris. Chris and I did a video not very long ago where we talked about calculus and God and that was that was the video was very well received and I was I mean just opened up whole new vistas for me with that video so Chris I'm really pleased that you willing to come back on and talk some more about some of this and some other stuff so yeah. Fantastic well Paul it's a pleasure to speak with you again and man I've enjoyed your content so much over the last months now I guess yeah so just an update on the whole calculus thing after they did the video I've been trying to write a blog post to to explain things a little more clearly not done but hopefully within finding time for it's a bit of a challenge okay hopefully within a month or two I'll have that done it's going to be titled standing on the shoulders of acrobats which is a play on Newton standing on the shoulders of giants right but anyway we'll get into that what happened though is out of the video one of my kids sent it to a friend of his that's a prof at U of T and in I think he's in genetics but he sent a link back about this book that has just released by a Cornell prop of mathematics called infinite powers how calculus reveals the secrets of the universe so this is I don't have the author's name in front of it. Steven Straughats something like that so you can find it on Amazon. That's right so since I'm like just an engineer and not a professor of mathematics I thought it was you if you don't mind I'm just gonna read a couple quick paragraphs of the introduction. No go ahead. Almost word-for-word what I was saying. Really? Oh so I was like excited and like oh well maybe I can go back to doing my job. So his introduction is without calculus we wouldn't have cell phones computers or microwave ovens we wouldn't have radio or television or ultrasound for expectant mothers or GPS for lost travelers we wouldn't have split the atom unravel the human genome or put astronauts on the moon we might not even have the Declaration of Independence. It's a curiosity of history that the world was changed forever by an arcane branch of mathematics how could it be that a theory originally about shapes ultimately reshaped civilization and then he goes on he says the essence of the answer lies in the quip that the physicist Richard Feynman made to novelist Herman Wouk and the quip I'm gonna skip ahead the quip is he asked Wouk does he know calculus and I guess it's woke or Wouk I'm not sure how to pronounce the name but anyway and Wouk committed he didn't and Feynman said you had better learn it it's the language God talks. That's just the introduction I've only the books I knew I've only had it a few days I've skimmed through it and it's a really fantastic exposition of what calculus does in our world and what it actually how it came about a little less history than the other book yeah but it's just beautifully well done by someone that absolutely loves the math I mean he's a professor of applied math that for now. Wow. So that excited me yet again. Well I wish I had known this stuff when I was learning calculus in college you know I was just learning calculus because they told me I should guess that's why you learn half the stuff you learn when you're young but fascinating fascinating stuff no and the conversation that we had I just I had never thought about any of that stuff and I'm of course kind of a junkie on new ideas so I get excited easily. So I'll add this I'll add this to yet the the the the enormous pile of books that I intend to read and some of which I've started reading but haven't finished and yep fascinating but absolutely really cool really cool so I don't know how to start talking about the Vivek video the most recent one where he talks about a Goppe yeah and Jesus and what that means except that it I was I was really surprised at how well expressed at least a portion of the gospel was yes yes I thought so I just put a video out this morning and my I didn't comment yet on the latest video that he did but the one before where he had the last 10 12 minutes where he talked about love and the power of love and I thought I decided my video I thought I'm gonna rip a bunch of this stuff off because this is this is really I hadn't heard anybody quite put it the way he did and so I was I was very impressed by you know by how he how he laid it out and so then so then I watched the next video you you sent me a lot of people sent me that video said you have to watch this video you have to comment on this video and when I saw it I thought I do have to comment on this video but there's a whole bunch of say before we get to that video because the the context is fraught and you can you can talk about Buddhism in a way publicly now that no one is threatened by you mean you can you can you can somewhat talk about Islam I mean that's obviously for political reasons a bit fraught but Christianity is so overwhelmingly fraught in our Western post Christendom context so you of course has to give all these disclaimers and then and it's also fraught because you know find two theologians have two perspectives on the same book because all us Christians have been arguing about the nuance and the detail of what he's talking about for what five hundred years now right so so what what struck you about it and and why did it why did it grab your attention the way it did well many things first of all that it was just this straightforward aside from he made some disclaimers okay so one thing that struck me was his tone while he's talking about this seems substantially different than other videos he's done there was at moments there was a fair bit of gravitas in his and maybe I'm reading all that I'll have to go back and watch some other video to be to be certain about that but it certainly seemed that way to me and he I think he mentioned in some of his early stuff that he was brought up Christian yeah yeah I remember that too so there's something there that was a little bit it seemed like it was a little bit personal yeah but aside from that it was having given what you were just saying it was a straightforward non polemical non or you know like non argumentative yeah expression of what his what what part of the tape what part of his take is anyway on agape and the fact that what like God's love first on the scene two thousand years ago and he used the term it was incarnated in Christ and so those things really caught my ear when he made the distinction between what I think he was on to Paul already but maybe not but the distinction between Plato through the Enlightenment Plato that Plato had done it in a I'm not using his words but my memory of his words intellectual level and that this was incarnated into an actual life right which is so much the heart of the gospel right yeah so I I was astounded by that actually I please and felt like maybe Peterson has blazed a trail through some of this of going you know of walking into what they think about Christianity and publicly expressing it anyway sorry I cut you off no no no that's that's really interesting and flesh that out I had a part of the problem that I have is I so yesterday I had a conversation with a with a guy who I mean it's I it's so much fun being me I really feel a little selfish just because at a conversation with a guy who kind of mapped out he gave me his perspective on Peterson and Sam Harris and also Peterson and the biblical series about why that you know why that was such a breath of fresh air and when you said this I kind of got the sense that you were having a similar experience watching verveky talk about the Bible here and and so this individual I have yet to get permission to I think you will you will share the video but the point he made was that you know in again this fraughtness of the Bible in our culture when Christians talk about the Bible it's immediately dismissed because of you know they're supernaturalists let's say okay so it's immediately and then Sam Harris talks about the Bible everyone now sort of has the idea that okay Sam Harris is going to be immediately dismissive of the Bible and so when either side talks about the Bible everybody just it's map territory we've seen this movie before we you know we're done with it and then Peterson sort of steps in with his biblical series and in kind of a new innocence this is the book and it's really cool and he's not he's not part of the Christian tribe so he's not dismissed for that and he's not being dismissive like Sam Harris I'm not saying it anywhere as well as the guy who said it yesterday said it but but I you know I when you said it when you said what you said just now that's what I saw so I don't know if that's true I think it's completely true in fact I think it reveals that Sam Harris in the middle of the Christian culture he's arguing in a Christian way about the Bible but against it say more about that what do you mean in a Christian way well I think in some ways I don't know who I heard say this at something like years ago but that the new atheists were I think it was Roger Scruton when he was having a discussion with them it's on YouTube and Scruton makes the point that well you're a whole lot more religious than anyone on this side of the table talking to because the the tone of the discussion and the framework is almost like they're Sam Harris is like a Puritan yes yes right there's this it's the same tone right and and I think and I know this is gonna get fraught quickly with some people who watch my channel very faithfully there's a see Sam Harris and a whole group of Christians are kind of mirror opposites of each other it's a it's an epistemological foundationalism yeah and so all this whole this whole idea of what truth is now a video just came out with for Vickie doing a conversation with another guy it's not on her Vickie's channel Google served it up to me and verveky talks about the different aspects of truth in that video which I thought was really good and so that'll make an appearance of one of my videos soon but I think you're exactly right that we the the conversation had sort of been like this and Peterson kind of sidestepped this somehow and walked through the middle and said oh here's the Bible and everyone was kind of like I haven't seen that book before even those two these two sides have been going like this forever and for Vickie's for Vickie's video had some of that quality to it too a freshness absolutely yeah and I think maybe maybe Peterson's made like it okay again just to be straightforward it's amazing yeah go ahead so part of my history about that is that when I went through seminary this was a big interest for me is so I did this I did a project where I took down all the statements of faith from all the Canadian churches that I could find didn't take them down no and went okay so where are these statements of faith is there any direction to to love God no and I'm making a generalization that isn't fair to all of them right but and I'm saying this as a Christian that goes to church that right right right from that church right and I've been to many of them and love them but the statement is a faith are all polemical almost all their definitions of our our territory are how we define who we are separate from others and they all have good reasons and good and I I'm not I'm all for arguing theology and getting it right yep and and this sort of thing well actually so I'll tell you a brief story about my point of view I was in my church history class and our professor who's sweet man and but he was talking about the Reformation right and he was saying how it's it's a it's really sad how the church splits and you know but there was really important theological issues at stake right which we all agree with to some degree so I piped up because I guess I had a bit of an attitude about it at that moment I popped up and said well isn't isn't unity a theological issue yeah didn't Jesus pray for that in John 17 you know I'm maybe that was not the nicest thing to do in class exactly but I do believe that yeah and I believe there's a lot of harm we've done to people who are outside of the church yeah by being so polemical about it yeah so basically my final my capstone paper at the church was trying to bridge all of those to work on a way without being too postmodern about it to express the Christian message in a in a different kind of Christian in a different kind of service that expresses I don't want to go into it too far here but that I'm really interested in that issue how do we how do we show Christ and you quoted oh what was his name he was a retired missionary who came back from the field Leslie Newbigin Newbing it the church is the hermeneutic of the gospel right right yeah meaning the church the active community of the church right is expresses the gospel to the world around us properly and so I'm really interested in taking that literally well it's it's it's true it's just true and it's always and it's always been true so I when I went to when I went to Australia the conference that I'd be the person that invited me out his name is Warren Mills yeah Warren is a I don't know what degree he has he he's worked he got started sort of as a mechanic and then got into the auto industry in Australia and became a consultant and did a whole bunch of things throughout his whole life he's retired and he was quite he was quite successful in a lot of what he did but he's not an academician and he you know he did things like build his own race car because he wanted to try and do it he built his own travel trailer and he just enjoyed working with his hands and putting things together he's not an he would build something and then it was you know so it just that kind of guy and he and so then when he was retired he's like well what am I gonna do with myself because he's a guy who's always got to be doing something he's just a person so he decided to write and so he the first book he wrote would have which hasn't been published is about I forget the guy's name a Southern California the guy who basically created drag racing in California and and the second book he wrote which is published which I'll post a the book a section of the conference was essentially an introduction to his book which was all about the Golden Rule how you know basically how good is the Golden Rule right and I read I read about two-thirds of the book on the flight to Australia because it's a long flight and and but it's it's a really lovely book because he essentially makes the point that we often first of all because the churches he grew up in he never heard the Golden Rule expounded never heard a sermon about the Golden Rule it was at a dispensational church but then he went to other churches and began hearing it more but basically he figured out that the idea behind the Golden Rule was not just well this is what you do to qualify which is obviously something that the Reformation has been Protestants have been dealing with for a long time but it's also sort of a you know to use a verveky term a psycho technology that when you when you treat someone the way you'd like to be treated this changes you and usually the focus is on the other person but when you practice this and again it's the idea of the practice this changes you and that of course is love you know love the Lord your God with all your hearts all minds strike love your neighbor as yourself or what does love look like treat someone the way you'd like to be treated and I what it really struck me and again it's in the video that I just released today although who knows when I'll release this video but the you know the idea of the power of love to transform and I know some people some people really took offense when verveky describes you know you bring that little baby home from the hospital and you know what is that baby the baby the baby is non-functional in many ways the baby is all take from the mother from the father from its its complete need and demand yet you love the baby and what love does is turn the baby into a person now I'm not gonna get into regard of a person and all of those issues of abortion but yeah but it but that's what love does and there was a pastor in in Grand Rapids who one of his favorite illustrations he would go to was always the velveteen rabbit this this little book where the the rabbit becomes real by the love of the child and Toy Story is essentially the same point and and so you know I too had the same I you know even though verveky doesn't identify as a Christian much more identifies more as a Buddhist I thought his articulation of love and the power of love and agape was was was really profound and it's going to be interesting watching and and you know and your observation now that Peterson seemed to have opened something up and and verveky while he often you know if you watch his rebel wisdom conversation differentiates himself from Peterson in a number of ways and in this other video that I watched yesterday only got halfway through it's the story of my life only getting halfway through stuff but also differentiates himself from Peterson in a number of ways but but Peterson opened something up and the Bible seems to be walking through yeah well actually I I thought okay so Peterson's talking about logos and verveky's talking about agape and the verse that struck my mind which if you take both of what if you take what each one of them is saying in full seriousness and full strength the verse of speaking the truth in love takes on a much much bigger it's not just about you know being nice to people while you tell them that what they're doing wrong which is usually what churches do that's that's the you know that's the paredown to you know sort of polite light but there it's almost like they're both coming at the person of Christ in this in the way they're explaining it from two different directions well go ahead yeah I know I mean I don't I'm just gonna ramble on about it so please well and it's always struck me there's a there's a funny thing about Peterson in that logos is I just watched a video by there's there's a guy who has a channel all on young stuff and he and he just made a video of how Peterson and I get things wrong because we're too stuck on logos which I thought was funny because I don't think I've talked about it that much but but Peterson has and I've always thought it was kind of funny that when you look at Peterson's opening gambit and maps of meaning this this primary fork where he and Sam Harris diverge between a space the world as a space of object and a world as a form for action that agape and I got to be careful there because New Testament scholarship I mean there's all this technical stuff out there this is part of the reason that it's fraught and how much is agape you know about 30 years ago someone wrote a book that essentially made pretty hard fast differentiations between especially Filet-O-File and agape and New Testament doesn't always isn't always that precise with them but as as a as a schema as you know as kind of a mapping I always thought it was funny that for Peterson even though he he really goes with the world as a form for action and that's foundational for his map of meaning that agape doesn't have isn't isn't more out there than logos and and so you know it maybe that's just because of the cultural fight that Peterson's trying to But if the world is a form for action at the top of the Christian hierarchy is not really truth it's love and and you know you don't want to you don't want to separate truth from love but the point is love more than truth yeah I think so but I read it in the same thing so basically in the person of Christ right So in the incarnate person of Christ it is both the way and the truth and is the incarnation of God's love right and so way the truth and the life way is of course action yeah you know that that's the that's the primary focus on way but it's you know no one did I am the way the truth of life no one comes to the father except through me which again is one of these just audacious things that Jesus says yeah which which you know a bunch of skeptical scholars have to get out of Jesus mouth because if you leave that in Jesus mouth Jesus is this enormous problem that CS Lewis faces full-on and says you know if you're if you're just gonna demythologize Jesus what's the point and for Venky for Venky quoted this right not to not to confuse the conversation jump around too much but for a vacay quoted him as describing himself as the way that's right that's right I was like okay well what's been what's been fascinating I just kicked the table what's been fascinating me about verve keys mission here has been all of the tools that he is you know handing out along the way and and people are like well you know because his first the first course video course was Buddhism and cognitive psychology so a whole bunch of conservative Christians are gonna look at that and say put the Buddhist label on him and say no thank you and that's a mistake I think and it's the same mistake that Christians make seeing Peterson and they put the young label on him or the Darwin label and say no thank you that's a mistake and let let him let them do their thing and get you know especially as they're dropping tools along the way and energizing your community don't don't ignore that no I really love the way you talk about this and talk about it in terms of language and because I think part of that is comes out of you were talking before about the you know the all the confessions that churches have but their loyalty to those and the way of understanding our our Christianity no we've had kind of a common experience and you can correct me but like my experience in going to Cuba and being involved with Cuban Christians I think kind of informs my opinion about about how to listen to Peterson and verve key and really anyone else because when we first went down there we went down there with the attitude we were coming to teach and to help right and because well if you have money and other people don't have money there's all I and I slowly became aware of all the implied arrogance that go along with that right over over a few years yeah my wife is a little bit faster in the uptake on the but once we once we got to know things down there when we brought some missions groups down to do to do work to clear out spaces to put on children's programs this sort of thing but I would tell people to to watch watch what happens when you just listen to how they interact with with Christ with salvation and watch what happens to your own awareness of what you're carrying in your culture now Cuban Spanish culture is is different than Canadian or even California and I would expect but it's not there's still like Western and so it's not completely different but in that kind of like overlap you begin to like shed a little bit of oh I was carrying this as part of my idea about Christianity or that I'm sorry I can't put something to mind draw something to mind but you for me I got a much much clearer picture in my mind about what the core of my salvation is and who Christ is by seeing it through someone else's eyes and allowing that to trim away some of what I carried in my church cultures and Canadian culture and you know that sort of thing and it's such a delight yeah yeah well it's that's so true of you know you know meeting vibrant Christians from another culture the you do you do get a the two overlays you begin to gain some insights it's you know I your and your comment too about taking all of that because if you go to if you go to websites you can pull the doctrinal statements from different churches and then actually evangelical pastors tend to their doctrinal statements they usually cut and paste from other churches doctoral statements because they you know if you're a Christian Reformed Church you might say oh there it's the it's the Heideberg Catechism the Belgian Confession and the canons of Dor and the Apostles Creed the Nicene Creed and the Athanasian Creed and you know you can put those on your website and no one will read them so what churches often do is they take like these 15 points that are kind of some basic evangelical points about we believe in the Bible we believe in the we believe the Bible is the Word of God we believe that Jesus died for our sins so okay and and what's really helpful about those is that gives you then sort of a cultural hash a cultural heuristic of okay this is the approach to the gospel and and whereas I don't want to it's easy listening to me to imagine to to buy a stereotype of the work of the church that it is all loss and it is all failure and that's by no means the truth because churches churches are doing outreach and evangelism every day and people are joining churches and being baptized and professing faith that is all happening as we speak but in terms of the overall trend you know everyone has noticed a you know a continual decline in the effort in the F the efficacy of the standard tools that evangelicals have been using when DJ Kennedy Kennedy wrote evangelism explosion and people would go door to door with the question if you were to die tonight what would you say to Jesus to let him into for him to let you into his heaven that is so framed in a you know that is so that that that is so dependent upon a frame that many of us now clearly see is no longer there and that movement is recognizing that movement is important if you're a pastor but then the question is what is the frame we're currently working with and what does that frame allow and not allow and I think what's interesting about Peterson and and now with these videos from verveky we're seeing again but you know in contrast we're beginning to be able to pick out the frame because the lightning comes on and we get a glimpse of a shadow and we say oh and and we watch it and we watch other people and I think what this means is that and I have a I have a lot of nervousness about saying this that we're going to continue to see the we're going to see the church's language continue to evolve and that frightens people in the church because churches have very much dependent been dependent upon creating a certain language and the culture from coming from that language and that language being used to preserve the culture but what happens is the background keeps changing and so the words don't mean what they used to mean and they're not heard like they used to be heard and you know actually it's good news for theologians and pastors the fight is involved in that everyone is trying to work it out and all of their attempts are competing and so the whole thing is fraught and and so then it is really amazing when you have people who are in no way expected to be Christian coming out and doing these kinds of things and then the response to it is renewed interest in Christianity there's probably talk too long I don't know if it's helpful at all but just thinking out loud no no well me too because I think this is the challenge of the church faces is how to describe what how do you describe what your church is doing to someone who's never been in the church and that was my problem I wasn't complaining about the fact that we have good theology in our statements of faith right to someone who's outside of the church who's used to reading corporate you know met like corporate goals like this is what this company is about is we are gonna do this and that and the other thing a statement of faith doesn't do that for people right and I also think that part of the the harm that's come I don't know how to express this well but part of the harm that's come from us having this internal Christendom argument about who's in who's out and all the various arguments we've had is the argument kind of takes place in the air right I know there's arguments about what we should do on the ground but a lot of the argument ends up being in the in the in the in the intellectual space and in if you like the spiritual space what does it mean to be saved etc etc so that when it comes to what a church should actually be doing or what I as a Christian should be doing it's like a second-order issue it like what I should be doing in this world and I think part of the strength and part of the attraction of what Peterson's doing even for Christians you could see that Liberty University wanted them there because half the students after students are reading ever yeah yeah but I don't know how nice their student body already so you better bring him in the door and try and colonize him right he's telling people how to act in the world or giving some guidelines about how to act in the world based on scriptural principles largely directly not second order right now well you know what I mean right I think like usually a church if I was on a church board you're talking about it to decide how you're gonna do something or what you're gonna do that often goes there's often about three steps of logic to actually what happens on the ground and maybe that's not maybe that's not wrong but it's not very direct well yeah this is all so hard but you know and I wrestle with this it's been so funny because as a pastor you know I do these so I now have this new experience having done videos where I do these videos and I do these meetups and people so people watch my videos and then people come to the meetups and then every now and then someone from the videos and the meetups will kind of wander into church yeah and they're you know they might not even know why they're there they're just curious and they're kind of like well you know most people kind of understand that you can wander into a church and probably nothing bad is gonna happen in most churches yeah people are gonna be polite and well behaved and you can just sit in a seat and watch and not have to comment and then sneak out earlier shake the hand with the pastor and say oh thank you this was interesting and then get the heck out of there yeah but you know part of what part of what I'm trying to do is and this is what I've always done so I'm watching Peterson and I'm watching verveky and I'm I'm thinking through all of these things then I've got my church life over here and now there's a there is a filter for me that I do understand what we do in church and there's a tradition there that that needs to be respected and I have a job to do in that sense I'm a professional I am I am I am and I'm not trying to get you in trouble no no that's right but at the same time other people notice through my rough drafts they're like you know Peterson is kind of leaking into your pastor stuff yeah that's right and I want that actually to happen but the filter for me is is really what I'm always working on because I have to figure out how I just have to process all of this stuff and and and that I think on a global level is is what is happening or a much larger level is what is happening with with the church and these things because we do know that you know the ideas out there in the world do impact churches in their cultures one way or another for better or for worse they always do and no matter how churches try to try to preserve whatever it is that they they sense is the the genuine article whether that comes in you know inerrancy of Scripture or a confessional statement or even a non-credo confessional statement like no creed but Christ the creeds in Christ are always because of culture continuing to morph and move and change and you see that when you go to Cuba because you will you know Christ is there you recognize Christianity and the the genuineness of their faith you will never be a Cuban Christian and you wouldn't want to be but the interchange informs you and when you come back you know you don't come back the same no that's right and you almost meet Christ in a new way yes right which is fantastic so I mean I think for people that are are exploring computer set over bake here some culmination of that I mean at the end of at the end point and I guess I'm pretty big on God number two is meeting Christ is is so much more than and that's what I was trying to kind of get at by you know you can go up this kind of logos path or you can go up the agape path but Christ is all those things and more and I don't know how well we do making that the hermeneutic well you mean so okay love love is boy love is really hard by definition agape is costly and part of what's difficult about love is there are there are false loves along the way and you in fact love love is always informed by truth so I'll use you know I've used Daniel you know the homeless alcoholic who I suspect is actually dead because he hasn't shown up and I suspect when he got out of jail he probably took his life but so so when you know when did for those six years Daniel I could not give get Daniel to live anywhere else but literally against the door to my office the question then is every day when I come into work and I have to rouse him and whatever state he's in just to get into my office to go to work and Sunday mornings when of course I would open the door and he would come in to make himself a little bit of breakfast in the kitchen and you know and and you know praise God this is a church that could deal with Daniel and and the first week didn't say pastor you call the police and you get rid of him I mean no one there way too many families in this church that have disabled children and grandchildren that when they saw Daniel they they knew that you know there but for the grace of God would go their son or their daughter so so we we could not exercise Daniel and remove him from our space we had to learn to live with Daniel but then the question is how do we love Daniel and there are a lot of difficult truths with respect to him with respect to his alcoholism and his drug use and his mental illness and and so love we usually look for it where we look for the expedient often and so the expedient is sometimes the police are expedient because they remove Daniel from the scene a handout is expedient because it satisfies the immediate desire of the person it's it's oh there's a there's a facile application of the golden rule you know if I were a a homeless alcoholic you know drug user and I say give me ten dollars so I'll have beer for the day you'll make me happy by giving me ten dollars the question is is that love and so and and this is we as human beings run into the question of what does love require in these terribly complex fraught interpersonal relationships every parent deals with that every you know every schoolteacher every pastor anyone who deals with people has to deal with that question and it's often the case that the the answer is not obvious and usually the most correct answer is costly and well you know I was a foster parent for many years so I know what you're talking about that if you sometimes you just don't know what the right answer is and actually I thought of that where Reveke was talking about you know you take a little child and you love them and that's how you make a person and like yeah love is not hard on you know a blank slate as he was describing it right it's not you know it's not easy for parenting not easy period right but it's workable or it's workable and doable for just good people right but to take someone like the homeless person Daniel or to in some cases some some foster children that we had or anyone that is has been harmed in this world substantially for them to go through that to experience the transformation that Reveke was talking about the experience that that takes something more and I don't mean I'm not trying to give myself credit here and I'm not it takes something more from somewhere else it it takes something transcendent to happen it also takes you being there with in my opinion with hands and feet and providing at least safety but to undo that damage I mean that's the point of the gospel right if there was no fall then all we would need was for gate for gatekeeper for Vakey's a description of a God pain that's that's how I that's it was running through my head when he was talking but when people are broken they don't receive about they don't receive love very well they if there's all kinds of barriers up and that's that was our experience in in fostering and with sometimes it turned out beautifully and and and God made a difference at some point and then all of a sudden everything worked and sometimes it didn't happen yeah you know at both things well that that is I mean I really like how you phrased it because in some ways that is the definition of perdition of lostness is an inability to receive love an inability to recognize love and you know especially as say a foster parent I mean you're right you bring that baby home from the hospital especially if it's your now we even know now with respect to adoption that even if it's a two or three week old baby that has been separated from her mother that there is already a wound that you know and which is something that just blows us away because we do think of that baby as a blank slate and we don't understand the deep ways that we're connected with each other yeah and and so as a foster as a foster parent you bring it a child with some trouble into your home and you know you and your wife are doing everything you can in all sincerity to love the child with the wisdom and truth that you have and you get resistance and you understand resistance because I mean it's it's it's enormously complex yeah and and I think you know one of the ways to one of the ways to understand the you know you can bring that all the way back into Genesis 3 where a sit you mean all that the the little sentence that Satan gives the man and the woman the one question he gives them is the seed of cynical doubt in the goodness of God the serpent basically suggests that God is being the irony is that it's an appeal to justice by being cynical about God's justice calling it injustice and that sets that sets the path of the world in the story Wow and and and so here you know in a sense you see you know Adam and Eve could not accept God's and and in terms of the Christian gospel those who you know reject the gospel in a sense refuse God's love and then again the irony if you're a foster parent is you you play through that script again and again and again and you now of wife are not infallible and you know you're but but you you again and again and again you try to to to work with the child and say this is love it might not look like love to you right now but you know try and accept it if you can no you know oh yeah and you know when when it's on a knife edge like that and you know you've made mistakes just going back to your not a infallible point you know I feel guilty about joking around about it but you know and when you know you've made mistakes when someone it feels like someone's on the knife edge of trust or not trust and that's really that's really tough that's really tough you know I know I'm oversimplifying but there's something about something about you know you were expressing the book that the gentleman had written from Australia about the about living at the Golden Rule and then you talked about how complicated it is and I resonate with that completely I think everyone that tries knows this I think maybe the disciples the Apostles cycles knew this in the upper room after Jesus was gone and had taught them that they have to love they I don't I don't think they were confused about this but to me and maybe it's my Pentecostalism coming out but to me it is the Holy Spirit that is supposed to help us navigate the complexity of the sort of the love first if you will that's a terrible phrase but to navigate the complexity of people and the damage and all those things I think that's that's actually the entire point but that's a huge part of what the what the point is of the Holy Spirit I know it's basic theology but just in the context of our conversation I think it's important well and and you're probably you know in terms of videos that I think I'll probably be doing you never know because circumstances come up and I get distracted and go somewhere else but I've spent a lot of time because I've been in the book of first John in my adult Sunday school class and that's kind of the the seedbed of a lot of stuff that I do and it's not on my normal channel it's on my church channel but you know I've been doing a lot of thinking about what we mean by spirit and what the Holy what the Holy Spirit if there's other words we can use to describe the Holy Spirit and the action that it does and this is where a lot of the Peterson verveky stuff a lot of the tools that they've dropped along the way have been helpful in terms of finding new language because you know it's it's so interesting in in in John 13 where Jesus is about to show them his love and so he strips down wraps a towel around himself and washes their feet and that is in a sense that we're gonna avoid the Catholic Protestant fight over sacraments but that is in a sense of sacrament what he does right there in that he he now in a physical tangible way embodies and incarnates love in that culture in that moment in that context and of course it's noteworthy that Peter that that Peter you know speaking for the group likely you know Peter in many times in the gospel is he's the oldest disciple is therefore the the preeminent disciple he will speak for the group so often when Peter speaks all of the say speaking for all of them you know no you know I will I will not let you love me in this way it is beneath you and I will not allow you to humiliate yourself like this so he's you know so that we're status and I could imagine Jesus in the back of his mind is thinking you have no idea how far I will go to allow myself to be humiliated for you right and and suddenly there is love and you know and and it is and that is the that is the agape that for Vicky is is speaking about that that this is it is not the abstract concept it is not only the word it is when agape gets incarnate I use often the illustration of a friend of mine who he asked me to do his mother's funeral and he was a you know he was a he's a black man grew up in in in Watts and LA you know probably most of the kids in his neighborhood are dead or in now and his mama you know kept him in church made sure he did his schoolwork and you know scrubbed floors you know they did did whatever demeaning job she could so her boy would have a chance and so when I'll tell you when he he was he's a very successful man and but he he loved his mama and he made sure she always had enough and was always taken care of and then when she died she had absolutely the best funeral he could have and he had political connections so you know they were dignitaries and all kinds of he he pulled in all his favors and said you're gonna be at my mama's funeral and it's gonna be a celebration because of what she did for me and that is all about love and it's all around us we see it and every mother every good mother that sacrifices for her child you know every mother has the child at the risk of her life sometimes at the cost of her life and so this is built in and and and it's you know the the world recognized love differently after Jesus and and that changed the world and I think I loved when he noted because I you know it conquered the Roman Empire love conquered the Empire and it's not like you're a key says it sounds trite to us but it's never trite when we see it incarnated when we see it manifest in front of us no absolutely absolutely I like what you talked about it being about the sacramental nature of that yeah and I think you know then you know obviously the the Christian sacraments you know of the Eucharist of the Lord's Supper I don't know did you see I posted on Twitter this Peter Kreeft was on Eric Metaxas show and you know and Kreeft gets I love Peter Kreeft even though he broke the heart of all the Calvin College philosophers when he converted to Catholicism but oh you might notice that he loves Chesterton oh he does love Chesterton yeah but you know it's it's this you know the Lord's Supper is this is love you know it's love expressed in bread and wine actually I had suspected what he was taught what he talked about as the reason for that the the Catholic understanding and the way they framed it based on the Aristotelian forms I had thought that for quite a long time and maybe I'd read it somewhere and forgot where I read it and it was just a thought hanging around that was delighted to hear him go through that and because it's not like literally it's something it's literal but it's a different literal that's exactly the problem with the word literal everyone uses that word and it's like what do you really mean by that word because I don't think you I don't think it means what you think it means so and and I mean it gets into and I think you know Jonathan Peugeot one of the real gifts that I think he gives us is he Jonathan has a way of framing some of this stuff in a very in a very powerful way that you know when Jesus says this is my body well you know you don't have to be Bill Clinton to ask the question what do you mean by is that is perhaps the question of of you have Western civilization of this whole thing you know what is the definition of is what is being oh yeah yeah I know it's beautiful and this is well actually I don't know why I started to think but Zizek so I think he was lying I don't think it's a different theologian or Kierkegaard theologist whatever I think his first favorite theologist is Hegel yeah Hegel gosh philosophy and Hegel essentially I mean there's a there's and Verbeke gets into this in his first lecture when he talks about Hebrew narrative once once you have an autobiographical narrative you're going to have a stories progress when stories don't progress they're not stories and so you're going to have a progressivism built into the West period but then the question is always what exactly is the story about because that's the narrative line in which there will be progress and and then also what is the telos what is the end of the story what is the story pointing to that really matters and so that's where you know in a sense truth and truth and love they're right in there because the story is about love and the story points to love the story is also about truth and the story points to truth yeah yeah oh Zizek Zizek you know now since watching that thing I've seen a few other videos of his and tended to read a book or two but I part of me listens to him and thinks he is the definition he is the embodiment of he may be not I'm not sure he may be the embodiment of of when Vervecky talks about Frankfurters bullshit he's all is all he's doing sometimes when he's talking is bullshitting in that he's it's hard to tell yes it's hard to tell is and so my question for him is is it is it just pure bullshit in in this in the philosophical sense or because if in a sense if there is no string that holds the pearls together and gives the pearls cohesion that's the difference between bullshitting and actually you know doing something CS Lewis and the in the screw tape letters has the devil's basically say you know the way you capture a human soul is to just to add the bullshitting line is basically to bullshit someone for their whole entire life and you make their life you make their life literally pointless there's no point to their life you just keep them busy with amusements and that's a terribly dangerous thing for our age that now via the internet has has no end of amusements that we can fill ourselves with absolutely so that's why I thought about Hagle as a religious figure he's a very religious figure absolutely is it's basically a replacement religion right it's a living Christianity and and telling a new meta narrative at least as far as I understand it and so you know I listen to Zizek talk about two of my favorite writers and mess around with what they were saying for Peterson's benefit or to be funny or to probe Peterson I wasn't sure yeah because there was there's a sense in which Peterson's approach to faith is pretty similar to it's kind of cute guardian right in fear and trembling it's very hard to have faith you're just stepping up to the end right it's and I've wondered if Peterson's read a lot of cure-cure guard and then he's also said some Peters has also said some things that I thought were rated at Chesterton before but he didn't seem like he'd read when Zizek brought it up didn't seem like he read her orthodoxy or anything no I don't think I don't think Peter if Peterson has read has read Chesterton I don't think he's integrated him I again my read on Peterson said a lot about my read on Peterson I I think he's I think he's a modernist and and in a sense his Christianity is very deeply tied to 1960s 1960s mainline the type of thing that you'd find and let's say some readings of neo-orthodoxy but you know there's Jung and there's Piaget Piaget is is a big influence on Peterson more than because he Peterson basically gets his eschatology from Piaget okay I mean whenever Peterson trots out his equilibrated state that's that's Peterson's kingdom of God city on the hill that's that's it for Peterson yeah the and so then what Peterson is constantly striving to do then is to embody that in his life and I think part of the reason he he prays he asked for the prayer request at Liberty that he did was it's it's in a sense all on him and all on us and that is the that is the heart I think of the of the modernist position and and that is that is taking one very definite take from this this this question of agency that we haven't been able to penetrate yeah absolutely no I just I thought that G Jack was picking some writers out who he thought were maybe influential to Peterson and I think he was also trying to do like a circle around like just a demonstration of his philosophical breadth and depth yeah and and I and since it was Good Friday which I thought was the oddest thing it was did that okay so it's Good Friday and they're talking about the crucifixion the Z Jack is anyway yes yes and I don't know I thought you know what I immediately thought of there's this sermon I forget I think I forget who was referring to it someone that my wife and I met Tony Campolo referring to being in a sermon competition at his home church yep yeah the guy preaching ahead of him was preaching it's Friday but Sunday is coming right yeah right so I don't know that was running through my head immediately after watching the Peterson G Jack thing I'm going how do we get these guys to Sunday this Friday's not good enough well that's there's there's a whole lot of folks that are working on Peterson yeah you're gonna colonize him carrying your cross up a hill doesn't always end well no no they put the cross up and they put you on it yeah that's what's at the top of the hill it's good to have a plan for a couple days later I'm sorry I'm being channeling my inner Z Jack there but no I'm interested I hope that Peterson reads Orthodoxy because there's a lot in there yeah well Chesterton you know so so Peter Kreeft talked about Chesterton as philosopher in his talk with Eric Metaxas which I thought was very interesting yeah yeah Peterson I think just like all of us the the the the events of his life that he cannot control will have more say in the final definitive story of his life than than even many of our aspirations yeah well I I just have so much respect for his approach is it's such a grounded approach yeah and it's making I mean it's it's marvelous but the reason I mentioned Chesterton I'm sorry I know a bit stuck on Chesterton is because you know we were talking earlier about the ground about the groundedness of Peterson and Erveke in in various sciences so Orthodoxy in my reading there's no there in Chesterton's writing there's not a lot of separation between how you act in the world and the philosophical theory in fact within a paragraph it's back and forth and back and forth so there's a real vertical integration to steal word out of industry yeah in in Chesterton's thought because he's not a formally trained theologian or philosopher right he's it really was it his experience is a ground-up experience and it's not reductionist it's really really solid in in so many ways and refreshing so that that's why I'm a huge fan of his not that I think everything he says is right and he's a little bit hard on some Christian groups he's just so much fun you know and there's that too but anyway well we've gone for we've gone for over an hour now so we should uh the guy that I had a guy signed up for 11 o'clock and he canceled so okay well I don't have much more to probably get back to work yep I should probably work on my sermon but but thank you Chris and yeah yeah I have to so before I do a video on something like you know that that next I've only watched the episode 16 of verveky's thing I've only watched it once I usually watch it two or three or four or six times before I do a video on it because when I watch it it's you know it sinks in deeper and deeper and I hear things I didn't hear the first time and just my picture of it gets clearer but I you know yeah you know so Peterson sort of opened this door and you know verveky is is however he feels about it is part of the mix and yeah we're all where's all this stuff going I don't know but it's sure an interesting ride it's pretty exciting it is very exciting thank you for your time oh thank you Chris you take care you too bye bye
