 Hi, this is Paul. One of the things that I've noted after three years is the, is it a condition? Is it Jordan Peterson obsession? Something that certainly I have been either accused of or maybe even guilty of. Maybe even Jordan Peterson possession. What would Jordan Peterson possession means? And we all sort of know the symptoms. Watching endless hours of Jordan Peterson and can't get enough of him. Now many of us had this condition three years or so ago and one way or another he became sort of map territory in terms of our minds and the condition subsided. But now that we're three years into this and especially with what happened between the Times and Jordan and Michaela Peterson, I made a video about that quite recently, I think it's a good time to take a look at some of these things. Why did Jordan have that power? And again if you look at my video that I made about how I got into this stuff, about the desire for honest conversations, what was it about Peterson that really captivates? And even still I had a little private DM loop with some other YouTubers and one of them made the comment that you know whenever he does a video with Jordan Peterson and the name bang up go his analytics and that certainly is very true for me. You can just look at my channel and see that that's abundantly clear. Jordan Peterson is much more interesting than I am. But I have to look at myself with this and I have to ask the question what about this man has driven this and why? What's going on? And in some ways that's been the question that I've had about him the whole time. What the hell is going on? And in fact that's a little clip of him in a question-and-answer asking that question. What on earth is going on? We watched hours and hours and listened to hours and hours and we risked reputation and friendships because we felt we discovered transformational truths that we couldn't deny and had to somehow bear witness through truthful speech. This little picture if you're watching the YouTube of when Jordan visited Liberty University and the convocation and this this young man rushes the stage he just has to talk to Peterson. I mean he what wouldn't he risk to talk to Peterson? Now it's not just preachers that have had this experience it's journalists too and two of the journalists that I think have been most helpful to listen to through this are David Fuller and Tim Lott both of them from the UK and David Fuller of course is one of the founders and one of the main wheels behind the YouTube channel Rebel Wisdom and David Fuller quite early on found Jordan Peterson and just really in anticipation of the wave got in and did the glitch and the glitch in the matrix that video that really helped well it put both of them on the map because I mean David Fuller has again a background in journalism and Tim Lott, Tim Lott also another another serious journalist had an early interview with Peterson on Christianity and the resurrection and then that conversation was I think again a really a foundational conversation where Jordan I mean he's at that point he's still you know he's still like me just a regular guy not really caring what he wears or how long he lets his beard grow when he's talking on YouTube because what doesn't matter he hadn't really been attacked yet he hadn't really been you know scrutinized and put under the microscope well maybe I should take a lesson from Peterson and be a little more careful although I really don't think I am going to ride the same kind of status ride as Jordan status rocket as Jordan Peterson and actually I certainly hope not we can see some of what that has cost Jordan Peterson so both David both David Fuller and and Tim Lott took a deep dive into Peterson now in the wake of the of the Times piece on Peterson entitled a broken man David Fuller has these I don't know what to call them they're basically big zoom meetings with the rebel wisdom members I think they're called and they talk about these things and again I was on one of those not too long ago I really appreciate what David is doing not just in terms of making video content but what he's you know I think David and Ali have a lot of integrity and I think they're they're really working hard to help people and and both Tim Lott and David Fuller are two of the more two people whose approach to all of this I deeply respect and and I think they have they have approached it in the best way now the whole video if you haven't watched Jordan Peterson in the media the whole video is worth watching I'll give a little warning to those of you who haven't seen the other video I regularly get comments that well whether I'm reading a newspaper article or reading a chapter from a book or commenting on a video that I keep interrupting the video to add my comment this is a commentary video that's what I'm doing so if you're annoyed by my comments turn it off here go back and watch the video if you're interested in my comments this is the video for you part of what we're dealing here is sort of an implicit messianism that that Jordan Peterson is a Messiah or not necessarily he himself but he has the words of life to to riff on John 6 I've told the story before that a colleague of mine back in in 2017 when I was doing the Jordan Peterson dive found himself doing the Jordan Peterson dive and pulled out of it because I said I'm listening to more Jordan Peterson than I'm reading the Bible and I kind of chuckle about that but I respect it because what that pastor recognizes is that we can all get obsessed or possessed or colonized by by ideas and and my you know I'm a little I'm a little subject to this for those of you who can't tell because when I find an idea that's interesting or and I find something that's puzzling I tend to latch on pretty strongly and I hold on to it and I won't let it go until I figure it out and then usually I'll let it go or at least come to some kind of resolution where in terms of the mapped unmapped territory dynamic I you know I hit I hit a point where I say okay well I think I think I know that time to move on to something else so this this conversation here I'm just gonna play a some some of the clip from the middle of it gets into this because my point is not so much to complain about people like myself or David Fuller or Tim Lott who've done the deep Jordan Peterson dive many of you who subscribe to my channel have have taken the dive too but but to ask about the dynamics and ask about what we want and in the video I made about Jordan Peterson and the idols of Babylon and the fiery furnace that video was very helpful for me to make because it illuminated the idealized image that we collectively create and promote and distribute which media has a big part of distributing that that that we all sort of check ourselves against and long for and wish for it's it's in some ways the the mentally socially culturally constructed heaven that we all sort of agree with now again to get a get to get a sense of what human community is and how it works there's very much something like that that we're all we're all sort of leaning into something we're all on a journey towards something we're all moving in anticipation of something and obviously for some of us Jordan Peterson was a big part of that and so then to have the times portray him as a broken man well you've just you've just attacked our savior or you've just attacked the bearer of the message that is our salvation or and this is part of the reason people on all sides get triggered and outraged and and and get upset about things so let's let's let's jump into the video a bit David Fuller was talking about how the negative media attention the cycle is likely going to make them more guarded with respect to their capacity to basically reflect transparently and in public on themselves and as as David Fuller noted this has been one of the more boy this stuff gets deep in terms of media culture and collective cognition and all the ways that we we try to piece our world together but but it'll it'll likely make them more guarded and and put them Jordan and Michaela in the family and and they very much seem Jordan and Michaela in the family very much seem to sort of approach this as a family business which is another interesting aspect of it but but it but it will make them more guarded and and this again for David one of the if you watch a bunch of his stuff as I have and especially a bunch of the things where he talks about it I mean he was very much looking for a movement that could in and see if I say an integral way I don't mean that in terms of integral so if you watch a lot of his channel say ah integral theory well yes but also in a comprehensive way the polarities and tensions of our culture could be productively addressed and and we could hopefully in this process get at truth and and have better conversations yeah I mean the the structure of the release transcript showed that there was a conversation with with Jordan and then there was a conversation with Michaela that she had with Decker basically because she felt that now now the the conversation actually as Mary had pointed out in the comment Mary Cohen had pointed out the comment on my video that I made the order of that conversation was reversed it sure seemed like ms Michaela had the first conversation where she kind of went through a bunch of the background because as Michaela says it it it bothers Jordan to to rehearse this and it takes a lot out of him so she was doing a lot of that with the reporter but that then focuses on the interplay between them when Jordan talks about his illness it puts him into a into a bad space for a couple of days afterwards I mean my concern I guess with that is that it's difficult to see how they won't become far more guarded with with stuff like maybe they're blaming themselves for mentioning the schizophrenia thing and having that taken out of context and then if you start second-guessing that anything that you say and all of the medical details that you give might be taken out of context and might be misrepresented that it'll just lead to a sort of cycle of increased defensiveness and increased yeah retreat which sorry to interrupt you it one month shouldn't forget that Jordan is an academic you know and therefore what he deals in is detail and he thinks I sometimes imagine that if you just give people enough facts and detail that they're going to be better informed and that's really not the way the media world works what and again a lot of what's really good about this conversation is is both David Fuller and Tim Lotz background in the media and so they bring that expertise and you know to Tim Lotz gonna comment on the point he just made as a journalist but again as a pastor that's something that you see as a pastor all the time because pastors have sort of a side of themselves that's an academic and people have often commented that in my conversations with pastors we just have rooms lined with books yes we do because we read a lot of books but one of the difficult things for pastors to deal with is that more information is just more information it's not necessarily what what captivates or grabs people's hearts and journalists know this and again we have an attention economy and I think a lot of what Tim Lott will say in this video about journalism is is very true and very perceptive and very critical of the the current state of journalism happens when you give them a lot of facts and detail where the reliable or unreliable is they get bored and you know move on to something else having formed a having formed a stereotypical position so you know he's got a great faith in reason I think and that you know even though I think from my far as I can see the medical treatment was not always based in reason I don't know I don't know that's a real mystery to me I mean it remains a mystery at the end of the story okay and I talked quite a bit of that because I think that is another aspect of this story that is that is deeply true now where Tim Lott is gonna go with this though I think is important because this is where we get into another aspect of my video conversations where I talk about the miraculous because in terms of the conversations that we have about miracles and the miraculous that the focus tends to be sort of in a philosophical abstract way about the the laws of nature being violated but I think the dynamic of the miraculous in terms of how it colonizes us and how it persuades us and how it molds us and changes us really doesn't have much of anything at all to do with breaking the laws of physics or or or or how we define a miracle I think it has everything to do with again Jordan Peterson says in terms of his cognitive science I mean we see opportunities and obstacles the power of the miraculous are opportunities the power of the miraculous is that oh here is a way I can be saved well saved from what well again to get back into the question of consciousness consciousness is a month is a monofocal function and I've again talked quite a bit about consciousness of unity and then that creates a duality and then sometimes a Trinity and I think beyond three we just sort of go over into the many but but that I think the power that obsessed and possessed us was a sense that Jordan somehow was giving us an indication that he was he had an idea or he had the truth or he had a way of relieving deep dissonance that was not only in our individual selves but again I think one of the huge contributions that Jung made and this is you know part of my deep takeaway from Jung is that the story inside and the story outside are part of a continuous story and that isn't to downplay the border Tom Holland just did a very interesting podcast on borders and walls the rest is history podcast but the the the story inside and the story outside if you get someone like Peterson who seems to in that moment really touch something very deep and central to the story inside and the story outside we're going to hone in on it and again the one video I made that I know Jordan Peterson watched because I know he tweeted it was the video I made about why young people watch the office and that was that was one of my very early videos and and it was it was similar to you know I had gotten that idea because Jordan Peterson was looking at these Disney movies and I was thinking about the father of five children and I would I would watch my children read books over and over and over and over and over again and watch movies over and over and over and over again and then when my children were in their teen years they were watching the office over and over and over and over again and well why why so obsessively why so compulsively well you that if you ask them they'll say well I just like it but what's going on psychologically well obviously there's something about the drama and and all of that stuff that is helping them work on the story inside and the story outside and the point of that video about the office was that each of the characters in the office Michael Dwight Jim and Pam all of the odd all the characters in the office in some ways were archetypal figures or or proxy figures of archetypes or representations of people out there in the culture and so what that what that situation comedy managed to do was take the world and bring it down into an office and process it there and and so you know the the office you know did some poking at politically at political correctness because of course Michael Scott was his archetype was the anti-PC guy but he was different from Dwight remember Dwight saw Michael as a hero but Dwight was much more of the authoritarian whereas Michael Scott was the fool and so what was happening there is that we're processing the broader world by taking it inside mapping it inside comparing it against our first draft and processing processing it internally okay now now how does that how then do we come back to Jordan Peterson and find what was going on here what the hell was going on there I mean I you know I don't I mean without getting into the content I believe it is your view David that you know and I'm tempted to agree that you know the poor man was much more afflicted by a kind of physical nervous breakdown physically expressed nervous breakdown and then autoimmune disease but I don't know I'm not a doctor I'm not a psychologist but he you know it seemed a bit crazy yeah I think this would be a good time to just add in a little bit more context before we go to the Q&A which is that there were lots of valid questions like lots of the things that were asked in the interview are really valid questions like the the medical history the kind of jetting off to Russia being put in into an induced coma going out to Serbia all of these things that the journalists asked and said look you're you're well known as kind of scientific man why are you effectively choosing therapies which clearly don't have a scientific basis for etc and he he does he does answer those but the one thing but there's a lot of questions that I would love to ask him there are a lot of yeah there are a lot of I think fair criticisms or questions that I would like to ask him and that I've kind of been holding back on because I wanted to ask them to him personally like I wanted to have the opportunity partly because he was he was in such a bad way for a while and it felt sort of inappropriate and one of them is the thing that you can hear the journalist ask at some points which is you're giving all of these medical reasons but surely there's more to it than that like that whole story arc of kind of exploding into into the public eye the sort of becoming this lightning rod for the culture war and then this incredible arc of then what happened to him over the last couple of years like I don't I don't I don't think that for him you know in some ways he's asking he's asking the the Jesus question that that Islam really points at Christianity what kind of Savior gets crucified I like my I like my culture war heroes uncrucified I like my culture war heroes victorious and and many people with respect to Jordan and his his crash let's say and and here there's a you know what what Tim and David are sort of picking up on is can can we really just write it off as medical because hmm part of the part of the the messianic halo around Jordan was a transcending of a bunch of categories and this this gets into this gets into the question of the medicalization of of mental illness because again this has had on one of my previous videos one of the things that that struck me as I was doing conversations with people who of course found my YouTube channel after watching a lot of Jordan Peterson and the algorithm pointed them my way and they listened to something and they subscribed and they went deeper and on and on I discovered that many of the people who had taken the Jordan Peterson deep dive were testifying to the effect that especially watching his biblical series they felt better they had been suffering from depression many of them followed his his diet into this and just watching the videos made them feel better okay well how what what were the videos doing for me how how were those videos squaring the story outside with the story inside and and and how does that then impact again part of part of what I initially really drew me to Peterson was sort of this and I think he gets a lot of this from Jung this this capacity to transcend well the big divide between heaven and earth that this capacity to transcend sort of the the no man's land in our culture between the thought world and the physical world and again one of the few one of the takeaways I take out of Jung's autobiography is that is that Jung you know very much wondered about this stuff his his interest in you know that the really interesting passage of the out of that book that continues to so again so here's my here's my office that there's a there's an element of Jung's book that continues to haunt me his his reporting of his interactions with Freud and him and Jung predicting the report from the cabinet what I mean the report report is like a rifle report the it's just I'll have to pull up that book again and pull that section out because Peterson Peterson in a sense and this is where we get back to the miraculous Peterson in a sense was offering people a way out of the cycle of medicalized depression with is it a home remedy because home remedies can sometimes have this miraculous feel I I never went on the Jordan Peterson diet but I put my dog on it what does that mean I have a little dog and the little dog has endless allergies and skin problems autoimmune issues we every time we would take the dog to the vet you know it would cost three four five six hundred dollars they would give us all these medications we would give all these medications to the dog the dog is notoriously difficult to handle it's a little dog I used to have Rottweilers who never bit anybody this dog has this dog tries to bite everyone it was a rescue dog dog was likely abused in the first household it was in dog has unending skin problems dog has eye problems recently had one of the one of the dogs eyes removed so now he's walking around like this and he's white so you know a lot of people say you look like the dog and the bigger the beard gets the more I look like the dog but my wife at some point being an internet doctor she really isn't but you know we're spending hundreds of we're spending thousands of dollars on this dog for the skin problems and nothing seems to work and so we basically put the dog on the Peterson diet didn't get it from Peterson my wife just found on the internet you know just just give the dog beef just beef and you know what the dog the dog's skin problems went away now for a long time they've sort of come back now and you know it's back and forth and back and forth and back and forth but that that all beef diet that the dog was on cleared up that dog skin problems and whereas you know I was you know because I was buying this hypoallergenic dog food and giving the dog all these drugs you know beef costs a little bit more but you know you buy the you buy the cheapest ground beef you can and you feed it to the dog the dog loves it he lost a whole bunch of extra weight that he had and dog was doing great my wife insisted on you know taking these vitamin supplements and pouring it in remember when Joe Rogan asked Jordan Peterson about his his his cholesterol levels and about you know aren't you taking vitamins yada yada yada Peterson beef salt and water and we all listened to that and thought oh well that's strange and then Jordan is talking about well it's you know look at it cleared up my gingivitis fixed my mood disorders I could get up in the morning I got off the I got off the the depression meds and voila and and of course it fixed his daughter's things too and so well Michaela Peterson Jordan Peterson and my dog's skin problems all with just beef it's it has a miraculous nature and again no one's going to argue that we have bent the laws of of physics in this but but we sure are stressing the laws of the science of of what human beings should eat and and so all of this stuff gave sort of a mystique and a lure around Peterson and and so you know David's point here about well the crash sort of sort of undermines his savior status given his background in in Jungian therapy giving his background in kind of story I don't think that even he really can be thinking there's no deeper meaning that then it was just a an allergic reaction to this and then obviously had the illness of his wife but then it was it was just a series of medical events which is what Michaela jumped in to say no no it was definitely all of this it was just we've got the bad bad and so David's point here is correct I mean we're one of the things we're always trying to do is is have our world become whole and of course the the manifest image the scientific image we want to see through both eyes and and so and so I think David here and David of course talks to a lot of people and more importantly listens to a lot of people we always say talks to a lot of people but you really don't necessarily learn by talking to a lot of people you learn by listening to a lot of people and David David is a good listener and again David is one of the people I have followed through this I haven't seen anywhere near as much as of Tim Lott obviously hasn't been as visible as David in the space but but David is one of the people in this space that I that have a great deal of respect for because I see him as constantly checking himself and constantly looking for balance and and really trying to okay let's find our way through this and let's be fair and let's be let's be humble and let's suss out what we can and again even even David's entire channel is really about listening and and actually to be to get through life I would you know you have two ears in one mouth be quick to listen slow to speak as the Bible says advice from the doctors etc like that there is more to that there is more to that arc there is more to that incredible strain that he was under and then the the effect that it had on him that I I would love to hear my suspicion is that he's not at that point yet where he can really reflect on that and I would I would love to hear his reflection on that that that arc what happened over the period of two years and I just and this isn't David sorry I just chip in for a second yeah I was just gonna say this has always been a paradox with him you know for the very first time I met him he was I mean the point is and this is why okay and originally I was gonna start the video at this point but I really had to get a better sense on what Tim Lott feels this has always been a paradox with him well what's Tim Lott talking about he's talking about what David was just talking about that Peterson has always had this heaven and earth paradox with him and and it was sort of the the the miracle cure of depression and the anti-immune systems through the most through an extremely ascetic diet now why do I call it an ascetic diet almost becoming a a monk in this way and and again the miraculous is well nobody's accusing Peterson of breaking laws of physics but he is in some ways breaking the laws of the nutritionist and he is some ways breaking the laws of conventional wisdom and and he is doing this in a way that all of us look at because he's gotten big you know it's difficult to judge because unless he's lying and one finds it hard to believe he's lying this is how Michaela was cured after a great deal of grief and suffering okay there's the miracle aspect this is how Michaela was cured after a great deal of grief and suffering subsequently it cured him of depression so so physician heal yourself well it has so so now you know maybe Jordan Peterson isn't the Messiah but Jordan Peterson is at least has a handle on some things has some we can put it in Gnostic terms has some higher knowledge Jordan Peterson has a capacity now and this is to to heal himself and his daughter is healed and there's a huge number of people around him behind him that are evidencing themselves as the miracle cure there are also going to be others that then you know once he's framed in this way we'll charge him as a snake oil salesman so this is this is the area of of human interaction we're dealing with and it's it's the religious language in the religious area is sort of the best way to frame it now that doesn't mean that what he's subsequently used as a as a strategy was a sensible one but in the first two instances you know I'm quite inclined to believe that it was true but this time it seems to be too too bizarre to believe I suppose okay what's too bizarre to believe to too bizarre to believe that the we can just now chalk this up to medical says hey wait a minute I thought we the medical I thought the the lion diet of of of ground beef and salt and water this could fix your gingivitis and this could fix your autoimmune issues and this could fix your depression and so well now we're getting into time and again to I have to be careful with this analogy because I'm not pushing it too far and please don't push me too far on this but you know the words to Jesus on the cross you know if you're the Messiah come down from the cross Jordan if you're the Messiah you should be able to handle this well Jordan isn't the Messiah Jordan is a man but that that resonance is is there between the two now of course Jesus rises from the dead and the story goes so you know a lot of people including myself and and David you know are sort of waiting and and again Jordan doesn't owe this to us and Jordan says again and again and again I'm a private person but Jordan also tends to be a transparent person a person who speaks once Jordan if Jordan gets out there and does another book tour like he did before and you listen to what he says it's gonna come out you know that's that's that's he's gonna he's gonna reflect on and he's probably gonna reflect on it in public and he's probably gonna reflect on it in person and you know there we're all gonna be looking at it and dissecting it too yeah there's one thing I'd like to pick up on there because and this is this is a question I think that I would love to ask and I think it's a question that needs to be asked because he he did talk about the all meat diet and how it got him off antidepressants and for a long time he was asked the question are you on antidepressants and he and he said many times now I've come off the antidepressants but throughout all of that time he was on benzodiazepines and I think that is not entirely truthful it's at least a sin of omission because as far as I'm concerned benzodiazepines which are for anxiety they're definitely like very strong mood-altering drugs if you're on those for that entire period and I I think it's true to say that we now know that he was on those during the Kathy Newman interview he was on those from I think 2016 onwards that for me like the distinction between antidepressants and benzodiazepines to manage anxiety and to manage mood is kind of a distinction without a difference but he went out of his way to kind of try and claim that or not to Ryan claim but to make clear that he was off the antidepressants and I think so obviously well always tell the truth or at least don't lie well were you really telling the truth the meat alone will will the diet alone will will be the wonder drug well it wasn't the diet alone you were you were on now again drugs usually take you up or they take you down the SSRIs are supposed to take you up a bit the the benzos the anti-anxiety is supposed to settle you down so you know there's questions about that but but David David makes a fair point here I think that is given his given his focus on truth that for me is a little like it's something it's a question I think needs up to be answered and another question that is an open question I don't know know what I think about this is does does the arc of the last couple of years call into question his philosophy and I I can see the argument okay well he himself is not a mazai he doesn't claim to save anyone in a way that we say Jesus saves people he offers wisdom and wisdom might be okay the diet but he never really offered the diet as a central thing I mean Jordan's Jordan's central thing is meaning and the the Times piece again and I think both lot and David especially lot Tim Lott is is I think incredibly insightful and critical of his industry in this because again the reporter wanted to represent this Peterson as he was advocating manliness no that's that's not at all he was he's advocating meaning and I talked about this in the video on on Babylon and the fiery furnace and Peterson he's offering meaning as and and then the question is well hey Jordan wait a minute you were in the midst of a you were in the midst of a world-saving meaningful tour and you got taken down by this so so maybe it's not the meat diet maybe it's not cleaning your room but one one is hard pressed to believe a more meaningful tour than you were on you've got you've got men and women standing in line what is the number that he gives in terms of how many people he he spoke in front of you know a quarter of a million people in the span of a hundred and fifty days something like that millions of views on YouTube people coming up and bearing witness to the fact that he's really helped them I mean how much more meaningful a status rocket ride can you find and you still get taken down by the medical and by your wife's medical emergency and by your struggle with depression and by all of these things you still got took in debt taken down and so you know this the core of what Jordan is selling which again if you listen to the recorded conversation with the Times at the end of Jordan's time to talk he's he's right there making the point this is the message I want you to get out that it's meaning so so this is the this is the summary that Jordan Jordan gives and and again this is this is the core of of what he's offering I have one other one question for you too I think of all the things I think it would be a mistake to tilt this discussion too much towards the details of my illness because the story the hasn't been told properly is the reason for the tremendous hunger that's manifested itself for the sorts of things that I've been talking about and there isn't the journalist who's got that right yet and I think that's because journalists tend to look at things from a political perspective and this hasn't been a fundamentally political what I've been doing hasn't been fundamentally even though it's been cast that way you know I've been trying to help people I've been trying to point out to people that they need a profound meaning in their life because their lives are difficult and and without a sustaining meaning then you can become bitter and that's a bad outcome and also that the meaning that you need to sustain yourself is to be found through responsibility and that's the fundamental that's the fundamental message that's resounded with people it's that small equation meaning justifies suffering and meaning is to be found through responsibility and no one no one is no one is delivering that message but it's it's it's not optional that knowledge it's vital people can live without knowing that and so that's what I've been telling people is that look your life is going to be hard and that can warp and and and hurt you in a way that will incline you to make things worse rather than better but you can forestall that without being naive by taking on the proper responsibility in your life for yourself and for your community and that's real that makes things better it's not just a psychological paper over it's the genuine article and then I have all these thousands of people who are continually communicating with me who say I've tried that I tried that I was desperate and I tried that and it works so that shouldn't be lost in the shuffle and and in the details of my you know bizarre affliction it's a sideshow okay he says it's a sideshow but as David Fuller says no it's the real show now of course the Times I watch my video my watch my video about idols and and fiery furnaces I mean I I like Tom lot like Tim lot like David Fuller I was furious when I heard that transcript at what they had done and and Tim Lott is is you know what what what the press deserve what that newspaper and that reporter deserve for what they've done yeah they deserve all this fury because it's you know it's reprehensible what they did but David's point here okay responsibility and and again one of the things that comes through with Peterson's conversation with the reporter is that she again and again and again again tries to trigger him with did that make you angry did that make you angry and and that's just that that's just a that's just a Kafka trap that that she's trying to put Peterson into because if it says yeah it made me angry then aha people are supposed to be Zen and not angry or aha it didn't make you angry oh people are supposed to be It's one of these many Kafka traps we have currently in our moral imaginary in the culture but but the main point here is again physician heal yourself Jordan people face hard things in the world and again now Jordan could come back and say ah but I've not been embittered by it and fair enough but you were disabled by it and so all of these elements are part of this story and I think that's what's raising the dissonance deep down and we're we're again we're trying to put words to it well why why am I why do I experience dissonance with with Jordan's time on the cross how can how can this how can this be now I'm not advocating some sort of a quick easy closure of this because again as a pastor one of the things that you learn is that don't don't be codependent with people suffering if even if you can just wait in and fix something it's probably not the right thing to do for Christianity suffering is not at the bottom of the hierarchy suffering is not hell suffering can be hellish but suffering also can be productive so don't waste your sorrows don't waste your sufferings and and all of what we're through here is for Jordan and for us you know part of a process through which we can learn so but but David's point here is an important point that you can hear from his critics and again just because a critic makes a point about Peterson that's true doesn't mean it should be discounted because the person is a critic I mean that's part of the the facile cancel culture that we have oh Martin Luther was wrong about everything because it was an anti-semite okay oh dr. King was wrong about everything because he had a woman problem okay oh JFK you know on and on and on and on and on I think as an adult we can we can do a little bit of separating the people from the ideas and and sometimes understand that people are people and again I'm a Calvinist total depravity none of us are where we should be but but again David's point here is important and I think I think well stated by him and Tim Latt meant that it does and I can see the argument that it doesn't but I think for me it certainly shows up and I thought this about Jordan for quite a long time I think Jordan's philosophy is necessary but not sufficient and this focus on the individual is necessary but not sufficient and I think that's exactly right okay so this even the focus on focus on his philosophy what what's his philosophy just said it's personal responsibility it's necessary but not sufficient focus on the individual it's necessary but not sufficient and I think that the arc that we've seen shows up some of that insufficiency and I and I think it's a very open question as to whether and like I say I haven't got a I haven't got a firm view on that but I think it's a question worth exploring as to what what the the story of the last few years what that means for his his whole philosophy I mean I think there were tragedy here is it after a tremendous amount of media coverage most people won't have a clue what his philosophy is you know I mean and even after the interview Jordan and his end says to the reporter look and now we've read because Jordan posted it on his blog now we've read what they promised him in terms of an interview okay and Tim Lott is very clear about well there's some ways that Jordan could have gotten you know maybe have done a question and answer instead of just letting the reporter reframe it but here at the end of the interview Jordan in a sense says let me make this easy for you let me tell you exactly what I think my mission has been and what all of this has been about and why I've had the status rocket ride and and what is the deep need of our current moment let me tell you what that is let me put that into simple sentences that all of you can take and here it is right over her head over her head or willfully blind or why it's been so mischaracterized so misrepresent misrepresented so trivialized that the depth and breadth of it which anybody who's watched his early videos or read the maps of meaning should not be easy but to read and I still haven't finished it but you know that he's an unremarkable mind I like this guy's an honest guy you know that's maps of meaning yeah that's a hard book to read I haven't finished it neither have I I know some people out there how can you talk about Peterson not read maps of meaning well I've read I've read some of it I've read parts of it but yeah I read a lot of books but you would not think so if you were you just think what would you think I mean you would just think she was it's sort of table thumping all right bogeyman and he's nothing like that you know and and he's got a very very very interesting understanding of the way the world is and the way people are and I think it's a great tragedy that there aren't more writers who have taken the trouble to just simply without you know without getting into the whole red herrings and straw men of his supposed he's supposed in the sojourney his supposed transphobia which is entirely inaccurate as far as I can make out and have a think about what he's saying you know anything when you get into what he's saying it's it's very profound and very important and that's why he's got 25 million people looking at his videos because they're watching his videos they're not reading the newspapers and they and that's why the people who are reporting on him don't understand because they're not looking at his videos and not watching his lectures they're just reading other newspapers deciding who he is and going in there with both fists flailing and there's this huge gap between a busy journalist who just has to knock out another feature every week and you and I who will sit there and think this bloke looks interesting and you know as in my case about three years ago before he was became famous watched pretty much everything he'd ever recorded and you know and was gripped and fascinated and compelled by what he had to say and I simply didn't think of it and still don't in any in any political way it's almost as if our political mentality has become reduced to tram lines and with that we're impossible to mix my metaphors that we can't we can't think outside you know and and he doesn't sit anywhere in a simple spectrum of political thought and people don't seem to be able to cope with that or they can't be bothered to check him out properly because they're almost frightened that he might be right and and I think that's where what if he is right well I've got my you know I work in I work in religion I work in you know in fact the fear that someone might change their worldview is so foundational that areas of the Islamic world you know you can be in a great deal of trouble if you decide to break from your religious pact so yeah in religion we know all this and we know about willful blindness and we know about not wanting to look in certain areas and and and we know and but Tim has a dead-on point here and then and then of course that is gonna cause them problems and they're gonna have to start rethinking their whole worldview and nobody wants to do that God knows I mean I do but most people don't you know and and it's a pity it's a terrible pity so there it is my last video it was an hour and 14 minutes and Dan says he says that probably said at the beginning of there I want this to be a short video it's like our 14 minutes short I expected this to be a short video too obviously it isn't but again for me why am I making these videos I I make them to think I make them to think out loud I make them to try and understand and it's often the case that I get to the end of the video and I'm sort of in a different place that the video what turns out to be something quite other than I intended it now if I were a good video maker I'd go back and redo the front part of the video when I thought the video was going to be different but I'm not a good video maker this is this is a tool for me but the point here you know the various points that there's the magic element well Jordan Peterson seemed to seem to be performing a miracle that got all of our attention miracles always get our attention okay well what is this miracle about well what is at the heart of his message at the heart of his message is responsibility and well what does what does his journey into the wilderness say about the truth of his message and and I think David's point here necessary but not sufficient is right I think that's right now of course I have views beyond that and those of you who listen to my channel have heard him plenty and you'll hear him some more but I think that that's the takeaway here that's that's it's Jordan and the media but but the real question is okay Jordan is why do we watch each other go back to the first the first episode of the biblical series why do we watch each other and why do we take what we watch each other and we put it into words and we summarize it we we put it back and forth and you know I think David Fuller is right that at some point we want to have Jordan do this to himself and and yeah and we sort of wait for that but I think I think these are the issues so I was looking over at the at this at the end of a video youtubers are supposed to say like and subscribe and hit the notification bell and I usually don't like saying those kinds of things because I don't know it just sounds too mercenary and I really do think that my channel is is sort of self-indulgent because I am thinking out loud and I am trying to figure this out and I just find it helpful to to not do it alone in my office I find it this is why I started a blog this is why I I read the comment section because when I put my ideas out there sometimes they're bad ideas and you all swat them down it's it's it's painful to have your ideas swatted down but it's as Jordan says it's it's less painful than having you swatted down we have our ideas die for us okay so one of the things that I noticed is that and and we got this in a Friday morning question and answer stream that somebody in the con in the section told everybody go ahead and like the video because if you like it more people will watch and it's true gaming the algorithm so if you want more people to watch this video click that like button if you think the video is crap hit the thumbs down button or if you think the video is crap you're probably not watching at this point so there's another level of gaming the algorithm that I've just thought of so here it is here we are yeah let me know what you think in the comment section
