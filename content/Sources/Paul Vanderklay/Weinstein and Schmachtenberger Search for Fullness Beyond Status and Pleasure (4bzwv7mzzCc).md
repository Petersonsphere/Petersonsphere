 Hi, this is Paul. Oh, yeah, we got this on I got They're not going to a bank people gonna think I'm robbing it but get the get the Brett Weinstein bandana thing going and the raining in Sacramento had and walking to work in the rain because Well, the homeless people already know I'm here. So it's the way it goes, but I want to do a little bit more commentary on on this podcast with Eric Weinstein and Daniel Smokton burger Really interesting podcast talk about plan B on avoiding apocalypses now again as Apocalypse is basically the English translation for well, it's kind of the Greek English translation is really revelation. There's a lot of revelation going on in this or maybe a lack of revelation you can decide What I appreciate about this is perhaps it's it's It's Calvinism beneath the surface that humanity has painted itself into a corner and There is no one to blame but us and if you look at Eric Weinstein's menu tree That he talked about in the last one Yeah, there's there's all of these options leaving and they all seem to lead to death I was trying to catch up on a little bit of Better Call Saul. I'm still in the Netflix phase in the last season on Netflix and Yeah, Netflix is sort of the canons of Dohert of television or not Netflix but Better Call Saul is sort of the canons of Dohert of television because you look at You look at you know slipping Jimmy and he just can't he can't stay away No matter how many breaks he gets to and opportunities to fly, right? So I just love the way the character is developed amongst all the other characters and maybe I'll do a video on Better Call Saul at some point Breaking Bad was excellent, too We are a suicidal species This gets pulled out in the The Matrix movie Agent Smith makes that observation in Terminator 2 The Terminator makes that observation about us. We are a suicidal species Yet the the Weinstein brothers Weinstein world saving continues and they want to save the world for us in spite of us, it's it's very unlike anti-natalism and there's there's something very heroic about this and It's it's it's virtually messianic Karen made a comment that you know, she just gets it's always bothered listening to Eric because he always sounds like Well, the world would be fine if we just listened to him I said, yeah, but that's that's sort of like eating in a diner in New Jersey You know if you love the food and you just have to accept that the grease that comes with it it's just it's just part of the package with Eric and so Brett of course And I've talked about this many times over the past few years Brett of course with his description of the assassin robot and this insane spelling bee and this has come out and I've only watched the first of his he and his wife's Conversations about the coronavirus. I thought it was an excellent video But you know this insane DNA spelling bee where we're spelling I love to Thought about doing a video on that one how you know DNA is trying to get itself into the future Just it's just you know, it's just rife with all of the conversations that we've been having but then of course, well The assassin robots have to reprogram themselves to not be assassin robots Well, how could an assassin robot do that? Then you have the problem of who is we? Well, we have we can just transcend our programming really the assassin robot can transcend its programming What if the assassin robot doesn't really have much of a clue about what the assassin robot is doing because it's just an assassin robot And so how can the species be saved from itself? So Smokton burger at least sees that it's not so much a hardware problem as a software problem And I think that's an improvement And we see that this is fundamentally as I pointed out in the last video. This is fundamentally a religious conversation now the really poor definition of religion as to that which has to deal with supernatural things is sort of what's limiting the Observation among the people that you know, they're participating in a conversation that's been going on for thousands of years Philosophy yes, but but very much religious Now the terms of secularism are that we must exclude any conversation partner partner who isn't an assassin robot Well that kind of makes it difficult to figure out how we can transcend our assassin robot Programming unless well in the Heideberg catechism weighs in and says you need someone who is fully human and fully divine I couldn't help but think about that as I was thinking about the dilemma that they're having in secularism of well We have to transcend our assassin robot programming But only assassin robots can wade in to how this programming can be transcended and I got a hat trick to to Patrick Wagner who is a regular commenter on the channel who stuck in a Chesterton quote he often sticks in Chesterton quotes, but this one really grabbed me So so you get a grade a on colonizing Paul Vanderkley this week Because I said well, where's that from and he said heretics and I've got heretics on my hard drive And I've got it in my audible collection So let's pull out some more heretics and and listen to them by good old GK Chesterton And see my low status has its advantage so be careful about wishing it away all you folks who think that someday I'll have a million subscribers Chesterton oh shoot. I didn't even do the commenting on the First we got it first. We got to play the video and then we can read Chesterton See where our strange kinds of assassin robots that that aren't really too tuned into ourselves So let's let's jump in let's jump in here as some time Here are the things that really disturbed me about it one You don't have to grimace. I mean, I want to not grimacing. I'm smiling. Okay One is the the love what is the minimal level of violence and coercion? Needed to bring about some of these changes so this was something that I brought up in my discussion with Peter teal and his in my sort of Somewhat mutual framework really I learned something from him, but I tried to put my own thing back into it is Take take a beautiful dream Ask what the minimal level of violence and coercion needed to accomplish it Add that in as part of the cost and ask yourself. Is it still beautiful? So that's one of the questions that I would ask you And it's really good question and Then I get to the issue of certain things like lakefront property in the atomic world anyway are Valuable and unique and it becomes problematic to imagine a world in which all of our previous experience was about competing for these things and and this is where we get to really the nub of smockton burgers desire to You know we have to do is get rid of rivalry and and you know so eventually he'll mention Buddhism because of course Well, if we can get rid of desire We can get rid of rivalry because we won't desire but at some point you then have to ask Well is life worth living without desire so we can have we can have the necessary amount of desire without it Triggering our assassin robot programming to to go ahead and do bad things to each other to imagine a hundred percent Adherence to this new way of thinking Well, let's go protopia not utopian. Let's go that there are some say what you mean by protopia moving in the right direction All right. I guys are always making up new words, but go ahead Let's say that there are some things that are Harder to make adequately abundant than other things But there's a lot of low-hanging fruit that we can start moving and as we do it We will get that there's good reason to think that there is a basis to do that in more areas Now what strikes me when I when I hear him say this is there's this great passage at the beginning of CS Lewis's the the great divorce where Someone on the bus one of the one of the sad One of the one of the sad miserable ornery characters on the bus Gets up to the other world and wants to take something back with them into the old world because they figure that hell can be reformed if there's only scarcity and what you need is scarcity for the Economy to get going and then hell can be transformed and what's interesting is Is now it now you see sort of the opposite and that well if rivalry is the problem Well, why don't we you know, it's it's basically a parents It's basically the parental strategy of well if the kids are all fighting over the last ice cream cone Make sure that you always have enough ice cream cones for everyone and in many ways This is sort of what this is the affluence model and this is the affluence answer and if we can make if we can have Make everyone affluent then they'll be more peaceable and there's a certain amount of Truth about this Peterson of course mentioned that you know, it's not necessarily income inequality that make people Violent it's the it's the delta between the people and how close they are to each other if you have a great deal of income Inequality and they're right next door to each other. That's when you have problems But if everybody's sort of poor and in it together everybody's sort of rich and in it together Well, then you've got a little bit less rivalry and so Now it's it's helpful here to note that all of these This is going to become a theme in this in this in this video that all of these answers work pretty well They they they they're they're moderately scalable. They'll They'll they'll maybe get rid of you know, maybe they get rid of 80% of your problem But the last 20% is is critical But the last 20% is often the thing that will do you in so You know, so this is the the affluent the affluent way around the mass production way around rivalry that if you know if if everybody is is angry for ice cream cones then well Make sure that there are enough ice cream cones and and then and then everybody will be happy So in a system where when something is more scarce it is worth more Than if I'm on the supply side of that I have an incentive to manufacture artificial scarcity and To definitely prevent abundance that would debase the value of the thing that I have So in other words, don't let Apple make an iPod and have all those You know really cool white earbuds and have bono and although, you know All the all the because because basically Apple's whole business model is to I'm gonna get my trouble Why am I waiting into the Apple Windows or Apple Android thing? you know the whole the whole point of desirability is The more you pay the more it's worth in a world where we remove the association of value and Scarcity then where there are actual scarcities the goal is to engineer the scarcity out of the system Mm-hmm And so if we're talking about limited amount of oceanfront then this is where we say well Can we do sea-steadying and create a lot of oceanfront? That is really awesome where there is actually more to there's like more people are shopping at the store than we need more shopping carts And so part of the answer is how do we actually increase the abundance but not in? Exponential abundance because we're talking about also steady-state population and using and a lot of shared resources We Should however pause and remember the fact that a lot of these apocalyptic nightmares have been the result of actually using this strategy to get us out of class warfare that if we can just make Africa and Asia middle class then the world will be nice But of course you have the problem that eight billion people can't all live like 200 300 million Americans are living now and you can't have one car per person And and you can't have all of these things that we're used to eating and we can't all drink all this milk and have all this Beef and so on and all eat meat and so on and so on and this is an old argument I remember back in the 70s rich Christians in an age of hunger was Ron Siders wrote this book that you know really turns later my little corner of Christianity on its head and you know everybody stopped eating meat and you know, that's why when I watch all of this stuff happen today It's like yeah, yeah, nothing, you know, there's nothing new under the Sun. I've seen this all the 70s You know getting back 50 years ago. I watched all this I watched all this in the 70s I'm an old man get off my lawn, but that's so so the engineering scarcity Well, we're gonna have to scale up and get rid of scarcity. So then people won't people won't you know start to envy each other and hate each other and on and on and on and It's that coupled with psychologically healthier more mature people that relate to these things differently both of them and and and what what really So Part of part of what I chuckle about when I listen to this is because if you've been part of a church environment many of these problems have been abundantly clear for much of your lifetime Well, if only we had mature if only we had mature responsible better people then well Yeah But isn't that the product of what your system is supposed to produce if only people were better than they wouldn't be Assassin robots, but we're assassin robots so or we're only acting like we're not assassin robots because we have plenty unless and until Something happens and then the knives come out and the you know, the teeth come out and and and off we go so, you know, and it's it's so funny because You see this in churches because what you'll have in a church in a small community like a church that you know, especially in an urban area where maybe not everybody is is Married to each other and not everyone is a blood relative to each other in rural communities You'll tend to have churches where those dynamics especially in a church like the Christian reformed church with all of these immigrants where that tends to be true but you've always got out some of these people over here who are more mature and more reasonable and and These are these are sort of the ideal people then you've got these other people who are not acting ideally Well, if only these other people would act I if only these other people would be like them Okay. Well, how are we gonna make me make them like them? Well, we'll talk at them once a week Okay, we'll talk at him once a week. Well that fix it. Well, not really well We'll have small groups and then there'll be life on life and that'll help or then we'll hire a counselor and the counselor will Will do a whole lot more listening to them and maybe talk them into being mature people and you know Again all of these things sort of what do help a bit but in the end we've still got a hierarchy and It's that it's that hierarchy that not just of goods that can be manufactured but it's the hierarchy of Human beings But that causes a lot of this stuff. Those are necessary. Neither would be sufficient on their own Well, I like that a lot and I I do quite honestly take some hope in that I'm finding that what people are now rivalrous about has changed a lot I think over the course of my life That's because we've gotten a lot more affluent and if anybody's as the stories are about to show Eric Weinstein is is is living in a very affluent Among a very affluent group of people now far more affluent than me or just about everybody else listening to this podcast I Think Millennials are much more Interested in what what experiences have you had recently rather than what have you bought and purchased recently? That's because there's been a hierarchy and everybody has the same thing And so everybody has an iPhone and everybody has nice clothes and everybody has this and everybody has that so so so now it's it's all about experiences In part because the economy kind of turned against them, but travel got cheap right and so They still have a lot of stuff a lot of them, but again, we've got hierarchies here and inequalities That's been interesting to see do you believe? That we have a huge nearly universal level up in maturity and wisdom available to us through development hacking And as opposed to church or counseling or Education or you see the truth is we've been Mumping about at this for a very long time So it is Both how we develop that socially which I don't think will happen uniformly I think will happen in pockets that become strange attractors That other groups will want to then implement once seen and now you know both of these guys I think have a pretty good handle on a fair amount of of of Human nature as I'll call it now again I'm a Calvinist and I'm talking and I'm a Christian and talking about a sinful human nature, but Yeah That's a really optimistic perspective Perspective especially At a time when well suddenly, you know, the economy's crashing and we're heading towards a economic Slow down the likes of which We've not seen in 100 years at least as they're so clearly better at both quality of life and innovation And How long that takes to develop widely is a while like this is a multi-generation thing, okay I Think that that would not be sufficient on its own, but it's necessary Better sense-making systems where we can actually solve problems without causing worse problems Which we're not historically good at is also necessary And and and there's a there's a certain amount of captain obviousness in some of these things like like we need to do better Because we really need to do better. So so better let's agree that better is better than less better and This is both some Evolution in our epistemic sand our actual processes of collective sense-making and collective coordination We Certainly have added fancy words to this whole thing so yes, I see level ups in both of those possible Now I'm gonna ask a very difficult question But we have to get to it. Yeah in essence I've got a riff which I don't think I've said publicly which is that the biggest problem With discussing sexuality is is that sex sex is sexy Yeah, and if you have something that's central to the world that is almost impossible to talk about yeah It's a very strange state of affairs Assume that we solve all of these problems that don't have to do with status sex and reproduction According to your most optimistic scenario, but we have trouble over here that there's one last little pesky problem Yeah, I just read an article this morning saying Yeah, domestic violence is gonna is shooting way up during this pandemic you think Dr. John Campbell also postulated that We're at nine months from now. We're gonna see a lot of babies born Well, maybe not as many babies as a hundred years ago after everyone was sheltering at home, but still more Does this situation work? Yes Now I will speak to it because as you said it is central and am I wrong about that it is central And I think Eric but you know put his finger on it and and that's I think this last half hour of the whole conversation is is Is really outstanding, of course, okay But my speaking to it is probably gonna change the comment section of This video but so be it. You know what if they don't want to come along for the ride they I Think that the most important thing is to just try to do this Mean to say this to be horrible, but let's try to take some of the stupid fun out of discussing sexuality by talking about it for what it is and a central system that Has to be discussed because it is the engine of human behavior That is such an interesting comment is you mean that in a Freudian way? You mean that in a evolutionary way and and because well Well, if you mean it in in a in a reductionistic way Sex is a big deal sex is a really big deal. We all got here because of it So your brother and I had this conversation when we Met and obviously with his background evolutionary biology and primate mating and whatever I was very interested in his perspective and it but by the way, and I've been reading a lot of Chesterton lately so you'll have to forgive me but Perpetually Looking to Apes to gain insight into human sexuality is itself a remarkable move I just had to say that took a little while but for what it's worth and let me just jump in one second Brett were he here? Yeah would break the theory of selection Into two pieces there would be the stuff that follows natural Selection the way we expect it from Darwin and then he would break it into a second piece Which is the stuff that goes completely counterintuitive due to? Sexual selection right and That division is actually part of the standard evolutionary Toolkit he does it a little bit better and a little bit differently right, but that division into natural and sexual selection is part of the territory and it really matters for when we think about resource scarcity because The resources that people need to deal with the first part the survival part are not that much right actually But the resources that people need to deal with the mating part is more than the other guy Historically, which is why the guy with the hundred and fifty foot yacht might feel bad when the 200 foot yacht Well, this is up. Okay before we get to that and this is the part that's coming it's really the part that I'm I would I really caught my attention, but You know if you go back to my Patriarch same-sex marriage video that I did last week, you know a lot of these a lot of these Things get very interesting and Peterson I think Peterson was right to note that in human sexuality the story verse and the Let's say the animal nature in a sense really come together in a highway This is where they're gonna go because high-status men have more access better access high-status women on and on and on and on But again, if you remember the world of the patriarchs You just have to read the book of Samuel and and you very quickly get a sense of human beings why Women who produce sons were heroes of their tribe I mean, this is life and death stuff and barren women I love at the beginning of first Samuel where where Hannah is barren and there's Hannah and Panina Oh Bible knowledge test Elkanna has two wives Hannah and Panina and Panina has had sons and Hannah has none and and Her husband goes to her says isn't my love for you more than but you know greater than any than seven sons And she's like hell no Status is about sons and and that's why when you get to To Jacob and Leah and Rachel you have this whole derby about sons because Amongst the tribe the woman that could produce many sons She had status and the woman who was barren has no status and if you don't understand this status thing You can't understand You know many many of the most interesting narratives when they within the Old Testament because it's all about sons and the sons are are connected to to Flourishing and out competing your your your treat your rival wife or your rival tribe or your rival village or your rival nation and and the reason Egypt is a perpetual empire and a perpetual power is because they produce all of this food and all of that food goes to all of that population And on and on and on and on and everybody lives in fear of them, so it's a really big deal and We cooperate in order to compete that's Brett saying and it's I think it's a there's a lot of truth to that saying This is this is the yeah, it's the engine of human history, but and then now we're gonna get into this question of status and mating and sex and the guy who has the 200 foot yacht the guy who has the 300 foot yacht and and all these Billionaires who want to be president? Well, yeah, this is this is a big deal and let's say this Is close you're not an evolutionary theorist. I'm not but we can do our best there is a version of evolutionary theory which states that There needs to be Crisis There needs to be a function for showing that you are better in order to keep individuals And now we got one we see all these governors on TV and you know Who's doing the best as governor? Is it is it Cuomo in New York or or is it Newsom here in? California and what about that Michigan governor and with Biden, you know with Biden was looking at her and Biden already sort of limited half of the half of the potential, you know Limited his scope of potential VP candidates because all it's got to be a woman now he went and mentioned that and Well, you're looking around during the pandemic and you might have found one that the governor that's impressing the nation You might you might not be able to pick a rock star because you backed yourself into a corner. But anyway Max, you know sort of on that razor's edge of Performance and that mating opportunities means that there's always a crisis. There's never enough abundance because somebody with 13 homes is More desirable than somebody with nine homes if you're just trying to figure out if there were a crisis, right who would do better? right so we have to overcome that because that drives a Malthusian situation of no amount of resource ever bring sufficiency about right and Drives a fundamental rivalry, which is why you said we have to address it So what I'm My take on this is I explored it my process with myself Has been asking okay As soon as I saw that the dynamics of this world that seemed intuitive and natural to Most of us as we kind of grew up in it were conditioned by it We're self-terminating and I said any of the things that we think of as normal I'm willing to question that And so how do I think could I imagine a high-tech civilization that doesn't implode could I imagine a kind of Enlightened planet. What would life be like there all the different things Enlightened planet now again at some point you have to ask. Okay, you're you're we're using all these other words to sound rather Medical or Antiseptic or an in Lord an enlightened planet where we're what what what does that look like? I Mean you can throw the word out there, but can you draw me a picture? Well, maybe it looks like something I saw in a Star Trek movie or a Star Wars movie or you know, it's well It's where people aren't It doesn't look like a lot of what we have seen families look like and villages look like maybe that there are moments and and I love how John McWhorter talks about this and and and in many ways this conversation and sort of the woke conversation come together because John McWhorter talks about this and in that You know people have a lot of different ideas about what they're going to do John McWhorter talks about this and in that you know people have these coaches to Get them to get rid of all of their you know White people have these coaches to get rid of all of their racism and and John McWhorter is kind of like, okay Well, what does that look like? Really? What does that look like and you say well, it's it's us without racism Okay, and and rate because racism is pervasive. Okay, and now again, I'm a Calvinist I agree racism is pervasive and I agree with they I agree with a lot of the charges I'm just skeptical because What you're having a really hard time pointing to is the straight stick rather than the crooked stick is What life without all of this aggression would look like now Maybe you and and very quickly religious imagery comes in and and I'm amazed how often I see Is it Buddhist imagery is that Eastern imagery? I don't know how to describe it, but when you go into a hospital hospital Marketing materials are using like people You know Levitating in a lotus position or they're doing yoga just just pay attention how much imagery there's this is and and this gets Into the question of can we actually picture? The good and the ideal and it's really hard. I remember Peter Kreef talking about CS Lewis's Aslan character because It's really compelling drama to do better call Saul and Breaking Bad and the Sopranos it's very difficult apart from these glimpses To to really show the ideal and and so will you will throw out these words and I'm not I'm not you know Casting shade on other religions in this and because in fact there are there are portions of the Bible that that get Broad out, you know the lion lays down with the lamb and neither shall they harm on all my holy mountain and there are these Kelsey on days in the book of Acts when everybody shared what they had and and so You know these guys are barking up a very religious tree and in fact for the most part most of the stock images that we have are religious because if you just show I Don't know some rapper on a 300 foot Boat with You know again I mean it's amazing how often sex comes into this and and if you look at someone challenged in the comment section Talk that might have been Carl Talked about Islam and yeah, you know 40 virgins and I you know, I always thought that was kind of an interesting In my Calvinist days, you know in my in my days growing up in Christian school nobody ever said well, you know If you if you do the right thing then when you die you'll get limitless sex with And what's the deal about virgins in heaven? Anyway, so it just gets interesting. But again that the part of the reason so much contemporary marketing iconography looks religious says a lot about The dilemma that these true these two are really facing in this conversation and so to use a word like Enlightenment and it's not so much enlightenment as in I Don't know 17th and 18th century Guys from Christendom who are playing around with science It's not our image is less John Locke and more Buddha Isn't it when we use that word in this way? Conflict emotion resources and sexuality is obviously one of the big and so emmix of this world so we have to overcome that because that drives a Malthusian situation of no amount of resource ever bring sufficiency about right and Drives a fundamental rivalry, which is why you said we have to address it So what I'm My take on this is I explored it I could be a little dismissive and but but I do want to say here that to to do these Conversations to record them like this and share them This is all high wire stuff and both these guys are are super smart way smarter than I am and better wet red than I am And so on and so forth. So, you know, I'm not really taking anything away from them, but It's just pointing out what I observe as they do it and you know by no means You know and I have if I would use it the luxury of actually editing my words here is really hard stuff my process and Drives a fundamental rivalry, which is why you said we have to address it So what I'm My take on this is I explored it my process with myself has been asking. Okay As soon as I saw that the dynamics of this world that seemed intuitive and natural to Most of us as we kind of grew up in it were conditioned by it were self-terminating and I said any The dynamics of this world are self-terminating All of the it's so funny because we also have this other Major marketing trend if we want everything to be natural and it's like, yeah, that's the natural world that self that self terminating, right? That's self-terminating right? Again, this is another Jordan Peterson point that he makes. The things that we think of as normal I'm willing to question deeply Okay And so how do I think could I imagine a high-tech civilization that doesn't implode? Could I imagine a kind of enlightened planet? What would life be like there? All the different things Conflict emotion resources and sexuality is obviously one of the big questions Now it's very interesting that The imagining he's trying to do is active Now this is very different from if we look at and I've already said that you know, it's almost all religious Imagery and iconography and I use that word intentionally here that we use or emulate or mimic if we're trying to collectively Imagine this or image it together I would assert that most of that stuff had its origin in Well, first of all deeply religious context but also far less Intentionalized rationalized Context than than what we that what we're playing in right here and I Think in other in other words the dude goes up to a mountain and he comes down and here it is I had it when I was you know, this is why everybody's crazy about getting on getting on psychedelics because he get there quicker instead of you know being a monk in the desert I Think the book sex it wrong sex at dawn obviously gets plenty of things wrong. It's trying to make a strong antithesis I'm not sure what book that is. Maybe I should look it up sex and non is that I Tried googling it and I got a huge page for 12 step programs for sex addicts. So So if you know what book he's talking about leave it in the comments because I'm curious Thesis to the standard evolutionary history of homo sapiens thesis But I think there are some key parts to it when they look at the Moswap people or the canela people or people that did Not have and this is always another interesting thing to me that we we You know, so we got chimps and apes and we got all of this hierarchical status driven ape sexuality going and it's like oh but the bonobos and then we look at the 99% of human behavior and we beat the bushes and we find this tiny little tribe over here where They're doing sex differently and all look at them it's like and they're actually gonna dress this here because there's an objection in there that says yeah, but and And you could point that objection to saints and the church you've got all of these run-of-the-mill Christians who are just as miserable and Misery causing as anyone else. Oh, look at the saint. Look at Jesus. Look at you know, so fair enough That had a stable society that was not Primarily pair bonded but had had a tiny little stable society that wasn't predominantly pair bonded but You know multi-female dynamics. It's not to say that's how humans mostly were that doesn't matter It's to say that it's a possibility if it's within the possibility set same with buddhas Yeah possibility sense When you when you're when you're treading in that realm, there's a lot of possibilities There's a lot of possibilities so the question then is What are what is the imagined straight stick that we can't really describe? That is pointing you to that group of people what? Aspects of their community. Do you say they get this right and we get and and they got that wrong now Now again this sort of now we're talking selection bias Because if we say well You know Bill Gates is the way a human being should live their life, okay Or or Eric Weinstein is the way a human being should live their life or or Jordan Peterson is the way human being should live Their life or Paul van der Kley is the way if human beings should live their life. Okay, but Here's where you get the verve a key and relevance realization because it's okay, which ass what thing out of the near? Infinite number of things are you pointing to and then drawing your correlation? It's really hard combinatorial explosion I'm not saying that's how people know this is what I've been sort of It doesn't have to win. It just needs to establish proof of concept and then we can try to scale it up for yeah It's a positive deviant analysis for proof of concept to then say can we make that actual is that a viable model for a new center? that now again What about that model? Do you say that model is a lot better than this model now? Maybe it's because the this model is the one that you grew up in and you realized Dad and mom fought all the time and dad would step out and mom would keep her mouth shut or on and on and on and on and on that model over there where they had a What more sex better sex hotter sex? What what about that model? What what is the thing? That is going to well, okay. Well the context of the conversation anti rivalry Nobody gets upset about and well, you know, I brave new world I mean, that's exactly what brave new world was again. You you weren't allowed to say no and Then we'll talk about the United Community same thing. No sticky love But that that way no more rivalry about sex partners, okay Oh gosh because because because when I think about this I laugh because Just look at okay cupids Data there's this great little video out there that I've played in past videos and you can find it pretty easily I think it was on the Atlantic or New York Times or something like this and basically it was Yeah, women tended to want men that were kind of about their age, but the men were all like All the 20 year olds why there's a picture Men are dumb and and so well Yeah, it's very evolutionary. It's very it's very evolutionary that the men will line up for the 20 year olds and I'm not sure how Anti-rivalrous this is gonna be but anyway go on and is that a possible thing to make and And The fact that it didn't make it through evolution so far like evolution has a blind quality to it right where it'll make a adaptation that makes sense in the moment to set Determined by something there are so many Body jokes one could make at this moment and like warfare that is actually not good long term was even self terminating long term So the argument if it would have been a good system, it would have made it Well, the thing that has made it is continuing to up ratchet rival risk capacity Oh that itself is gonna self terminate metaclass hacking that somehow we've hacked ourselves into a position that we can keep surviving Yeah, and so one one version says that we can never escape the evolutionary imperatives The other says we will always we have always escaped whatever our last problem was And so we should be expected that even if there's only this sliver of hope we should exploit it to the fullest and I love these two guys because I mean they're able to You can see the problem, but they're able to put such good words on it say well there it is And and that's why it's a good conversation. It's back and forth back and forth The conversation is good because it's rival risk, but it's not rival risk in this stupid way Where it's just about ego and status. It's it's productive, but it's still rival risk and that's and that's just it that it's it's not abandoning all rivalry because actually And and Eric talks about this all the time and it's sort of the the subtle the subtle Most universal obvious thing about us is that well I'm not interested in that and so it's it's all interest that drives this stuff and the reason that this Conversation is interesting is because there's enough rivalry in it It's sort of like CS Lewis's second friend is the first friend is the person that you agree you agree with the person on everything And you're just enjoying the the community of agreement the second friend is the person that you Disagree with on just about everything, but they're rival risk enough But they're also not to ride their their rival risk enough in all the right ways and not so in all the wrong ways to actually make it interesting Yeah, and so generally this situation happens that we have a near-term incentive to pursue some advantage But where the disadvantage of that thing might happen over a much longer term and that's like one of the fundamental problems, right? The externality might show up over hundreds or thousands of years But the benefit and they talk about these externalities in this video and again, this is not really good stuff and I really grow and I learn from this stuff because it's the problem of the Commons where you know if I don't have to If I don't have to pay for I've got this great chemical process that makes the best Drano that you could imagine But a byproduct of of making this new super Drano is this really? Caustic chemical and if I actually have to process this chemical It's gonna make my new super Drano Prohibitively expensive compared to all the less costly Drano's and so I'm gonna dump it into the Passaic River and if you know the Passaic River you can see a lot of Commons externalities have been dumped into the Passaic River and it's it's really a shame because it's a beautiful little river that Don't ever eat any fish that comes out of that river and there at the bottom of the falls. There's all this foam and it's like And you we'd visit the falls as children and all the spray would come up on us and everything in the winter would be all Frozen and it'd be like this. But then when you get back in the car after visiting the falls would be like What's that smell? It's all the water It's because all the problem of the Commons everybody's dumping into it And so well, this is a problem that we have occurs over this year So I have to do it So we have to get over that actually if we're affecting the world in such fundamental ways over the long term We have to actually be factoring that into our decision-making now. That's one of the minimum Requirements of a game be if it's gonna exist Which also means of a viable civilization at all so Now again, it's interesting because well, what's our goal here? well, we want we want to save the world from us for us and We want it to be Everlasting and again when I listen to this, it's like I've I heard this before. Oh, yeah, I heard it from me I heard it from preaching. I heard it from the Bible. It's Eschatology it's what the church has been talking about and all of this well, we want just enough rivalry so that people actually do something, but we don't want too much rivalry and the job of a pastor I Gotta be careful what I say now because now I've got real people in mind The job of a pastor is to help people get along and to be better more mature people That's my whole job and it and it's and it's you know playing around with these really cool ideas But what's so funny is like I listen to these guys talk and it's like yeah I know everything that you're talking about because I've been in church my whole life And you've got all these fancy words and and one of the things that I really appreciate about about Eric Weinstein and one of my Constant complaints about Jordan Peterson was that Jordan Peterson, you know, it was all about the individual right, it's all about the individual and part of the reason I started making videos was because as a pastor I know that If people are going to grow they're going to If people are going to grow they're going to need I Listen to Jordan Peterson video and I'll psyched up about meaning and I'm ready to do my future offing program I'm gonna do this stuff. I'm gonna clean my room and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah Yeah And you need an institution around you to help you keep doing it to help scale this amongst other people to to deal with Well, I'm only gonna have an institution I'm only gonna have conversations with people who are mature and brilliant and insightful and articulate Oh the people at the top of the hierarchy hierarchy. What about the rest of the schmucks? What about the rest of the people who aren't that bright and aren't that mature and aren't that good and and Gosh, you get them all in church, you know, and it's like it's not a church I'd ever want to go to because look at all the people but that's the point of the institution and Weinstein talks about institutions is Conversation with I just have to scroll down a little bit with James O'Keefe a very interesting conversation and and and and Weinstein's complaint was you should focus more on institutions not in individuals and and so Weinstein gets Institutions and I really love that about him. But listening to these two talk it's like Yeah, you're talking about what has been happening in church for like 2,000 years And your goals are about the same Isn't that what's happening here When it comes to status because I think status and sexuality go largely together It's not exactly one for one, but and if you think churches don't run into sex problems Those are the only kinds of things that get in the news There's a strong correlation I was listening to you on a few podcasts and you were talking about e prime and talking about spinners and your kind of geometric unity And I was just fucking loving it and I was loving even the status of like you describing Theoretical physics and mathematics well, which are topics that you know so much better than I do but that I'm fascinated by and Educating the public about it and there was no like status competition Impulse in me that was like oh but wait he is being seen as smart for these things I was like, wow, this fucking awesome I hope that he gets more status doing that because it's obvious in other words he had a moment when it's the as CS Lewis call it the the specific The specific pleasure of the inferior when I recognize that You know if you're on a team with a whole bunch of other kids and maybe you're playing basketball And you've got one player who is head and shoulders your best player everybody else on the team They all want they all want you know, they all want time on the floor They all want to play but what they really want is to win again Now you're using rival risk things and so I want this person that can obviously Do this better than me I want him or her in the game so that our team can win in other words We cooperate in order to compete Honestly good for the world Geez, I have such different intuitions about this. I Mean, you know to be blunt about it I Didn't really talk about this stuff for ages and there was a part of me that cared about status But this was always a part in fact I really to the extent that I think that I have anything interesting in new It is a very uncomfortable feeling I mean I could show you all sorts of cool things on you know, if I came up with a new lick on the guitar I Would enjoy showing it to you. Mm-hmm. This is something I feel very I have felt very uncomfortable about and There are ways in which Well It's very apart for me from the status game I've been fascinated looking at some of the comments Where people say, you know so-and-so is in it for the grift and they just want money and this is an ego trip and I have to say the least fun part the reason I didn't do a podcast for a long time and the reason that I I Didn't commercialize this and I left a lot of money on the table and I'm intending to commercialize this Is that I was very uncomfortable with all of these issues. I didn't like it and I Think people imagine that their first few increments of status Are fun so that getting more and more status must be awesome. And I actually don't think that that's true I think it's a little bit like Wow, my first my first taste of heroin was pretty sweet. I should do this all the time It goes into some completely different place and and this is the part of the conversation that I thought was was really outstanding and I can't read the Family message chat and they can't and put my watch away But this this is the part of the conversation that was really good because Here we're recognizing Well, yeah status status status is and I'm guilty of this time I mean status is a really big deal status is an enormous deal And you know, it was a number of years ago that I began to recognize just how much of the New Testament deals in status and and how and And again Peugeot puts all of this in really interesting terms How Jesus comes and deals with this status stuff all the time? Read Philippians 2 is the ease the and read when he tells his disciples The greatest among you is the servant of all and he pulls a kid who's who's probably standing in the corner Waiting on tables of the disciples and says this is you know This is the greatest among you and the greatest among you is the servant of all I mean Jesus is constantly dealing with that status stuff, but but status here is and I love this idea that that they took That they come together and they're all in this together I love this idea that that they took that they come together, which is that? Just this In small dosages. It's like oh I should I should If I if my life could be all this, you know, think about Edmund and turkish delight and CS Lewis's line the witch in the wardrobe well Turkish delight 24 7 would soon become misery and and I think these two languages really well here so That is counter to the narrative that we're all seeking maximum status and in competition with each other for status well, I think yeah, I think that there is a That is a low resolution narrative, right? I think that You know, it's like it's make fun of the fact that Evolutionarily you're crazy for sugar and the fact that they give it away for free at starbucks You know There's some part of you that's a three-year three-year-old kid just wants to eat as many packets of sugar as you possibly can It's not going to be a good thing. Right? Yeah, keep going and and and you know, I think about that I played it once in one of my videos and youtube ripped that video down so fast louis ck talked about you know, we we fly through the air in these airplanes and you know, they're giving away sugar at you know if someone were to step out of The ancient world and look at our lives they would say What do you mean the kingdom of god you're living it here and now give it away sugar at starbucks for pete's sake Sorry about that. Well, so this is the thing I think I think it's actually true that there's a lot of status that is not really that fun. This is also my experience But I think it's also true that we can feel good about rather than bad about where someone else is doing socially well If if we yeah, I mean if we if we have a kind of love and trust And we have an idea Like, you know, i'm friends with andrew yang I disagree with a bunch of his policies But I have a feeling that he is a guy who's just earnest You know, I'm knowing knowing him socially. I have the sense that it is not an ego trip for him To want to steward the country. It's a you know, you're taking on a position that Puts you in a life and death situation with the number of attempts on president's lives. Let's say it's a it is an eco trip to very solemn responsibility and I think that in part We want people who we feel are grounded And by the way, i'm not always grounded, you know, so i've i've drunk my own status um you know to excess at times but It's a very tricky thing who do I want to have status who do I not want to have status do I trust I have A friend who is the nicest person in the world except when he's doing well and then he becomes very difficult to deal with You know, so they're like The there's the person who's fine on one glass of alcohol And you don't want them to have three. Yeah so I think status has a hyper normal stimuli where In a evolutionary environment, we couldn't necessarily have more than 150 people pay attention to us. Yeah And now we can have a huge number of people pay attention to us And and these kind of arguments are always fascinating. It's the And and they're in so again, basically what's this dunbar number or something that they'll talk about that here we can Basically, we're we're built I love the language. We're built to inhabit A a community of such and such a size and when the community what we've done now is scaled up way beyond what we've Normally been able to build by and so we have these little hacks to get up to these and now via social media now you know of a few thousand people can listen to me and that just sort of Jacks everything up and you know, it was jonathan bajot who had mentioned. Yeah on youtube. We're beings of light and we're probably You know Monkeying around with deep things in our head that have been been programmed in other ways. And so you know, we have these little internet youtube celebrities and On and on and on and this says status and so on and so forth. It's helpful to remember though that The whole project of this conversation is another hack and they've talked about this You know that what are going to be the downsides of the hack and we're not going to be able to do that What are going to be the downsides of the hack and we're not going to probably know the downsides of the hack for hundreds of years later because I was just reading an article from the smithsonian mag was talking about the impact of past pandemics and how You know one of the things that one of the things that Pandemics forced cities to do was well Let's no longer have horses defecating in the street and let's not let garbage pile up and let's not have people Empty chambered pots out the window. Let's have let's have sanitation So then you had sewers and all those sewers just led to the lake or to the river and then oh we shouldn't have that anymore So now we have a sewage treatment plant. I mean it says boom boom boom boom boom. Well We don't know You know, okay So we got rid of horses and we have internal combustion engine engines and now we face the fact that well internal combustion engines are Maybe adding to more greenhouse gases than horses would I don't know someone Some smart person out there would do the math and i've just triggered the the The co2 climate thing so, you know, you can cut and paste your comments now But you know there we are and have it metricized with likes or whatever. I think it is like sugar a hypernormal stimulus that Is very hard for it not to be bad for us and we actually have to have a very mature relationship to it And again back to okay. We have to have a mature relationship now. We're using this other word So and and it's the right word so that a mature relationship with sugar is I can have a little bit of sugar in my coffee But not too much sugar What do you mean by mature? Actually, what we're talking about is a limit on your desires In order to say no to myself about sugar In order to say no to drinking my own kool-aid about status in order to say no to Thinking that I am more than I am not again. We're just barking up very religious trees here and Addiction of any kind any hypernormal stimulus that decreases normal and again It's it's number 13 and john verveckis awakening from the meaning crisis where he both has that, you know, really I thought extremely helpful Conversation about buddhism and then talking about addiction and addiction is reciprocal narrowing where now your whole life is about chasing sugar and so You as a human being were made to be greater than your desire for sugar But sugar diminishes you and if there can be reciprocal narrowing can there also be reciprocal? broadening or widening to to use to use verveckis language and So now we're getting into this and we're going to get more into addiction stuff here Stimulus is going to end up being that bad for us I think one of the metrics for how healthy a society is is inverse relationship to addictive now notice We're looking for a metric for healthy Well, why would we need that? Because it's really hard and in fact 15 20 years ago again all this stuff is i've dealt with it in church stuff A friend of mine became the top executive for the denomination and his main His the main program he was rolling out. We're not going to talk about church growth Because well cancerous is that's that's growth without limits We're going to talk about church health and health talks more about balance. But then the question is what does healthy look like? well You know a my my sons who are in their 20s? Are certainly healthier than I am Um, and we can look at that in terms of numbers uh, blood pressure cholesterol we can look at all of those things but You know, what is the right blood pressure? Well, there's a range and there's you know, what is the right weight? And what is the right health? I mean that's again we're we're sort of inching towards The eschaton here, but but always with always with inches dynamics fascinating healthy environment conditions people that are not prone Because healthy would be about flourishing or thriving and again We're using more words to try to to say what? We don't have words for to addiction Which means have actual more authenticity of choice because Authenticity another one of these words that we're going to use which more authenticity of choice And again, I I like verveky's words agents. We're gonna have more agency in the way that again all these words only have meaning in the cluster and constellation of the other words and in the images and the pictures that we have and so Authenticity has become that of of course that where's my um, where's my Authenticity read charles taylor. I'm sure he has these guys have read everyone addiction compulsion writ large is less authenticity of choice and What's interesting is the hyper normal stimulus whoop and again, there's a there's sort of a Stalking these conversations are the questions of this the secret self or this second self or this other self Or this perfect self or this true self or and again, it's just christian language without Paying any attention to this christian stuff horn is to sex with sugar and salt and fat concentrated in a frappuccino or a Mcdoy's healthy for it not to be bad for us and we actually have to have a very mature relationship to it and addiction of any kind any hyper normal stimulus that decreases normal stimulus is going to end up being that bad for us I think one of the metrics for how healthy a society is is inverse relationship to addictive dynamics Fascinating healthy environment conditions people that are not prone to addiction Which means have actual more authenticity of choice because addiction compulsion writ large is less authenticity of choice and Less authenticity of choice What does that mean? That that some choices are authentic and other choices are inauthentic Okay, you just used authentic instead of true That's all we've done but that's the fashionable word now What's interesting is the hyper normal stimulus what porn is to sex what sugar and salt and fat? concentrated in a frappuccino or a McDonald's is to food right devoid of the actual nutrition or devoid of the actual intimacy concentrate on submits That betray the ultimates the originally the proximate stimulus Was tied to the ultimate and that's the the brain keeps track of the proximate And then you can disconnect some of these like birth control disconnected Sexuality from procreation right and in the same way if there was a healthy status relationship of in a tribal I don't want to run through this too fast because they run through that's the thing. It's a three-hour plus conversation But they run through a ton of stuff fast and and I love the Okay, so again now all of this stuff is a whole picture And so the picture is that well you've got the the proto human out there on the Serengeti and and sweet stuff and fat stuff And salty stuff is rare and so when we find it where we're abnormally Motivated to sweet to seek the sweet and the salty and the fatty Because we need these things and these things are relatively rare in the Serengeti and now in the American Suburban or urban world these things are all over the place But our brains are still wired for the Serengeti and therefore we overeat That's the contemporary picture and Okay But I don't know I don't know is that the picture so what then is the Healthy diet is it Jordan Peterson's meat only is it the the the food pyramid I mean the the alarming thing about It's 2020 for goodness sakes is that we don't even know what to feed a human being We don't know what human being should eat. It's like we've never met one and and here we're Here we're Here we're wondering well, what should a person eat well all things, you know, what did you learn from your mother everything in moderation? alright, so a little bit of sugar and a little bit of salt a little bit of fat not too much, but not too little and We don't even know but but we know we're having this conversation And it's a good conversation and we're talking about things or strange creatures Environment where I can't really lie and people really are what this can be actual nutrition or devoid of the actual intimacy concentrate on submits that betray the ultimates the Originally the proximate stimulus was tied to the ultimate and that's the the brain keeps track of the proximate And then you can disconnect some of these like birth control So so my brain keeps track of oh, I want this but it's not it doesn't keep track of my cholesterol levels Even though another part of us and all of these conversations Is always looking for the intuitive and the instinctive because that's supposed to lead us lead us where? Lead us to truth lead us to to to the kingdom of God disconnected Sexuality from procreation, right and in the same way if there was a healthy status relationship of in a tribal environment Where I can't really lie and people really are watching me and know me if I'm thought well of it's because I'm actually doing well by everybody and I have authentic healthy relationships and it's so funny because Did you ever grow up in a small town or in a small community? I went to I Went from K through 12 in the most populous urban area in America With pretty much the same kids because we were all in this little Christian school So about 88 of us or so went from K through 12 together So a lot of those dynamics he's pointing to are true But there are also some other Are the externalities where it's also the case look at family dynamics You can't outlive that one event you made, you know thinking a lot about identity with some other Series of videos that I'm doing and well, here's the thing identity is shaped by well What is what is identity shaped by you know, we're talking about same-sex behavior identity is shaped by sexual desire identity is shaped by things you did once If you're living in that small town or you're living in that family or you're going to school with the same kids all the way Through you did things once and you will forever be known as the person that did that And the entire community reinforces that and rehearses that and never lets you out of being that person That's what it means to be in a family in many ways You play these roles and for the sake of the group you inhabit these roles and and and and so A lot going on here as opposed to I can signal things that aren't true and not in a and even Get more stuff out of the way status through negative signaling about other people and things like that and Get a lot of hits from it. It's that is the same kind of thing as the fast food or the porn is and so I Think we have a hyper normal environment of the healthy stimulus that actually creates baseline well-being so most people I Find that when they go camping with their friends and they're in nature and they're actually in real authentic human relationships They're checking their phone for it's so funny when they go camping with their friends as if I Was just having a conversation with with my wife this morning about how the fact that I raided the church's Homeless supplies. Well, how dare I do that during this time? Well, why what was in the church's? People because they know I'm always dealing with homeless people and so they your pastor These are the things you're going to need to help with the homeless and one of the things they always give me are Again I'm sitting right here on my table Antibacterial wipes and hand sanitizer rare commodities these days. I brought them into my often, you know why Homeless people don't care about this if I step outside my office right now It smells like a toilet you want to know why it's been raining and it smells like a toilet because it's being used as a toilet And that's not very nice. That's not very Hygienic and they're living in a toilet. You think they're worried about sanitizing their hands Well when I go camping well camping is a very interesting thing that sort of started in the 60s and 70s and sure John Muir did it before but Going camping was very different thing than a mountain man going out west or in other words Relevance realization what exactly is it? And so then he tells this story about basically going on vacation with his friends and they're all on Their best behavior that's as opposed to being stuck in your house with the same people all the time while you're in quarantine or actually creates baseline well-being so most people I Find that when they go camping with their friends and their environment Most people when they go camping with their friends in other words most people go camping and have friends of The healthy stimulus that actually creates baseline well-being so most people I Find that when they go camping with their friends and they're in nature and they're actually in real authentic human relationships They're checking their phone for Dopamine hits from email or Facebook less and they're also looking opening the the fridge just blindly looking less often Because you didn't take your fridge camping because they're actually having an authentic meaningful engaging interaction and He's making a really important point here though that Even though we can't really define it and we really struggle to define it We define it very poorly when human community is healthy We're less prone to these addictions and again, this has been made in a number of different times in a number of different places that If in fact the mice are doing well They don't become addicted but dysfunction tends to reciprocal narrowing as Verbeke notes but in a world where I have a lot of isolation nuclear family home structures, etc Oh That's interesting and Not connected to nature and not necessarily connected to meaningfulness that much that Hyponormal environment creates increased susceptibility to hyper normal stimuli and this goes back to I Can't think about that book again. I can't think about the title, but this goes back to the question of oh Well, then why don't you live on the Serengeti? Where the sugars and the salts and the fats are rare? Why don't you run naked through those environments? I mean, why don't you choose that? Why don't you live with your cluster of 150 people? Camping permanently. Why don't you get rid of your cell phone? Again again and all the points he's making are really really good and that's why I really like this but There's something funny going on here Hyper normal stimuli happen to be good for markets Because on the supply side if I want to maximize lifetime value of a customer addiction is good for lifetime value of a customer And maybe I'm addicted to the things that being a business success Brings me But it is very bad for society as a whole And and that's such an interesting conversation that's a Well, bam, that's a value judgment just right there. Is that true? I don't know you you're just stating it This I really like so if I understand you correctly People don't I Mean this actually starts to solve a puzzle I Think I heard that somebody asked Matt Damon whether he enjoyed being famous And he said it was if I have the story right and maybe somebody else forgive me if I'm wrong He said it wasn't even fun for 15 minutes Which is I think true and I think it's insightful But then someone might ask well Then why did you start getting into acting and writing and Hollywood when that was the inevitable thing? you know if you went into plumbing instead you could have avoided it and This is the hardest thing to convey is that if you've never had any kind of status at all, right? that You know I think I said to Tim Ferriss that you only wanted to be famous to three thousand hand-chosen people What your calls returned, you know And again, I think that's tremendously insightful. And yeah, well, why why do we want status? We want status because it helps us get what we want Well, we've just had a conversation about the fact that Getting what we want is a problem You want to be taken seriously when you have something to say you do not want to be Universally known and that was the hardest decision in starting this podcast was I Didn't think I had another option. I mean part of the point of it is to get out ideas that I worry are Not institutional, you know, there's no institution that's embracing these ideas See thinks institutionally. I think that's good. That's right, and I couldn't figure out my tribe for four months Is there a way to do this without Becoming part of the story, right and because I think that privacy and an individual life is so much more important And that's so interesting. There's just so much interesting stuff about this end of this conversation Could I do this without becoming part of the story? But but what you want and rightly so is To change the story for everyone and part of the reason you want it changed for everyone is you want to have it changed for yourself and changed for your said children and change for your progeny And and you're willing to take some sacrifices and again, it's just all starting to sound very Christian I don't believe that every time you bring something up, you know It means that you should have your life ripped open And be dissected and discuss it's very unnatural I think what you're trying to A few thousand of my closest friends are gonna listen to this video less than 3,000. It'll be okay Tell me is that people think that they want to be fabulously rich. They think they want to be famous they think they want unlimited sexual access and In fact it is the first few tastes of these things that convince them that there must be no limit to how wonderful The world can be if only that can be mine. And in fact, there is something I mean, it's sort of you know, like rosebud at the end of citizen came yeah, those are much more like addiction and fulfillment and Addiction Will give me a spike and then a crash and then because of the crash I'm more craving something that will spike me because I feel really shitty and but then I get an erosion of baseline over time from the effects of that and So, of course the chocolate cake is gonna make me feel good in the moment But as I have a mostly chocolate cake diet my life feels shittier as I average right as I do the integral under the curve It gets worse. Whereas the salad doesn't really give me that spike But as I get healthier my baseline of pleasure throughout not just when I'm eating but all of the time Goes up because I have the capacity to engage in more interesting meaningful things and my body doesn't hurt as much and whatever So I think the interesting thing is that it is actually just like a healthier relationship to or a more effective Relationship to pleasure is anti-addictive But I think most of these things that people think they want are hyper normal stimuli That is the dopaminergic part separated from the substance I Don't know how much I believe this but I like it a lot. So if I understand you correctly there is a world of Pleasure I don't even want to call it pleasure. I don't even know what to call it. We don't know what to call it That's exactly the point and again There is a world of pleasure Think I'm listening to all kinds of 19th century Not very well written Christian hymns. Maybe it's much more on fulfillment That we would give up That no, let me say it differently what you're really saying is we are blind to the effect that somatic pleasure and status pleasure is crowding out fulfillment in our lives and that were we to actually understand the cost of pleasure of rivalry that there is an individual reason to Abandon somatic pleasure as the Be all and end all how we how we grade a life. I mean this is How many how many awesome trips to Vegas today that I have is that the thing that's going to matter most to me on My deathbed. Yeah, I don't think it ever has Read the road to character David Brooks eulogy eulogy virtues versus Resume virtues of this entire not this entire conversation, but the The difference they're talking about right there. There's a world of pleasure. No, not pleasure There's a world of fulfillment. There's a world of and how can we get to that world? Well, we need to we need to rein in on our desires and it's like my gosh Have you read the book of Romans? And I don't think it's ever what People would be most hopeful that they're let's give it a name because I don't think I've ever been down this particular route Let's call it deathbed mindset for the moment just to play with it See if David Brooks called it eulogy virtues versus Versus resume virtues works and if it doesn't work, we'll trash it So people on their deathbed Become focused on Did I do enough for my community do my children think well of me Well, I think what happens is people realize that everything they got dies with them Can't take it with you Like all in the end having mode versus being mode It's lineage only and the way I touch the world continues and it's not just my Biologic kid and in fact Eric and Brett's whole project is this What can I leave the world What will I leave the world behind me getting back to my conversation with a Couple days ago with when we talked about Nassim Tlaib Religions and the world and I think that's the most important thing A couple days ago with when we talked about Nassim Tlaib religion as risk management It's back to the patriarchs and not being cut off and and how do you perpetuate yourself into the future? I mean again, how can we have a future with us when we're assassin robots and suicidal? The lineage of my thoughts like memes along with genes and so legacy I Think when we really start to think about this clearly we recognize This direction is self terminating the need to get stuff from the world That when I die it ends with me that there is actually only a kind of self Transcendence and permanence in the way that I touch the world which does ripple ongoingly, but there's also this thing where Yeah again I feel almost a little bit shy talking about it even even more than the sex topic in some ways because I'm Proposing that there is something like spiritual growth. I think it's it is actually necessary for civilization to make it Let's hear that again and so Let's hear that again and so How did it even minutes in the way that I touch the world which does ripple ongoingly? but there's also this thing where Yeah, again It I feel almost a little bit shy talking about it even even more than the sex topic in some ways because I'm Proposing that there is something like spiritual growth. I think it's it is actually necessary for civilization to make it And so people Affirming that they are these kind of to themselves Needy things that need stuff from the world I'd recommend that we actually affirm that to each other because if we just admit it to ourselves quietly It's actually a lot more powerful to hold each other accountable to this. Where would I learn all this stuff? Yeah, that need other people's validation and attention and etc and living life that way where the more of it they get what they're still getting as a self the affirmation of that sense of self as opposed to coming from a place of wholeness and the desire Where would we know that wholeness from and actual love for the beauty of life? And the desire to have their life be meaningful to life that my life ends but life with a capital L doesn't end and That life starts to be central to my awareness more than my life is and my life becomes meaningful and it's I'm not my own That that in effect I am poured out for for you the Apostle Paul says coupling to life this answers the sex question it also it answers all the other questions, but and It answers the sex question because what is the sex question about? What it what is the only kind of sex we want if we go to the other person and say Lay down there. I want to have a good time on you No, I Give myself for you. What is that? Well, that's love Well, love is sacramentalized in sex. Oh and and and that sacrament fans out in your life and so You know, I want your sex but I don't want any other entanglements. Oh And we feel good about that and we want that and you know, it's again it's GK Chesterton starts out one of his books where he says, you know The the person goes out in a boat and they come back only to you know Thinking that they've arrived on the other side of the world only to discover that they've back on English soil I mean, this is what this conversation is like I don't think there is a there to break through to Yeah, and the problem that we're having conceiving of it in your mind now again I don't think this gets us out of all the issues that I've raised No, because we don't know how to get out of all the issues that you've raised But I think it's the first point at which I start to see that there's something really different about your perspective, so just Really different from what? It's the oldest perspective in the world As a slow learner if we take the kind of jurority an idea of all desire is mimetic Let's mention Rene Girard, but completely forget the main point of all of his teaching. Okay and I'm oversimplifying it but just meaning I want what other people have and then that Inexorably causes conflict and then the conflict will inexorably cause violence. I I Think there is statistical truth to all three of those steps, but not inexorable truth to any of them. Mm-hmm. I don't only want things that other people have I You know or that I That I learned from other people there's there there are things that are just in intrinsically fascinating to me or Or There back to the interest thing are wanting for other people it is not wanting for myself anything in particular I have a capacity for love your well-being at my expense and that somehow feels good to me Even though it's tremendously costly even though I can't sustain it very long Even though I somehow know that I am greater when I do it But I don't do it near as much as I I know I should They were just actually caring about wanting for other people there are innate creative impulses Right on actually need to see any like I have a friend who is a savant pianist Brilliant pianist and he almost never will play for anybody because his experience of playing is so beautiful that he doesn't want to cheapen it by having somebody else hear it and move into a performative place and Why do people close the door when they have sex? why don't they want to be watched and It just is his own communion with music itself Why are sacred places dark places till we have faces see us Lewis's greatest novel written with Joy Davidman who would become his wife so I think there is desire that emerges from our connection to life not just the social layer and Then even if you're doing something that I'm inspired by and I want to do something like that, too They don't have to create conflict. I can be okay with you having something and want to share it or share in that type of phenomena You make me want to be a better person the vision of Jesus dying for us Motivates us to want to be like him Yeah, okay now I'm starting to you know, I have a friend for example, who's a fantastic guitarist and I noticed that when we play together He doesn't play at his peak ability Because he wants the pleasure of Playing together. Yeah to to be that The thing that we share if I was a better guitarist, it would be more fun to trade things back and forth But the danger of going out of shared experience Is far greater and so, you know, yeah I I know the things that you are saying are true and Perhaps what I've been saying back to you could be retranslated as The transcendent beyond the proximate somatic pleasures that we have is so rarely experienced at Scale it's not experienced at scale. Well, oh little bits and religions in religion It happens I think that in in families There are things that people don't want to share outside of the family because they bond the family. Yeah and But it's just it's hard to imagine a world in which people stop coveting their own name and lights You know people Being impressed by by their car their yacht their house this that the other And I think that what you're talking about not hard for me to imagine well, this is the thing I mean, you know the odd thing that I have in being The friend and the employee of a billionaire is that I sometimes get to borrow his life. Yeah, and He's made his notice. He said that's a hard thing and and and that's actually deeply insightful You know I do a commentary here and I want to I want to highlight some things but I Have a lot of respect for both of these individuals and what they're doing here is hard Home available to me In Hawaii, for example, and it's absolutely astounding to be in connection with The world of the past I have another friend who lent me his island year after year But I also found that I didn't this dude has some friends that I've never met Want or need that and that both of these gentlemen that I'm referring to Were much more focused on ideas than they were on Fabergé X And I think that's a good thing I'm referring to were much more focused on ideas than they were on Fabergé eggs or displaying a Picasso or anything like that because ultimately They found they they wanted to go their association with me was let's talk about things that might move the needle in human history rather than Do you have any idea how much this bottle of wine cost? and and again after the other video too, I thought a lot about this about how Well, what did it take for someone to move the needle in human history? When it cost them everything It always costs us everything and and and and that's in this conversation talking about Andrew Yang Well, let's say you want to run for president. Well on one hand, you know There's a lot in it, but it it might cost you everything and you might cost you everything and you lose And and so why why do it well because especially if you've had everything Or there's something more that you want gosh, I Wonder if there was ever a story about someone who had everything well said Hart to Gautama. He was the son of a rich man But what if you're the son of God? Well, then you're the son of you know the heir of everything That's the that's the think about the political Social aspect of sonship in the ancient world and Well read the book of Hebrews, you know He why did he empty himself of everything in order to what well in order to? Actually get everything. Well, what what everything do you want? It's the salvation of these wretches down here below that as CS Lewis said are stuck playing with mud plies in the backyard because they fail to imagine what a day at the beach would be like it's because they they get distracted with sex and sugar and and alcohol and Status and all of these things. Well, then well then well then what exactly is what exactly is it? That that that our hearts desire more than anything else and we can't even describe or put a name on it But every now and then we can sort of imagine it Maybe there's a soundtrack or maybe there's an image or or maybe it's it's it's sort of modern marketing Appropriations of ancient religious ideas. Thank goodness. They're in public domain or or postures or symbols or Reinventing religion and Remember I was saying earlier that I think Dominant paradigms co-opt psychology to define healthy psychology as supportive of the paradigm Mm-hmm So what I'm about to say in terms of what I think healthy psychology is is not the current definition of healthy psychology It is one that would be fit to a to an actually viable civilization I think psychologically healthy humans are not the most Think psychologically healthy humans are emotionally coupled to each other so we're made for each other Hunter and people ask me. Well, can't you be a Christian and not go to church? I don't know. Can you be married and Well that gets into what about chivalry well, what about chivalry it's it's it's longing for the ideal Percent so when you're happy, I'm happy. I'm stoked for you. If you're hurting I feel that I feel compassion and empathy I think the worst Psychology is the inversion of Sadism where I feel joy at your pain rather than joy at your joy and pain your pain I think as a French expression is not sufficient that One succeed in life one's friends must also fail Yeah, so That is a perfect statement of what is most wrong with the world, right? That's that that is the heart of the worst part of gaming But I think jealousy is one step away from sadism Because if sadism is I feel joy at your pain jealousy is I feel pain at your joy or your success or envy, right? Jealousy again, this is all religious stuff jealousy is I the Lord your God. I'm a jealous God What does that mean something that is properly mine? You don't want to see your children polluted by the world That's jealousy Envy is I don't want your good. I want to replace you that's at the heart of evil That's well again. We just keep barking at all kinds of Christian theology in this whole conversation I don't think that is a psychologically healthy place for people. I think it is a Largely we condition this because we watch movies where we celebrate when the bad guy gets it, right? And we condition the fuck out of we celebrate when the bad guy gets it We celebrate when our team wins and the other team loses Oh, but pay attention it always happens in the movies where you you just defeat the bad guy enough to win the day And then the bad guy comes out back at you and then you kill them and all I had no other choice That's how we do it morally in our movies, right? So we can collectively decouple our empathy from other human beings arbitrarily so that we can then feel good in a war Supporting you know when that type of dynamic occurs and We get conditioned that second place is the first loser and all those types of things But this is conditioning again and conditioning of a highly neuroplastic species So I think our intuitions are all bad if we haven't spent time really questioning these things and then also looking at cultural outliers What Calvinism because I don't think any of this is inexorable is this is it ubiquitous? Yes Is it inexorable? No, but I think what is ubiquitous is psychopathology. Well, Daniel, I think what I've gotten from our conversation Is is that you've got a lot of examples that are at the proof of concept level of things that are underexploited You've got an observation that we're far off the efficient frontier. So so here's this Well, let's let's take all these ideas and let's talk about that And maybe let's have maybe have to have weekly meetings where I have one person talk to the whole group about these ideas and then maybe in the midweek and we'll have other little smaller groups where people will get together and and and maybe all together they'll imagine that that not only can we as individuals begin to Overcome these I don't even know the fancy words that they just used to overcome these little short-term gains of of sugar and pot And porn and you know all these little short-term gains, but we could all collectively imagine a better world where where These things go on forever and and then we can have art around it we can have music around it we can have stories around it we can have culture around it and We can hire people to we can hire people to maintain these institutions and we'll call them Pastors or or or whatever you want to call them it's you know, we've we've again like Chesterton we've we've we turn around and We've discovered England chapter 2 of of Now we're ready for Chester's Chesterton chapter 2 of his book But if it is a chief claim of religion that it spoke plainly about evil It was the chief claim of all that it spoke plainly about good the thing which is Resented and as I think rightly resented is that the great modern literature of which Ibsen is typical Is that while the eye that can perceive what our wrong things? increases in uncanny and devouring clarity the eye which sees what things are right is Growing is growing mistier and mistier every moment until it goes almost blind with doubt And when I read that I think about this this I see racism everywhere Well, you know it is I see sexism as you were everywhere. Well, you know it is I see status Conspiracies everywhere. Well, you know they are all of that is true And so we're going to tear everything down so that we can we can get rid of the we can I'll tell you how to get rid of the virus kill everybody that's got it Yeah, but you're trying to save humanity From itself and the really difficult thing to get at is the good and and we're trying to name it as Authentic or healthy or you know all of these all of these things, but it's it's really hard. We see the bad But we don't quite know How we can talk about the good? If we compare let's say the morality of the Divine Comet e with the morality of Ibsen's ghost We shall see and part of what makes Chesterton and Lewis increasingly hard to read is that these references are dated And so we're not watching Ibsen's plays Ibsen's plays are gone And when you read CS Lewis's the great divorce so many of the people that he's referring to are gone. They're not Contemporary we don't have slipping Jimmy here But but why is breaking bad and and and better call Saul? Why is this stuff such great art? How about the Sopranos? What you know? Why is it with dr. Melfi and should she really try to make what does it mean to make? What does it mean to heal? Tony Soprano so we can go on mobbing and killing without the inconvenient panic attacks If we compare let's say the morality of the Divine Comet e with the morality of Ibsen's ghost We shall see all that modern ethics have really done no one I imagine this is GK Chesterton writing in 1905 Okay, it's before the first world war No one I imagine will accuse the author of the inferno of an early Victorian prudishness or a pods Naps or a pods nappy in optimism, but Dante described three moral instruments heaven Purgatory and hell the vision of perfection the vision of improvement and the vision of failure Ibsen has only one hell in other words again, I you know Maybe it's unfair that I do that to Eric's podcast, but hey, it's better to punch up than punch down right? and He's got friends that loan him islands and he's commercialized his podcast and all of those things so He puts it out fair game They're trying to do something really hard in all fairness and good for them Because it's much easier to point out the bad It is often said and with perfect truth that no one could read the play like ghosts and remain Indifferent to the necessity of an ethical self-command That is quite true and the same is to be said of the most monstrous and material descriptions of the eternal fire It is quite certain that realists like Zola and again I have no idea who these people are and I could spend time and look at it, but I haven't Like Zola do in one sense promote morality They promote it in the sense in which the hangman promotes it Does the hangman promote morality sure does but he's saying that's what Ipsen's play is doing it It's promoting rap morality like the hangman What it's not giving is the vision of again these these things that we're groping for the transcendent the authentic the the the good the beautiful the the true it's it's these things that we can't quite grasp It is quite certain that realists like Zola do do it in one sense promote morality they promote it in the sense in Which the hangman promotes it and in the sense in which the devil promotes it But they only affect that small morality which will accept any virtue as long as we do not ask them for the virtue of courage Most healthy people dismiss these moral dangers as they dismiss the possibility of bombs and microbes So timely right now They dismiss these moral virtues as they dismiss the possibility of Covid being around I can't see it Why shouldn't I go and do that you can watch this play out in governor's talks and and actually Gavin Newsom on and on says I don't want to issue these commands I want to inspire people to meet the moment and I'm thinking good for you. You're doing it the right way Yeah, we could send out the cops and be slapping people with fines and and and you probably will have to do some of that but but you know Gavin Newsom, whatever you think of his politics in that moment is doing the right thing Modern realists are indeed terrorists like the dynamite errs Like the dynamite errs and they fail just as much in their effort to create a thrill Both realists and dynamite errs are well-meaning people engaged in the task. So obviously ultimately hopeless of using science to promote morality In the case of the general talk of progress again This is 1905 in the case of the general talk of progress is indeed an extreme one as Enunciated today Progress is simply a comparative of which we have not yet settled the superlative And when I listen to this conversation between Eric Weinstein and Daniel Smaktenberger We can't settle on the compare the superlative. We you know, we're authentic We're using some words to try to get there There's a vision and an image and and what we want is human beings are assassin robots And and we can't and but we have to try to do is is secure the future for us for the assassin robots No, somehow the assassin robots must be redeemed. Well, how can we? Well, well we have this problem because with sugar or with porn or with money or with status and and status is good And sugar is good and sugar has glory and it's sex has glory in it And all of these have things have glory in it, but we can't hold glory Isaiah Chapter 5 the parable of the vineyard. I made a vineyard. I gave them everything and what did they do with it? It became a place of strife. I gave them wine and what did they do with it? they became drunk and they fought over the wine and they fought over the vineyard and They read Jesus riffing on these parables and in the gospel of Matthew They took over the vineyard and the king of the vineyard came and and didn't like it What do you think that King will do to those people who took over the vineyard? We meet every ideal of religion patriotism beauty or brute pleasure with the alternative ideal of Progress that is to say we meet every proposal of getting something that we know about With an alternative proposal of getting a great deal more of what nobody knows about Progress properly understood has indeed a most dignified and legitimate meaning You can listen to Tom Holland say progress is Christian There's progressive revelation Jesus says to those who doubt him if you really knew Moses you would recognize me I Didn't make him feel very good. There's a reason they killed him Progress properly understood has indeed a most dignified and legitimate meaning but as used in opposition to precise moral ideals it is ludicrous So far from it being the truth that the ideal of progress is to set against that of ethical or religious Finality the reverse is the truth Nobody has any business to use the word progress unless he has a definite creed and an iron cast Code of morals in other words we can sit here and we can talk about progress But we don't even know what we're talking about and and and again I'm not trying to say anything bad about these two they fully admit it and Eric says I can't imagine it. That's honest and Daniels. I think I can it's it's friends going camping. Ah It's Forteists and and this you know people all we can't believe Jesus miracles because they were supernatural pay attention to Jesus miracles They're not just trips Jesus miracles are for kit for tastes Why if Jesus could raise the dead with the word and again, you don't believe that okay But let's just consider it in a narrative story form if Jesus could raise the dead with the word He could make people dead with a word Why do we have stories of Jesus healing and multiplying loaves and fishes and and making? immense amounts of wine and and Raising people from the dead and doing all of that and we have not one story of him doing the opposite Of taking wine and turning it into water of taking living enemies and turning them into dead men That's what we do and somehow we know it's wrong Where do we get this idea? We have well we can kind of know the good by knowing the bad and so we have this story of the knowledge of good And evil and whenever I hear that story, I think well they knew the good and now they learn the evil note They didn't know good and evil Now suddenly with the evil they can sort of know the good but it's hard to talk about Well rivalry has a part of it. Yeah, but rivalry is part of actually what makes us go Well, well, well, there'll be sex there, but you know, listen to Peter creeped on sex and heaven He says every time they asked me about sex and heaven I think about more about sex on earth That doesn't put me in the right direction. So so so but but we get these tastes of glory These tastes of glory and and this is what CS Lewis says with this great quote about you know, we have these tastes of glory all over the place and Well, there's two dynamics. I'll go further than Lewis There's two dynamics and that we these tastes of glory and they become stumbling blocks for us because we don't understand them Sacramentally that this thing is connecting us to another place And again, CS Lewis lays all this out in mere Christianity Nobody has any business to use the word progress unless he has a definite creed or an ironclad code of morals Nobody can progress nobody can be progressive without being doctrinal And this is exactly what we're finding in all of the the difficulties with woke religion They're getting extremely doctrinal. I saw this begin in the mid teens begin this to rise I started reading everyday feminism every day because I wanted to understand Their creed and I thought these people got nothing on the Mosaic code really It's and and when you think if you think Jesus is extreme in the Sermon on the Mount read what these people have to do You want to see religion? They double down the difficulty that they have is Imagine a world of John Lennon song. Oh gosh Imagine a world where there's no racism you can't and this is part of the point that Peterson was in Because it involves preferring some people to others Well, what is well you can go brave new world and say well never never never decline sex with someone Well, I'll tell you there's a whole group of women that are gonna have lines miles long behind them everybody waiting their turn Well, at least now we have a couple of women who are going to have sex with someone And I'm gonna tell you that's the whole point of this I'm gonna tell you that's the whole point of this I'm gonna tell you that's the whole point of this Well, at least now we have technology and pornography to facilitate this so we don't wear them out That's how we are We can't imagine the other world Oh, I can imagine a world without rivalry really Can you imagine a world without rivalry also a world without caring? You need caring, but it's got to be caring in just the right way You need caring, but it's got to be caring in just the right way and we can't even imagine it Nobody can be progressive without being doctrinal I might almost say that nobody can be progressive without being infallible At any rate without believing in some infallibility For progress is its very for progress by its very name indicates a direction And the moment we are in the least doubtful about that direction We become in the same degree doubtful about progress Never perhaps since the beginning of the world has there been an age that was less right to use the word progress than we 1905 he writes that But it is precisely about that direction that we disagree Isn't that what politics is about? You know the world would be better if it'd be more kind Absolutely, the world would be better if people were stronger Absolutely. Can you have kindness and strength at the same time? Well, how can we find an image of someone who is kind and strong at the same time? Whether the future excellent whether the future excellence lies in more law or less law There's a political fight in more liberty or less liberty Whether property will be finally concentrated or finally cut up Whether sexual passions will reach its sanest will reach its sanest in an almost virgin intellectualism or in a full animal freedom Whether we should love everybody with Tolstoy or spare nobody with Nietzsche These are the things about which we are actually fighting most It is not merely true that the age which has less which has settled least It is not merely true that the age which has settled least what is progress is the progressive age It is moreover true that the people who have settled least what is progress are the most progressive people in it The ordinary mass the men who have never troubled about progress might be trusted perhaps to progress The particular individuals who talk about progress would certainly fly to the to the four winds of heaven when the pistol shots started the race I do not therefore say that the word progress is unmeaning I say it is unmeaning without the previous definition of a moral doctrine and that it and that it can only be applied to groups of people who hold that doctrine in common In other words groups of people who hold it in common and are actually doing the work Where could we find such people? Progress is not an illegitimate word but it is logically evident that it is illegitimate for us It is a sacred word a word which could only rightly be used by rigid believers in the age of faith In other words people who actually had an idea of here is the yardstick Now I can measure progress Came across a very interesting piece in ION magazine is marriage over and they began with the story of John Humphrey Noyce The founder of the Oneida community again I recommend Oneida from free love utopia to a well set table because it walks through John Humphrey Noyce the end of the 19th century you know set up entire community we're not going to have sticky love And well how could you do it you could do it with authority and with a hierarchy and everybody knew that with him in charge and with the elders of the community in charge saying Okay you would like to have sex with her okay that happened and then pretty soon you had eugenics and that happened and what's fascinating about the stories you watch them in a tiny way Create a little society and there's male female equality and all of this stuff going on and the whole thing just breaks down And it breaks down partly because of you know if you're looking around for these little tribes who are doing sex in a different way well none of those little tribes are living in a vacuum What is the least amount of violence you need in order to create this beautiful vision Well Jordan Peterson noted well the amount of violence you needed to create the vision of the Soviet Union was quite a bit same with the People's Republic of China Right now we're getting this display well look at China and again Eric Weinstein he was also on gosh he's making so much stuff I have a hard time keeping up I shouldn't talk He was on Joe Rogan and I think again he said something that was really insightful he said China's trying to have it both ways and succeeding in some ways Totalitarianism at home and making benefits of the openness of the West and the West had better wake up to that it's probably true so much talk of non-rivalry So is marriage over? Answer me the question what is marriage for? Now if you read the article about sex and companionship they do exactly where Smektenberger goes Well there's this tiny group in China that they have this whole thing and it lays it out it's really quite interesting and I think well is that the way it should be? Well progress can only be measured if you have a should and about the best we do is we see all the evils that say ooh that rivalry not that not that Sex yeah sex is good but but when it gets addictive not that and sugar well sugar it's wonderful when it gets addictive what's not that so again glory Holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty God number one not number two I get a little mixed up the whole earth is full of his glory his glory embedded in all this stuff What does sex produce? What is sex meant to produce? Oh boy a lot of the Catholics are going to love this video Same sex marriage is supposed to produce equality read the article that's where it goes I'm old enough to remember the civil we're going to have civil unions and that'll be the same No it's got to be the word because marriage is supposed to same sex marriage the goal of same sex marriage is to produce equality that's what it's about and you can see that you drive down the street See a little equal sign on the back of someone's car that's what it's supposed to produce so again what is marriage is it over? Well I don't know read brave new world And then Rod Dreher had a very interesting article about Saint Mary of Egypt you know the Orthodox are always a week behind And so while the Roman Catholics and the Protestants were all doing Palm Sunday things they have liturgy and they're talking about this Saint Mary of Egypt and it's quite a story and Rod Dreher puts it in his blog and it's quite a story and it involves sex and levitation And well but to listen to the story again read Tom Hollens Dominion what happened if our desires are the noise and you hear these two almost daring to whisper about it and I love you when Daniel Smakenberg says this is You know I'm even more embarrassed to talk about this than I would be to talk about sex because it's almost as if there's a spiritual transcendent layer that it's what we're really looking for and the noise of the sugar and the noise of the porn and the noise of the commerce and the noise of all these things are getting in the way And so it's blocking my ability to enjoy the heightened so if our senses are the noise then heightened then their senses are heightened by deprivation in order to see what is most beautiful So the monks go out into the desert What about the business? What about the legacy? What about the inheritance? And of course the Protestant Reformation comes along and iconoclasm Family is the new church, monogamy is the new virginity, one speed rather than two speed, world saving is very old business indeed So where does that leave us? Leaves us to talk Leaves us to think And again when I listen to conversations like this Well Religion is going away If you listen to Eric Weinstein talk to Daniel Smakenberger Dare we say religious? Dare we talk about? Well let's just use other language like transcendence and spirit and let's just use all this language so we don't have to say those other words because we don't want to say those other words And then just a generation or so when your children don't have those reflexes anymore and they walk into a church and they say This is what I've been looking for Now don't get me wrong on the church business here Plenty of decadence in church The church had its day in the sun and it blew it But again Chesterton it keeps coming around Peugeot it keeps coming around Christianity gets decadent and dies And as Chesterton noted only it just seems to keep coming around again Would I be such a particularist and not a sufficient pluralist? Well I'm not saying that other people and other religions and other philosophies haven't discovered different truthful ideas But I'm sort of with C.S. Lewis on this that Well sometimes we just keep coming around to discover the same thing We leave England and then we're out in the middle of the ocean and we don't know where we are and then we spot land and we come back and We see it through new eyes We see it through new eyes Which book of his? Is it orthodoxy? Is it everlasting man? I don't remember which one but it's not heretics Chapter 2 I was reading from that So anyway another poorly made video I've just wasted a certain number of your hours doing very probably useless things But maybe some of you put it on so that my soothing voice would put you to sleep You have something to listen to in the car or when you're jogging or when you're stuck at home And you just need to find a place to not have to listen to everyone else you're sharing the isolation with Here it is But the main point of this is Plan B looks a lot like Plan A And the secularism was Plan B and now it's coming around again
