 Hi, this is Paul. Yesterday a friend called me, actually called me the week before, wanted to talk to me. He'd been listening to my videos, listening to some of the noises I've been making about my concern, about how COVID is going to impact my church, and yesterday pretty much gave me a trip to the woodshed. Now some of you might not know what that idiom means. Ronald Reagan made it sort of famous, I'm sure it was before him. Basically he said, I need to talk to you and he's a friend that has been following me nearly from the beginning, following quite closely, has supported me through Patreon, and he basically said, you know, you guys are terrible. He's somebody who's got a lot of experience in the nonprofit and the business world, and he said, you know, you guys are, you guys are terrible at the money thing, and VanderKlay, you have issues about it that you need to confront in yourself, and he was right. He said, you know, we've been following you along the line of your meanderings and your thinking and your yeah-budding and maybe this and aw shucks and all that. When are you gonna stop whining and do something? You know, especially stop whining about the money. Get serious or shut up. And so he had a little, had a little come to Jesus moment with him yesterday, and so yeah, it's time to get serious. What are we gonna do? He said, you know, Jordan Peterson, when he got on YouTube, part of what made it compelling was he had skin in the game. What skin do you have in this game? You know, my little YouTube channel has been a hobby, and I share my mental meanderings and what's on my heart, and for the most part, Living Stones has been supporting me, and many of you have supported me on Patreon and in other ways, and it's been wonderful, but COVID is forcing some things, and it's time to act. So one of the questions he asked me is, what do you want? Well, truth is, I want exactly what Jesus asked for at the beginning of the Lord's Prayer. Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven, and I don't want anything less. Some of you know my saga with Daniel. Last week, I was actually able to get Daniel into Psych Ward, which is good. He wanted to go, and we were able to get him in, which I thought was sort of miraculous, and he hasn't been here for a few days, which has been a little bit of reprieve for me, because he was knocking on my door four or five times during the day while I was here, but then I opened my door yesterday, and there's somebody else right in his spot, and this is the way of the world. This is not the way God intended it. What do I want? I want nothing less than God's kingdom to come and his will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Now, I know some of you are atheists, and this whole heaven and earth dichotomy you don't buy, and so on and so forth, but I was listening to Sargon of Akkad, who had a video out, why new atheism has failed, and there's some moments in that video when he sounded just like Jordan Peterson. It sounded just like John Vervecky, a religion that isn't a religion. Religion is missing, and a good number of people are nervous about what's coming next, because on the back of at least Christianity, the West developed what it did, but they can't believe in God. Well, I think what I want and what Sargon wants, I'm sure there are differences, but do we want to see homeless, mentally ill people lying around on the street? No. Do we want to see people going hungry? No. Do we want to see racism, people being judged by the color of their skin instead of the content of their character? No. Do we want to see, well, the truth is human beings don't know what they want. We want everything. Augustine's quip that my heart is restless until it finds its rest in thee, it's still there, but there's so much even after we're affluent and secure. We don't even know what we want, because we want everything, but when we get so much, we realize it doesn't satisfy, and the words that connect with me are, thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Dostoevsky, I know he had it in the mouth of Ivan, if I recall correctly, or maybe the older brother. I believe like a child that suffering will be healed and made up for, that all the humiliating absurdity of human contradictions will vanish like a pitiful mirage, like the despicable fabrication of the impotent and infinitely small Euclidean mind of man, that in the world's finale, at the moment of eternal harmony, everything so precious will come to pass, that it will suffice for all hearts, for the comforting of all resentments, for the atonement of all the crimes of humanity, for all the blood that they've shed, that it will make it not only possible to forgive, but justify all that had happened. What do I want? I want nothing less than this. John the Baptist was of course the one who made the way for Jesus. Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world, the Elijah, and then when John gets locked up, he sends his disciples. When John who was in prison heard about the deeds of the Messiah, he sent his disciples to ask him, are you the one to come or should we expect someone else? Jesus was just that confusing and Jesus was just that offensive that in fact they killed him. And this is Jesus' answer. Go and report back to John what you hear and see. The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor. I want nothing less than everything there. Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of Jesus. I want nothing less than this verse and what Jesus promised. What do I want? That's what I want. Now I know a good number of my audience are not Christians and I get that and that's fine with me. In fact I like my channel as diverse as it is. I don't want to have a channel with only Christians here. I want it to be a place where atheists and skeptists and Buddhists and spiritual but not religious and religion without a religion and all of those. I want all of you here. I really do because I grow and I gain from you and I learn from you and you keep me honest. And again I think the goals of the West broadly speaking are shared. I listen to Sargon and I don't listen to him hardly at all. I've listened to one or two videos about him but when I listen to him talk I'm thinking you know he's he's looking ahead beyond you know in post-christendom post-modern post-christendom and he's saying oh and he was he was riffing on this this video where my friend Adam Friended from Southern California was was talking about John Gray's seven types of atheism with Dark Matter 2525 who does these these mock videos about God and you know when I talked to my friend Adam you know we want the same things even though the United States is having this vicious culture war one of the things that occurs to me again and again and again is the two sides aren't that far apart well some are of course but there's a huge swath in the middle that that that that really sort of want the same thing. They do they don't want people who are hungry they don't want war they don't want unrest in the streets they they want people to to find jobs and be able to flourish and this isn't the Christian thing this is a human thing and broadly speaking I think as as Tom Holland has demonstrated the West is in many ways united around the morality of humanism even if a lot of atheists want to debate whether or not that comes from from Christianity I don't you know if you want to have that debate fine but I'd rather have you believe it then then then go off into some of the other ways well how do we get there well I'm a pastor and the reason I'm a pastor and not a community activist or community organizer or social worker or anything else is because I believe the church is the vehicle for application for exactly what God says and you know the police have their role and and social workers have their role and psychologists have their role and plumbers have their role and everybody has their role but my application is people and and for me the church has always been a place where people matter and a place where people's hurts matter Bill Hybels used to say that the local church is the hope of the world and I think that's right but the church has so often be then of so little use that that majority of the country just walks on by and maybe some say well I'm glad it's there and I guess it's okay for some people and other people point that's that's the problem and I understand you know one of the things that my friend challenged me on yesterday is he's been listening to me and he listens carefully and he knows what I care about and I care about my denomination and I care about my little church because well we might not be the most successful place around but you know what a homeless mentally ill person can come into this church and be welcome and be treated with dignity and maybe one way or another find a path to unraveling the knot of their life and many many others whose knots are considerably less difficult than a lot of the knots I deal with come and find a little bit of sanity a little bit of community a little bit of friendship someone that will actually take them seriously and maybe have a coherent reasonable conversation where together we've got jobs and children to raise and and schools to work and all of those things but maybe together we can talk about the things that really matter and we have a satisfying conversation with one another and and maybe maybe you'll walk out of this place and say I still don't believe in God and I'll say okay I'll still be your friend and I want you to be mine and maybe together we can make this world a better place even if we disagree on some of the details of how to get there that's what so frustrates me about the place and the political conversation is that so often there's so much commonality on what we want but people are arguing about how to get there okay that's that's worth an argument but let's have it be a discussion and let's not throw bricks and burn buildings please that doesn't get any of us anywhere The problem is that the church in many ways has been so useless in some of these regards more useful than a lot of people think because I'll tell you all over the place you can find people when someone is hungry or needs help or needs 20 bucks for gas they knock at this door they don't go talk to the manager of the supermarket they knock at the church's door because somewhere remaining in our culture is the idea that some place in church maybe someone will treat them with a little bit of dignity So what's but I don't know what the church looks like going forward I don't know the next steps of theology that God has us go through and I appreciate the Orthodox that say nothing changes and the Roman Catholics that change a little bit slower and the Protestants who are sometimes changing not enough and sometimes changing too quickly whether they be mainline or fundamentalists or evangelicals try to work the mushy middle these questions haunt me and these are the reasons I have my whole project my whole hobby that I do of talking at you into this strange machine onto the Internet that amazingly enough people listen I do it because I wonder and I'm thinking out loud and I want people to think with me and if you're a believer I want you to pray with me I want you to pray thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven I'm not going to be a Christian because when I see a homeless person lying in the street I see an image bearer of God And when I see communities that are easily marked by race And generation after generation Can't unleash the shackles that are binding them it breaks my heart So what do I want I think almost everybody listening to me wants the same thing I want the church to be a place where people can focus together And work together And yeah I think all the head stuff and the spiritual stuff and the religious stuff counts but I don't want it to get in the way Because the truth is in churches all around the United States and Canada and Australia and Great Britain and the world you find people of goodwill who just want to help And when Gallup did his polling and said you know who in the United States gives the most to charity not just religious charity but charity overall it's church people Because by virtue of the religious practice they have learned to be generous with one another and yeah there are bigots and yeah people get uptight and yeah there's all these things that we trip over But basically that's what this program is about thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven The blind see the deaf hear the lame leap like deer Isaiah 35 if you want to quote from the Old Testament for my Jewish friends How do we get there we get there together and for me because I'm a pastor the church is a big deal for that There are lots of other nonprofits and other religious institutions and other and government has a role government in many ways is just simply taken over many of the things that the church has done Sometimes it does it better sometimes it does it worse sometimes the government should do it and sometimes the government should let the church do it We can have that conversation too but the local church is the hope of the world because it's right there in a zip code And if it can offer a cup of cold water on a hot sacramento day Jesus is present A part of the trip to the woodshed was about money And within Christianity there's a real tension about money and that tension is in my heart because For the most part in the Christian Reformed Church I've let the deacons handle the money and the people at Living Stones have been so generous that Budget is made and sometimes people say pastor you need to talk more about money and I haven't and that's on me But my friend in fact he's not the only friend that said it to me last week another friend who's a businessman I gotta learn from the businessmen Another friend who's a businessman says it needs to have a financially sound footing so it can do the work and he's right And even though part of the complaint about churches is that pastors always ask for money and so I decide I don't want to be that pastor And a big part of it as I talk to my friend is well what happens so often if you crowd source these things financially is you have audience Basically the audience captures the speaker The mooks capture the night and I've always in my church life been very resistant to that Of course I knew in my church who had more money than who had less but I never looked at who gave Because I didn't want to know because whether you stumble in off the street and you don't have a dime or whether you come into this church And you have a million dollars I should treat you the same because that's what my master Jesus tells me to do Because I shouldn't use people for money And none of us should But the other side is also true that unless God is in the business of your wallet he's not in your heart I've just been preaching in the Sermon on the Mount and Jesus says that clearly there where your treasure is there will your heart be also And so I've got to talk about money I've got to stop whining and I've got to be more direct Now this channel has been my hobby and the truth is whether or not anybody I started Patreon because people pestered me And it's a clever pester because you know once you start sending me money and then suddenly I've got a motivation to keep meandering my Beandering my thoughts into my videos, and that's what I've been doing But I've sort of kept it separate from the church side and I've often said yeah, you can donate to the church actually I'd prefer If you donate to the church there wasn't an easy way to donate to the church some people sent in checks And then they didn't necessarily get tax receipts, and it's been kind of a mess so I've been working on that we have a new online We have a new online giving provider, and I'll go into that a little bit later They use Stripe so that should work internationally just like Patreon without any problem And if it doesn't just send me a note you know maybe try and give a small donation The truth about the church is that it expands and contracts has expanded and contracted through the short period of American history And continues to do so and we're in a contraction phase right now for the church And and I think in many ways it's warranted because the church is corrupt and the church is decadent And so the church needs to adapt to the speed at which culture is changing And I believe actually that the Orthodox and the Roman Catholics and the Protestants It's all part of the variability that in God's providence even within our rebellion that God is helping the church respond to the needs of the world all over the world And when I worked in the Dominican Republic these churches that were poor they helped the poor, the poor still, everyone was poor And that's what we're about and so we're in a contraction phase for the church and that means tough times for the church Jordan Peterson I think in many ways was sort of like John the Baptist He raised questions, he sounded alarms, he was a voice in the wilderness And in some ways his voice is silenced by his medical conditions But his fearless search for answers I think engaged a lot of people And through my videos and my meetup I was able to find some conversation partners to talk about these things with And along the way found John Vervecky, the religion that's not a religion But I thought Jonathan Peugeot's video, we live in these stories And Sargon had this other YouTuber he was referring to who I checked out his channel He's also doing comic book and comic book movies videos And in many ways this is the adaptation of the pagan world that we're living in the midst of But as Douglas Murray noted, what if what if what's beyond Christianity in the church is worse than it Douglas Murray says that as a gay man who left the church himself The church has a lot of stuff to do and it's going to take a long time to work it through But work it must and that's why I remain a pastor and why I remain a Christian and why I still work on this stuff Early on in my channel I had a friend of mine, Dave Snapper, on the In For A Conversation And David Snapper just has a hobby for him has been you know he collects CRC yearbooks CRC yearbooks are these these weird old things that the Christian Reformed Church this was one that's still in Dutch 1910 you can tell it's still in Dutch because it's before the First World War when they started putting everything in English Because the Americans and their anti-German sentiment wanted to burn down churches of the Deutsch Deutsch is Dutch not German please leave us alone But they have these yearbooks and my friend my friend David Snapper collected these yearbooks And has a whole set of them has been tracking CRC church numbers And when I sent out a missive on CRC Voices which is a an email listserv that I participate in And gave them some of my thoughts about you know whether or not my church is going to make it through COVID And how many other CRC churches are or aren't going to make it through COVID How many other small churches are or aren't going to make it through COVID He says hey man these churches have a 60 year lifespan There are some who are larger and and exceptional but the majority of these little Protestant cat-sized churches They last for 60 years in a community and then they're gone And Living Stones has pretty much reached the end of its natural lifespan He showed me a chart and he said you compare this chart to your church numbers and see what you see And yeah he was dead on right This is sort of a congregational clock speed And well I'm I've still got 15 years to retirement or so So you know 10, 10, 12 maybe I don't know it's getting closer all the time Just got a birthday And then I think well you know churches close in predictable ways You know first the first thing has to go is the full-time pastor Because they can't afford them anymore and then the pastor looks around and you know Do I come to part-time youtuber part-time pastor how do I navigate that Do I look for a new church do I leave Sacramento the only problem is if I get a new church probably one of the things Church would be all excited oh we like your online ministry And then the next thing would be don't spend any time talking to those people And I don't want to do that So to become a YouTube pastor or a celebrity Christian or a parachurch organization I don't know So I'm gonna try a Hail Mary I'm gonna I'm gonna go after a dream It might not work at all But I'm gonna go for it It's gonna have two elements the first is Living Stones Online what is that Now those of you who go to LivingstoneCRC.org Will find our old website And this is the new website it's not up yet I'm still working out Pieces of it I'm still setting it up I've been busy doing that for the last couple of weeks We'll have a website we have an app Now people have said to me you're my online pastor and I say no not really because You can't really have a church online Watching a sermon isn't going to church But what's happening now we're all watching sermons online And this COVID thing is gonna be around You know When and if a vaccine is produced will it be safe and effective how can the rollout go will it work We don't know any of that we're gonna be in this for a while And people who are already parts of churches are going online or maybe Sneaking into scoff law churches doing it quietly or maybe suing the government I don't know but enough of you are out there that you tell me you say I watch your I watch your Sunday sermons They mean a lot to me and I haven't found a local church And I'm a little scared and I've tried a couple and I walk in and all these churches want to do is recruit me to I see pastor you're doing the same thing all these churches want to do is recruit me and make me a member and put me Into their cookie cutter and so I Know that's the case And online church really isn't church But a good church is hard to find and some of you live in towns where there are too few and you've there are three churches You've been to all of them and You haven't been able to make it work others of you. You have 50 churches in your town and you're gonna you're gonna spend every Sunday going to a new one each week and So I don't I don't want living stones online to necessarily be a replacement for some of you But it is a place where you can engage in this community and again my my my I'm gonna tell people, you know at some point a local church is a local church But if you need this now, I want it to be here for you Maybe there's room in your life for something different. Maybe Maybe you're perfectly happy with your local church and and you go for the liturgy and you you receive the Eucharist there And you're on a good terms with your priest But for some reason the kind of conversations we have and the kind of issues we're discussing here are helpful for you in terms of Making connection with your co-workers and and living your Christian life. So and you've got room in your in your in your life for a second church or at least an online YouTube channel or something Well, maybe living stones online will be for you. Well, what can we do online? Well, we'll have teaching and I'll keep doing my rough drafts online and I've got sermons. I've got two channels some of you don't know that because one is quite a bit smaller than the other and Before kovat I was having adult Sunday school classes and they're one of the most popular things on my channel with a number of you Because in many ways I think out loud in my adult Sunday school class, but I do so much more directly about the Bible And so I don't know if it'll be a hybrid thing with our local one or living stones People will be participating in it. I don't know how we're working at it I'm working with my buddy Rick who gave me this and we're trying to figure out a lot of these things in terms of But an adult Sunday school class for online One of the things that Tim Keller always talked about what he did at Redeemer Press in New York City was that After a service at least when it was small enough, he'd have question and answer with the pastor about the sermon I've always wanted to do that But I couldn't really figure out how to shoehorn it into the schedule on Sunday morning And so I'm thinking of doing that online via zoom perhaps So we'll give you a day or two to watch the sermon and then we'll have a zoom session and living stones online You can come in and participate in the question and answer for the rough draft or the sermon You can watch the rough draft and ask me questions They're pretty close, not always, but you can always check on the church online thing too And then Bible studies, we had one individual participate in our living stones men groups We started a new zoom men's group online at living stones I'd tried that many times before in life But men are often, it's hard to get down here to church after they've been to work all day And so we've always struggled with men's group We have a lot of women's groups So how about some online Bible studies or online video studies or online book studies The thing is I don't have enough people or leaders at living stones to lead all these groups And so what we're going to have to do is find the leaders from the online community That leads me to this idea Pauline talks, the Apostle Paul talks about membership in 1 Corinthians 12 You're just as one body though many parts as many parts But we're all many parts form one body and this is members in Christ Because we're not really an online church I'm not going to use that word membership But I'm going to use partners Because you're partners in living stones ministry and we're partners together Paul uses that word too, the Apostle Paul The thing about partners is that they're not anonymous And internet culture is full of that So what I'm thinking and just thoughts at this point And so I'm gauging interest from you is that we would have sort of an online congregation Congregation is a congregation of partners And if you're a partner we'd ask for a financial commitment from you I'm not thinking pledges or anything in churches The tradition is tithing Many of you are parts of other churches or ministries But we'd ask for that if this is significant for you And if you can commit yourself to partnership with living stones That you'd make an online commitment A financial commitment to the church And to the ministry, to at least living stones online Because there's going to be some costs in this And I'll talk about that a little bit in a minute Right now our costs are We've had some donations to We've added a new streaming computer To the living stones last week's service You see that we're starting to up our game But we have a few more thousand dollars worth of equipment to buy To get this where we want to get it So streaming even just for our own churches right We're upgrading our broadband and we're doing all of this So yeah, money is involved One of the things I would want from living stones online partners Are community decision making I think if the people are partners in ministry Then they get a say in the direction of the ministry And I've practiced that all my life in church In the reform tradition the pastor works for the council We have a Presbyterian form of government So I answer to a board of elders And I don't know how we would structure this exactly But there would be a community of partners And the community of partners would make decisions So there's accountability, there's commitment There's financial responsibility And if we're going to do something online I want it to at least amongst the partners Anybody can participate Just like church, any person can walk through that door You can be drunk, you can be homeless You can be mentally ill, you can be schizophrenic Talking gibberish, you can walk through the door But a partner, their name is known They made a commitment They can be relied upon They might have lots of questions about the faith Their theology might not line up with everybody else's theology And goodness knows that's true in church And that's a dirty little secret that a lot of people outside the church Don't know that when you start to talk to people Inside the church, there's all over the map In many ways as many others But partners are committed to the effort And then up from that group of partners Then we'll find leaders for these small groups And partners will have a say in that Just like partners, just like members Having a church I'm just basically following the church model And seeing if this is something that can happen So if Living Stones Online grows Maybe additional staff people Who would part-time Or even full-time if it was grow large enough You know, have that ministry flourish Now, Little Living Stones We have a budget of $120,000 That's our yearly budget A lot of that budget is my salary And so You know, if you give to the church Most of it goes to supporting me That's just the way a little church goes The building is paid for The building needs some maintenance But we're working on that I don't know how this whole thing goes I don't know that any church has ever really done this If you know of one that's done it Let me know, I'd be curious If in fact this goes well enough And if there's a group in a particular place Well, I've got connections in church planting All around the world And maybe if there's a sizeable enough Cluster that's participating online Maybe we can plant a local church That would be cool I'd really enjoy that So Living Stones Online If you're interested I'm going to give you an email address To send me an email And say I'm interested in the partnership I'm interested in partnering I'll talk a little bit about that later But if you remember I said there's two new things So Living Stones Online is one thing And it's specifically Christian I'm a Christian minister Living Stones is a Christian church That's a Christian thing The second thing is estuary Now what is an estuary? Well you can look it up on Wikipedia Some of you know what an estuary is An estuary is a partially enclosed Coastal body of brackish water With one or more rivers or streams flowing into it And with a free connection to the open sea Estuaries form a transition zone To river environments and maritime environments Known as ecotone Estuaries are subject to both Marine influences such as Tides, waves and influx of Saline water And to riverine influence such as Flows of fresh water and sediment The mixing of fresh water And salt water and sea water provides High levels of nutrients in the Water column and in sediment Making estuaries among the most productive Natural habitats in the world The first thing is Living Stones online The second thing is estuary Now you might say, Pastor, that's a really cool image But what on earth do you mean? Well we've already been doing it Bridges of meaning is in many ways Part of my vision of an estuary Because although there's some complaints There's too many Christians We've still got some agnostics and atheists And if you're an agnostic and an atheist And recently we had someone who Really wanted to set me straight About your life and your life And he set me straight about Jordan Peterson And all this kind of stuff went on to the Discord And I told him he should go back Talk to these people We don't really need more Christians But we need more atheists And we need more agnostics And we need more Buddhists And we need more Jews Because an estuary is a productive place For conversation where the Fresh and the salty and everything Comes together In Northern California we have the Delta Which is this enormously productive area In New Jersey where I grew up We had the Meadowlands Now people have been paving over These wetlands and that fortunately Has been stopped Because they're vitally important For fish and for birds And for plants and for all kinds of things And what I'm looking for are estuaries And that's what our local Jordan Peterson meetup Has been And right when we started this Again I backed into all this stuff And I thought what pastor in his right mind Wouldn't want one of these in his church Or her church And because Jordan hasn't been Producing things we've been talking About renaming it a Jordan Peterson Style meetup Because the conversations People would go to meeting after meeting And they'd say I never hear anything about Jordan Peterson The conversations are interesting though The conversations don't necessarily focus On Jordan Peterson he's just how we got started But they're meaningful and they're open And they're honest and productive And their dialogo says John Vervecki said Because both sides leave Thinking I got something out of that That conversation was meaningful It was satisfying That's what we're looking for And it doesn't always happen Conversations are hard And they have to be cultivated And sometimes someone talks too much Or someone gets on a hobby horse Or pastors are just as guilty of that as anyone Estuary is a diversity of perspectives For honest conversation For often having the kind Of conversations that you can't have In public Of talking about the things you most need to talk about But have difficulty talking about it Anywhere And again it's not a Christian thing A lot of agnostics and atheists How's this different from Living Stones Online? Living Stones online Is Christian exploration and formation Estuary is Open ended It's productive, exploratory, meaningful, honest It's Vervecki's dialogos All parties feel like they Leave having gained something It's about meaningful conversation And building community around it That's what we've had in our local Jordan Peterson meetup And that's what I want I think every church needs an estuary Now why in a church? If you go way back on the channel I did a video early on With John Vendonk Who's been my partner in crime with this With Rick and with Joey And with Tyler And Todd Joey in the middle of it Says go and talk to a local Church and see if they'd be willing to host your Meetup and I thought Oh Joey, you don't know what's out there In church land But churches have had a long tradition of hosting Meetings and to get our Chicago Meetup going I Contacted a colleague And a Christian Reformed Church and took them A couple weeks for their council to weigh it But they said yes and the Chicagoland meetup Got going Churches have a long tradition of hosting groups AA groups, neighborhood association groups My church has hosted all kinds of Groups over the years and for the most part If It's a well-meaning group Usually Non-religious groups but if it's a well-meaning Group we'll host them NAMI, National Alliance for Mental Illness Recovery groups, neighborhood groups We've done it all And many churches do that And Joey noted that he said Joey as an atheist Or agnostic however Joey Categorizes Himself these days he says you know when you're Doing it in a church people are Their language is a little cleaner and a little Bit more serious about what they're talking About and He was right I had never thought of that And I was worried that people would be Afraid to come to church but we haven't had That problem And it doesn't have to happen in a church But I think every church should Have one because churches are too insular Churches don't know what's going on In the hearts and minds of the people around Them too often And churches need these kinds of credible Conversations that are on the edge And so I think every Church should have one That's why in a church and so I'm just giving it a new name now estuary And maybe and again my Local group is going to I'm very big into the group deciding What the group is That's part of my church background So whether they'll adopt that name Or not I don't know but this is what I call it Because it's how I've often thought of it that Our meetup group is an estuary where Where lots of things can come together And have a productive conversation Now you might say I want an estuary In my church because I go to a church And that sort of was what we were doing With our meetup tour And we made it down to Tucson and Chino And Bellflower And the whole northern half which we wanted To do Fresno and Salem And Seattle and Vancouver And Portland and Alameda the Bay area We didn't get a chance to do because Covid came in A serious bummer for Job who was all the way Over on this side of the Atlantic And John Vendonk who was our chauffeur And in many ways the schemer Who set this whole thing up Well do you want an estuary in your church You want to brand it locally But is the concept what you're looking for I'd love this to become a movement I would love churches I'd love Christian reformed churches But it doesn't have to be Christian reformed I'd love churches Orthodox and Roman Catholic Anglican priests I've had some conversations With many of you You want to start one in your church Happy to help And in many ways Participate in the bridges of meaning discord Right now that's what they're doing In some ways bridges of meaning has been a Prototype for this but not everybody can get on Discord server is a particular thing And we need these things manifested in different Types of ways And in real life Is the most foundational way And so maybe Local meetings post covid Or maybe meetings online now Does your church want help Starting one send me an email So this is what I'm thinking This is what I want this is where I'm going I'm going to keep Rambling on about everything I don't want to stop That's what I do for my mental health That's what I do to try and learn And so many of you Have been wonderful conversation partners And that's going to keep going And I want that to keep going and I don't want My day job issues to get in the way But rather I'd love to see this Actually become something That blesses churches And that have churches that That helps churches bless People People whether they're homeless or black Or white or hispanic or asian Churches that are All over the map In terms of Christianity And People whether they believe in God Or can't go there or what have you So Where is this at? Well I'm working on it That's why I haven't put out A lot of videos lately I've been working on it Whenever I get something stuck in my head It gets harder To put things out and I've been busy Setting up the website a number of you Have said you know oh if you need help setting Up things and I might call on you But this putting together These kinds of websites is pretty easy and it's a lot Of thinking about the picture and thinking about the wording And that's stuff that pretty much Is up to me to do but There'll be ways Online to do this and I'm working on those So like I said we're going to have a new church Website we're going to have an app that's Connected with the church and Working on all of that so Stay tuned but I'm Looking to gauge interest so if you Hear this and you say living stones Online sounds cool I want to be A partner Email me so here's an email address It's a little different from the one I usually use but I started A new email address for some of this stuff LSCRC that's living stones CRC LSCRC 1390 That's our street address LRCRC 1390 At gmail.com say Paul I'd love to I'd love to help I'd love To participate you know This is going to take some learning from my local Church too because this has been a hobby Of mine and yeah they're aware Of it and you know they're Interested and people come and visit and say oh I saw Paul online and so on and so forth But Most of them are Over 60 Now and a good number Are over 80 so this Online world it's pretty Vague and so This is going to take Some leadership on that side for me Too so that's that's where We're at but I think for the most part the council Is good to go because It's good to go or be gone And one of the ways to support is To support financially and I don't Ask for this hardly at all again My videos have been a project Of mine they've been a hobby But if you want to show support I'm going to there's a link below About where to give It's powered by Tively And it'll be in the notes and it's In fact I've made it part of the normal links Below my videos and so you can always find it And when I change the church website I'll let you know about that too Basically if the Church sees Financial support coming in I think they'll pay attention They are paying attention now but Basically online You wonder because online is Very slippery are Do people mean it are they serious And that's why the level of partnership I'm serious about because if Everyone's like oh we like watching your videos That's cool but I'm not necessarily going to Change my life because you like Watching my videos I mean if you're going to be a partner in ministry I'm going to have to have some kind of assurance You're a real partner And so We partner and one way is to express Commitment is money So many of you have been generous towards My hobby through Patreon I'm not Shutting that down necessarily Some of you don't want to give to a church And that you want to Support what I'm doing And that's great thank you for that And I'm going to try I got taken to the woodshed about my level of Commitment to Patreon I don't like pay to play And so I'm not going to start putting Patreon Only videos and some of those kinds of things I don't really like that Because I think quite honestly if you like What I'm doing and you want to say thank Thank you and your move to do that monetarily Which many of you have been Just do it Just do it It does motivate me sometimes It gets to the end of the month it's like whoo Appreciate the support helps me You know I got Three adult children living with me Right now during COVID so But if you're already supporting me with Patreon And you're excited about this you can You can stop Patreon and Try and try this And of course You know There's a thing for recurring giving There's also a little tab to pay the cost Because if you do it this way online There's a little extra money and so If you check that other little box It doesn't come out of the living stones money But it's They take less than Patreon And again this service uses Stripe and so I think pretty much If you're able to use Patreon You'll be able to use this And I quite intentionally Looked for a service that had the broadest Possible international Effort because only half Of the people who watch my videos watch from the United States And this would help the church see the potential And it would help me gauge potential Because you know we're not bankrupt yet We've got a little bit of money in the bank And our members continue to give We've We've lost members basically Because people are getting up there In their 80s and When COVID is done I don't know if they'll be able to drive And so Many of their adult children are saying Mom find a church closer to home And then they're going to be supporting Those churches So yeah This is where we're at And my trip to the woods said Put up or shut up so I'm putting up What do I want? I want God's kingdom to come That's what I've always wanted That's why I'm a pastor That's why I do this work I don't think that's a whole lot less than what many of the rest of you want My goodness if you've been listening to my videos You know me better Even than some of the people at church know me Because you've heard my thoughts And I try to be as unfiltered as possible In my videos so This is an exciting Challenge for me because I've often Wondered what can God do Through the internet? Can we really do Ministry through the internet in a more Credible way than to tell an evangelist Who's out there asking for money That's part of the reason I don't like asking for money And I don't want Audience capture of me I think when And that's a perpetual problem in churches When churches are captured by their Congregation and they can't be honest And they can't speak their mind And Living Stones has never been that way with me They've let me do this So This is what I want This is where I'm leading If you want to go with me here Again I'm still going to I've still got tons of questions about About everything You know me But I'm giving this a try So if you want a partner Send me an email Send a donation when you send a donation You know maybe you just want to donate You don't want to be a partner That's great too make it a recurring donation That's great too It will express to the congregation Yeah there's a chance that this could work You know it's not a it's like I said The whole church budget is a hundred twenty thousand dollars A year That's what it takes to run this church right now I'd love to see that Budget raised I'd love to see us have Online staff Or maybe some leaders Who are online You know so because I can't necessarily Do everything For everyone online I've learned that In the last two years So yeah consider partnering Consider supporting consider giving Thanks for watching All the links are below
