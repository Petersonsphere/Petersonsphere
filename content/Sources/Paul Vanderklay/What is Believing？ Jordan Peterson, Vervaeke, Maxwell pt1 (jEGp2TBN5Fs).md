 Hi, this is Paul and I want to do a video on Jordan Peterson and the leaf in God now Jordan's answer to this has been very interesting and everybody's noticed Jordan's answer to this and he keeps giving the same answer And we've talked quite a bit about it But there's more to get into with respect to this especially with respect to John Verveke's meaning crisis his videos that he's doing and Ton of old stuff So why keep asking Jordan Peterson about his take on the existence of God and why does Jordan Peterson keep giving the answer? He gives now one of the best one of the best versions of this interchange happened on firing line with Margaret Hoover and So here it is. Let's listen to how it unfolds and some of you've seen this before videos been out a little while and If my computer will cooperate About your personal faith Christians who watch you have listened closely over the last two years about whether you self-identify as a Christian or not And the National Review has which was also the publication that William F Buckley founded Has written about you the following That the effect is that the intellectual idol of millions of people is punting on the most important question in the world It is a question of literal metaphysical truth before this question of psychology Peterson has said that he behaves as if God exists, but he lectures as if he doesn't Pay attention to literal metaphorical truth in the question by Liam war Warner of the National Review It would be helpful for his fans and himself if he addressed the heart of the West crisis and meaning God yes or no Why not take on this question of the existence of God? Because it's not something to reduce to a sound bite Fundamentally for your lectures are two hours long This is true But when you're talking about the most important questions that people have ever asked and two hours isn't very long apparently People will watch them So I'm not I'm not prepared to I'm not prepared to say things in any other way than I've already said that I'm not prepared to say things in any other way than I've already said them You know there it isn't obvious what belief means People think that what they believe is what they say they believe. I don't believe that I believe that what no no What's interesting about this interchange is? Watch how many times he himself uses the word belief in this process because he clearly isn't afraid to use the term What they there it isn't obvious what belief means People think that what they believe is what they say they believe. I don't believe that I believe that what people believe is what they act out And so I said I act as if God exists. That's a sufficient statement as far as I'm concerned You know, what's the old saying by their fruits ye shall know them the old saying by Jesus Same idea Right. It's it's a matter of action and a matter of commitment It's not a matter of me parading out my my My explicit statements about a metaphysical reality that's virtually impossible to comprehend You risk when you reduce and I'm not willing to do that and I'm not interested in providing people with easy answers including me so There's a question of whether you're working it out yourself, of course, and everyone who's honest is working it out themselves. None of us have Incontrovertible knowledge about what transcends our understanding, you know, like I certainly do think I've learned things I've learned that the deeper I go into the biblical stories and into religious mythology in general cross-culturally The less I see any bottom you can go in it into it forever And and I've learned an immense amount doing that and much of it has transformed my life so and and I also believe that The that the West is grounded on the metaphysical Presupposition that human beings have a spark of the divine in them And I don't think there's a truer way of saying that and I also believe that it's true Now what that means with regards to the ultimate metaphysical realities that that ground the entire world I I dare not say because I don't know So I tend to try to say what I know and to leave the rest alone and And there's plenty I don't know and plenty I can't talk about so but I'm talking about what I can I'm not interested in joining a club regardless of what the club is so I'm not going to make statements of reflecting a certainty that I don't have so What is your so there? And that's the that's the answer Now I want to dig a little bit deeper into this and I want to use Paul Maxwell's Wonderful little video how any idiot can memorize the entire history of philosophy, which I think is a terrific title I think it's a terrific video and I just had a little interchange with Paul and I hope to Probably do a talk with him at some point. He's not he's no longer making videos He's he's doing something else But I thought this was a great video and a number of you have seen it and commented to me about it and I think the way he begins here is really helpful in terms of understanding and locating what Jordan Peterson is and isn't doing so so let's listen to Paul a little bit here and Even after teaching philosophy at a college level for years I'm still kind of insecure about my philosophical knowledge, but one thing that is and everyone should pay because Philosophy and knowing it all is really hard and so we just kind of scratched the surface I always succeeded in making sense of very unknown figures in philosophy is my basic conception of the story of philosophy And it is a very simple story and can be explained without footnotes or block quotes And if you can memorize this simple story, which is constituted basically by six words You will be able to locate and sort of plug and play any unknown or obscure philosopher now There are three fundamental categories of philosophy Which are these categories and they constitute six of the essential words that you need to understand Basically the entire story of philosophy and these categories are this metaphysics epistemology and axiology now What are these words every single philosophical concept falls within these three domains or somehow relates? relates these three words to one another so Metaphysics is the study of ultimate reality So if physics studies what is true of the material world then metaphysics is a way of describing them in the immaterial world Which gives shape and order to the material world? So for example the claim that the soul exists is a metaphysical claim More basically the claim that the world exists according to the laws of logic. That's a metaphysical claim Metaphysics is the study of ultimate reality So it explains not merely the material but the conditions in which a material world could exist So that's metaphysics epistemology is the study of knowledge Epistemology is the study of what we can know how we can know things and right and wrong ways of knowing So for example logic and evidence are two kinds of epistemology if you combine them together you get the scientific method So the charge is someone says to you, you know, you're being irrational. That's an epistemological accusation So atheism is a metaphysical claim, right? God doesn't exist Whereas agnosticism is it it's an epistemological claim which is that we can't know that God exists Now pay attention to Jordan Peterson's answer in this frame because I think Paul framed it really nicely so you have metaphysics and and generally speaking in The modern frame people shy away from metaphysics and they they were skeptical about metaphysics we can't know metaphysics and when I Categorize Jordan Peterson as an open agnostic It's in this conceptualization he's agnostic about metaphysics he's open to it he likes Discussing it when you get him in the right mood and don't get too personal, but he's an open agnostic. That's in it That's an epistemological frame of reference rather than an atheist who is actually making a A sort of positive negative Claim about the existence of God Jordan Peterson does not identify as an atheist I think he's best characterized as an open agnostic. And so here you've got metaphysics. You've got Epistemology and now the third category he's gonna go into it's okay So that's how you kind of slice the pie between metaphysics and epistemology with reference to the question of God So metaphysics is ultimate reality epistemology is a study of knowledge axiology is the study of value So within axiology false sub disciplines like aesthetics, which is the study of beauty and ugliness and ethics Which is the study of right and wrong and unlike metaphysics and epistemology which are black and white categories Axiological realities can be measured in degree So a metaphysical claim such as the claim the soul exists is either true or it's not the epistemological claim You have committed a logical fallacy is either true or it's not Whereas the axiological claim this painting is beautiful or you should have done better are statements of relativity and Statements of degree so every so every single philosophical idea is either metaphysical epistemological or axiological or relates Those three somehow So those are the first three words metaphysics the study of ultimate reality epistemology the study of how we know what we know the study Of knowledge and axiology the study of value now now the axiology and what he talked about in terms of Relativity that's gonna come into play when we get all the way down to verveke's video That's coming in a little while But just kind of and as Sam Harris says put a flag in that including aesthetics Which is the study of beauty and ugliness and ethics which is the study of right and wrong now the second set of three words which constitutes the six basic words of the story of philosophy are Premodernism modernism and postmodernism and these are three ways of relating metaphysics epistemology and axiology Premodernism begins all philosophical thought with metaphysical claims. That's what premodernism is. It's a kind of worldview It's a category of worldview. So multiple worldviews would fall within premodernism There are multiple pre-modern worldviews to believe and epistemology was determined by the pre-moderns By the nature of metaphysical reality So for example the first philosophers the pre Socratic's who came right before Socrates pre Socratic's in the seventh and sixth century BC They made very elemental claims about the world like all is water all is fire and what they meant by statements like this Was something metaphysical right? They didn't mean that we're literally all on fire right now What they meant was in the same way that fire is a flux The whole world is a flux and change is real and order is an illusion, right? And the pre Socratic's were composed of basically two schools the eliatics and the my lesions and the my lesions emphasized the disorder and the chaos of the world and the eliatics emphasized the orderliness and oneness of the world so accordingly The my lesions because they saw the metaphysics of the world as chaotic They emphasized sense experience as the proper epistemology Whereas the eliatics emphasized the orderliness of the world even to the point of rejecting that change was real at all and they saw Reason as the proper epistemology as opposed to sense experience. So the man lesion philosophy emphasized changed or Metabolet was essentially what their philosophy was about the world was in metabolet was in change and the eliatic philosophy emphasized unity or Lagos so metabolet versus Lagos and Socrates then came on the scene and taught the world to ask bigger better questions about reality So instead of asking what is the right thing to do a philosopher should ask what is goodness? What is rightness and in a sense Socrates taught the world to think meta about realities so to conceive of the immaterial realities behind our operational use of certain concepts So Socrates pushed for conceptions of important realities that could be justified and universally applied without exception So Socrates is student Plato took this notion of thinking meta and applied it to the entire world his claim Kind of in line with the eliatics was that the material world was less real than the ideal world In fact, it was the only world of ideas which was actually real See now if you again you've been following verveky and some of the work that we'd be doing there now We've got the axial age. We've got the real which world is real and that's Right here that's going to be very important in terms of which world is most real because you have the axial age you have This split that verveky keeps talking about you have the the world up there now Peterson Okay, is Peterson speaking within an axial age reference when it reference when he talks about God well for Peterson philosophically He in a sense he's see it. I'm gonna argue. He's a modernist. He's arguing when he's speaking as a Psychologist he is speaking with science and he is he is making his arguments with respect to the things below Now in my conversations with with Adam who runs think club Adam friended Adam will continually remind me that Jordan Peterson is persuasive because he doesn't get into metaphysics because once you get into metaphysics people will turn off because we can't know metaphysics and There's a popular conception of this and a philosophical conception of the popular conception of this is we can't trust Revelation or the Bible or anything like that because that's we we can't adjudicate it and What we need to be what we need to be able to adjudicate questions is science and reason So science and reasons are our basis for knowledge Metaphysics is unattainable. It's it's gone. So we stick down here And so Jordan Peterson when he's answered the question about God Jordan Peterson basically says I Don't have I can't get to God What you mean by God and what you're asking me about whether I believe in God Scientifically, it's unjustifiable. So I'm not going to go there now. I can have a personal belief But I don't bring that on into the public's public square. That's very that's a play very much of modernism very much of Secular governments very much of this secular frame and so when Jordan Peterson Demures, let's say with respect to sharing for him. What is private. He doesn't want his private beliefs He doesn't want his private beliefs Monkeying around with what he's putting out there, which she feels is his public science Science is for the public square private beliefs are for me and my friends at home again This is standard practice in terms of what's been happening with respect to that's the custom With respect to what's happening in the public square. You keep the private stuff private the public stuff public That's why Jordan Peterson keeps answering the way he does now. Let's have Paul continue So the material world was just a shadow of of the ideal world since ideas are incorruptible and unchangeable and fixed Well while the material world fades and disappears and Plato called these ideas Forms and defended the notion that we must access this world of forms Through reason through thinking of them through conceiving of them in our minds and that right reasoning was the necessary path to live in the real world Plato student Aristotle argued against Plato. So Aristotle argued that forms Morphay as as Plato called them using the Greek word morph a forms don't exist in some separate reality But they exist in the material things themselves. So in other words, the metaphysical world isn't just up there It's actually down here. It's actually in the things things things themselves are a metaphysical rather than being shadows of the metaphysical So take for example the metaphysics of a human being is the substance of a human being Is it an abstract idea to which human beings conform? you know that a human need needs to conform himself to through reason or Is it an intrinsic potential that he needs to fulfill in order to be his best self? So Plato would say that the idea human being is a form to which humans should conform themselves whereas Aristotle would say that a human being is a substance that contains both form and matter Which dictates proper action in order to fulfill its maximum potential Now again, if you've been following the verveky stuff and actually think big animation just did a really nice video on platinus I got there first. I got to be first in the comment section on think bigs platinus video I was so excited. So, you know again the stuff he's running through now in terms of Aristotle and Plato This is all stuff that verveky has been covering in his Meaning crisis videos So Aristotle's metaphysical shift changed the way he viewed ethics So acting ethically for Aristotle was not conceived in terms of conforming yourself to some abstract form of justice Like Socrates and Plato argued instead for Aristotle ethics was conceived as a balanced expression of certain virtues Which were inherently fitting to human nature? So for example take the act of facing danger, right? If you shy away from danger, you're a coward which is a vice But if you always rush headlong into danger without thinking tactically or strategically, well, that's foolishness, too But if you so so you have cowardice on one side and foolishness on the other side or foolhardiness But if you tactfully and strategically engage danger not shying away or rushing in that is a balance and therefore is a virtue Okay, so it's not so so Aristotle because he believed that metaphysics resided in the person It was a different way of governing why people should act rightly rather than conforming yourself to an abstract idea you fulfill what is right in a balanced way and Christianity was heavily platonic at its birth because the platonic notions of abstract forms Correlated well with the Judeo-Christian speech about like the incorruptibility of the divine essence and things like that There was a happy marriage between Neoplatonism and Christianity and platonic language served the early Christology debates very well as it sought to articulate a balanced Christology And it was through Augustine that Plato became the ruling architecture of Christian doctrine for the next millennium in the same way That Plato really emphasized the oneness of the world the order of the world Augustine Emphasized the oneness of the Trinity over the threeness of the Trinity and so on and so forth There were multiple other similarities a millennium later Aristotle made its way back into the West after his writings had been preserved by Islamism actually and philosopher Thomas Aquinas most popularly popularly used Aristotle as a framework for articulating Christianity and the Sophistication of Aristotle's conception of substance which we talked about earlier as being in the object rather than a form up there in the world allowed Christian doctrine to exit the realm of abstraction and begin making more sophisticated formulations about the spirituality and materiality of Christianity, which is why Aristotle gave birth to a whole conversation about sacramentology because you're really trying to Account for the coexistence of the spiritual and the material in the same place in the same substance, right? Now pay attention. We're still dealing here in metaphysics We're still in the ancient pre-modern phase where metaphysics is king and we're talking about what is we're talking about nouns as it were in a sense and and But we're talking about what is not so so there's what is What you can see and what you can do now again part of what why I want to get into belief is Not too long ago when I was taking a look at Maps of Meaning a Book that you should all be very familiar with by now Especially if you're following node in a network who's going through it slowly Subtitle the Arch of the Covenant Very interesting subtitle given the author's coy posture with respect to belief in metaphysics That's a very interesting thing. Yeah, I'm not criticizing here. I'm just saying There's a lot of interesting stuff going on But let's let Paul go some more because this is a this is a wonderful book I'm going to read it for you. It's a very interesting book I'm going to read it for you. It's a very interesting book Interesting stuff going on but let's let Paul go some more because this is this is a wonderful little video that he does here so all of these philosophers have in common a pre-modern architecture all the way from the Presocratics through Socrates to Plato to Aristotle to the early church and up to Thomas Aquinas they are all pre-moderns because The first thing they do is posit the nature of the metaphysical world and afterward They ask how epistemology conforms to that metaphysics then if we move from pre-modernism to modernism Modernism prioritizes epistemology over metaphysics This is called in history on this moment or this event in philosophical history is called the epistemic shift because it changes from prioritizing Metaphysics as the bottom to epistemology instead it flips it puts epistemology underneath and before Metaphysics and this epistemic shift is sometimes historically called the Enlightenment and the Enlightenment being defined as thinking for oneself rather than speculating about substances and forms and Modernism in the form of the Enlightenment is when philosophy really started thinking primarily about method not so much about ultimate reality So now now the Enlightenment again when you have this this modern move where you say Basically, it's a giving up on metaphysics and say well. It's too hard. We're not gonna. We're not gonna get there and the In the story that I've told in the past There's lots of different elements to this story one of the elements to the story is obviously the Protestant Reformation and there was the turn toward text and then the turn away from the text and If you if you listen to Philip Carey's History of religion and philosophy in the West you'll you'll get more elements to story And of course Paul is giving you just a rapid run through of this history but sometimes called the turn towards the subject and an Epistemology then becomes the ground and so when when Jordan Peterson basically says well, I can't answer the God question Well, I don't have enough time. She's like yeah, you're you're too are your videos are two hours long. So two hours isn't even enough and Because it's it's so so we're gonna start with epistemology we're gonna start with epistemology and and and we're gonna we're gonna go from there This epistemic shift occurred first in the philosopher Rene Descartes in the 17th century who doubted all Metaphysical knowledge he you know, he asked what happens if we doubt everything That's the only way we could be certain of anything is to mercilessly prosecute and doubt every single thing And then what's the end of this doubt? Well a simple proof that even doubt is a thought Descartes reasoned that even doubt is a thought which means that even if you doubt everything You're still thinking which means that the act of thinking can't be doubted Therefore the human mind exists at the foundation of doubt and he uses logic to construct an entire philosophical edifice without any religious or metaphysical speculation of Premodernism right so if the pre-moderns conceived the world in terms of the phrase I am which is a metaphysical claim Therefore I think which is which is thinking is an epistemological act So the pre-modern conception of the human being would have said I am therefore I think and it was a Cart who flipped everything through the epistemic shift right and and he said instead not I am therefore I think but I think Therefore I am because thinking is the proof of itself then along comes David Hume an 18th century philosopher And he took Descartes radical doubt to the next level. So he made an important distinction between impressions and ideas Impressions are experiences of the world So if I see an eight ball on a pool table and that eight ball makes an impression on my mind because I see it So if I see a cue ball on that same table that cue ball makes a separate impression on my mind If I see someone hit the cue ball into the eight ball and I witnessed the eight ball move Hume argues that I Impose the idea of causality onto the relationship between the cue ball and the eight ball So in Hume's view I am justified to believe that the cue ball and the eight ball And the eighth ball in the eight ball are real because they've made direct impressions on my mind But I am not justified in saying that I know the cue ball caused the eight ball to move because Causality isn't an object in the world So it can't make an impression on my mind and we're only justified in knowing In our knowing of things which make impressions on our mind We only impressed knowledge is certain knowledge or can be certain knowledge. So oh Hume also classified Morality as an idea before we get there I That split is interesting, of course because you've got the the rationalist and the empiricist was he's gonna talk about because The certainty for Descartes is I think therefore I am well, there's certainty certainty for for Hume is these objects and again now we're getting into We're getting into the the main fork at the beginning of maps of meaning the world conceived of as a space of objects and the world conceived of as a form for action now obviously a form for action is going to be quite a bit more psychological and We've talked about that quite a bit But but notice here before we get too far away from David Hume that this impression and the objects and all of this That's that's already coming into play here Yeah, rather than an impression and infamously declared is Doesn't entail ought you can't get from is to ought you can't get from metaphysics to ethics. You just can't do it There's no metaphysical claim that entails a certain ethical action so in other words, you can't deduce any binding moral concepts from the bare material world and Descartes philosophy is called rationalism because he builds an entire worldview based on a modernist conception of reason Meaning that reason as a way of knowing is the foundation of all justified knowledge Hume's philosophy is called empiricism not rationalism empiricism because he builds an entire worldview based on a modernist conception of Experience meaning that as the basis of all justified keep paying attention to justified belief through all of this, okay? Experience is a way of knowing is the foundation of all justified knowledge Then comes in a philosopher named Immanuel Kant several decades after Hume, okay before we get to Kant So justified knowledge that's vitally important here because again when you go to Jordan Peterson's question about belief in God essentially what's underneath this is it's it's Belief in God as an opinion is as a private opinion is justifiable that's how this worked out in the modern realm in the modern political realm as an opinion is is Justifiable as a private opinion, but because you can't demonstrate it either rationally or empirically It's not Justifiable in the public space now. I know Where's the book Put it over there, I'm not gonna go get it, you know when I bring in Alvin Plante again reformed epistemology You have this critique of you have what what Plantinga and Waltersdorf did was critique this this this system of Justified beliefs and you've also got Thomas Reed and Scottish Scottish common-sense Realism in there, so so that's also up for debate, but but the main project he's he's getting in with this And Kant's attempted to reconcile the carts rationalism and Hume skepticism And Hume skepticism so Kant argued that we need to make a distinction between what he called the numeral realm and the phenomenal realm The numeral world represents the world as it really is the world of ideas in Descartes, right? And the phenomenal world represents the world as it exists in our perception. So the world of impressions in Hume So if a tree falls in the woods and nobody's there to witness it did anything happen? Numinally speaking. Yes, it did phenomenally speaking No, it did not and we only have access to the phenomenal world But there is a mechanism in our mind called the transcendental Which translates the numeral realm for us and displays the phenomenal world in our perception like a movie projector, right? To use another metaphor think of the transcendental The transcendental operating in your mind which Kant posit is Posits translates the numeral to the phenomenal for us think of it like a sausage maker So imagine the numeral world is the raw material of sausage and the phenomenal world is the processed packaged sausage link Now imagine you go to a grocery store and you read on the label that the sausage is made of the highest quality pork And it's organic, right? So you try to visit the sausage factory to verify that the sausage is organic and that all the materials are high quality But they won't let you in for security reasons for sanitary reasons, right? And that seems understandable to you Why would they let some rando walk into their sausage factory, right? So you decide, you know, I'm just gonna trust the sausage company Kant argues that we need to take the same posture toward the transcendental We will never have justified knowledge of the world as it really is will never be a Justified knowledge of the world to escape our mind We can never make it to the sausage factory to visit to verify whether our experience of the world Conforms to the actual world all we have is our experience and in that sense Hume's critique of Descartes is correct Since all we have our sense experiences But we should trust that the transcendental gives to us in the form of the phenomenal world What is practically true and therefore while we may not be epistemologically justified in assuming that our claims about the phenomenal world Translate to the numinal we are practically justified in assuming that the laws of logic Can establish common rules of perception that govern everyone's mind and therefore work as common rules Which human beings are justified in taking for granted So Kant likewise attempts and you can see us moving over here towards axiology as we move through this process To rectify Hume's moral crisis of saying you can't move from is to ought by proposing what he calls the categorical imperative Which is the notion that a moral law is binding if it can be universalized so for example lying or not telling the truth right purposely to deceiving other people is categorically wrong because if Everybody lied all the time there would be no such thing as truth-telling and therefore no such thing as lying So therefore lying should be morally wrong because to universalize it would be to destroy the possibility of the concept itself same thing for adultery and murder and even homosexuality Kantian arguments have been made and then comes along philosopher Georg Hegel now we're gonna hold on to Hegel until a little bit later So let's let's keep it let's keep it here for now got the ancient the pre-modern the modern the post-modern You've got metaphysics epistemology and axiology. Those are your six words that he gives you to sort of orient your Understanding of philosophy and now we see very much we can very easily locate Jordan Peterson as a modernist He is he is skeptical about metaphysical. He's skeptical about the numeral realm He is trying really hard through Piaget and Jung and many others to to be able to say Justifiable justifiable things about metaphysics, but he stopped short He may talk about these things in private, but he's not going to bring them out into the public sphere where science is governing because that would be inappropriate that would he he doesn't have Knowledge, okay, he doesn't have knowledge of that now we could bring in Dallas Willard It'd be wonderful if Dallas Willard were alive to have a conversation with Jordan Peterson. That would be one of the conversations I would so love to have Jordan Peterson and Dallas Willard, but Dallas Willard is no longer here. So we must move on Then Jordan Peterson goes to Liberty University And of course Liberty University is a place where they're not shy about saying we believe in God and David Nassar is not shy about Inviting Jordan Peterson to believe in God and Jordan Peterson goes willingly right in there to Liberty University When Christians start talking God and Christ as God they start talking metaphysics and they don't feel embarrassed by it They don't feel like this is something that's only appropriate in private. This is something for the public sphere This is something for the public realm And so some in the modern view say that these Christians are in fact anachronistic They are like dinosaurs and they're out there in the public sphere talking about God and you could when we'd watch the we'd watch these separated Magisteria so Amazingly portrayed the tension was just there on stage with Peterson and you got Gary Habermas and he's gonna do a deal there to get Jordan Peterson to believe in the historicity and the physicality of the resurrection and maybe Gary Habermas can undo the Pressuring that Sam Harris did and in their other conversation so Jordan Peterson says I live as though God exists because why because God number one dismissed after Darwin We don't need God number one for biology and geology but Jordan Peterson comes around it says we really do need him for psychology and we And we really do need him for ethics and this metaphorical foundation he used that word on the day Rubin report this metaphorical foundation is is Necessary for Western culture and if we lose that we lose everything else There's something that's haunting us there because We still have to basically live on top of Hume and Descartes and the uneasy empiricism rationalism we must still maintain ourselves upon epistemology we Can't we were skeptical about metaphysics and we can't go there So he's an agnostic he sees a pragmatist value is Evident and and when we play the little clip, I'm gonna play a little bit of him and Nasser talking, you know The that's that's the level of certainty that he can have and we're talking about someone in a a making life better We'll get there in a minute. That's what we're dealing with. But now of course Nasser is a Christian Christians start with metaphysics. They're ancient people in many ways They start with metaphysics and God says I am in the book of Exodus and it's gonna be very Interesting to hear Jordan Peterson get to the burning bush and get to God naming himself and Maybe I should be there for the Q&A when Jordan Peterson does Exodus because I I'd really love to because when you when you see this in terms of metaphysics and epistemology and understand the pre-modern and the modern you can you can understand why this stuff takes the shape that It does but now let's listen to these two talk a little bit And especially to to this preaching to ourself idea sit on the edge of your bed And to think look There are things I'm doing there are things I'm not doing This is this is Jordan Peterson at prayer. Remember it was in the it was in the Sam Harris conversations It was in the convocation conversation. This is this is where in many ways Jordan Peterson has this experience of This open experience of God number two, but it's it's he's sitting on the edge of his bed Okay, he's not sitting in a public church. He's on the edge of his bed This is a private space and he's having and and so this is Jordan sharing but this is this is not science We're doing here. This is this is this is exploration That I should be doing that I could and would do small things You don't want to get grandiose But you can you can start to improve your life incrementally by eliminating those things that are Self-evidently making you bitter and miserable But you have to decide that that's what you want you are willing to burn off that dead wood to sacrifice Mortification burning off that dead wood. It's this this is we have access to this knowledge We can we can make our life better We have access to meaning meaning is for Jordan Peterson in a sense a little internal gyroscope And when we feel meaning kicking in this is within the iron box of secularism Hints of the stars outside and we should follow that meaning and move towards it It's that bitterness and that unhappiness even though you may feel that you're justified in In in harboring it you may even be justified in harboring it because people have very hard lives And sometimes they're very badly mistreated But you need to think it's okay if things improve and it would be worthwhile for me to start to abandon my Well, you could say my sin my failure to make the mark, right? My failure to take proper aim but to abandon those things that I'm doing that I know to be harmful to myself. What would you say? Do you pastors who think well? pastors Liars like us and because you know Well, let's let them talk a little bit more because we're gonna see some of Jordan Peterson's biases with respect to pastors Why would you stop short of trying to get them to self-help or try to get them to? When you could go even further with them, not just only deal with the symptoms and those things but just actually then Provide them a faith that well with okay right there. So David Nasser. He's revealing his Philosophical system. He is a Christian. He believes with metaphysics God is more real than I am and you see Jordan play Peterson plays with that, you know when it comes to when it comes to Jordan Peterson plays with that when it comes to you know the the story fiction can be more real than the individual and he plays with those ideas and and part of that is the is the Because we don't really have access to a platonic Monarchical vision where we see clearly from above or we access the forms directly we essentially Approximate it by crowd sourcing a monarchical vision And so when we see what is real for many people that in a sense is more real than just what it is for me But right away you've got the the tension between Plato and Aristotle right there again So you've got this approximated monarchical vision and an Aristotelian real thing down below here and you're saying well Which is more real but now now David Nasser is saying why would you give them the little answer for them? When you can give them the whole plate, which is God the metaphysic the Foundation the thing upon which we build But Peterson's gonna be skeptical about that and you're gonna hear that and right away is skepticism is gonna rely on well See Peterson doesn't think the pastor can know this that's not knowledge that knowledge is not Accessible within the modern frame we have dismissed Metaphysical knowledge and so the best we can do within the iron box of secularism is try to navigate with our Gyroscopes and our progress approximations of what is better or worse right now, and this is sort of like Sam Harris's a B testing for good is this better than this is sobriety better than alcoholism. Yes good Well, we know that so let's let's work towards that is is is maybe having two drinks better than having eight drinks Yeah, if you can handle two drinks and stop there, that's better than eight drinks But but now pay attention, of course Nasser's got metaphysics down below and then epistemology and then axiology That's his structure. And so David Nasser is gonna say hey Why not why not give the guy God? Instead of you know playing around with sobriety What you know sobriety now we're gonna get into a little Augustine sobriety is whispers of what's outside the box and and and Jordan Peterson's always trying to figure out how we can see through the box how we can navigate by the Stars how we can know these things, but he's still in this box and well and at the end We're gonna ask. Well, what is this box constructed of and why is he afraid to get out of the box? Bigger than that pastor you probably should ask that question. I mean the the issue is Little tell there a situation like that is that you have to govern your response to the person in accordance with that person ah Ah Okay, now the individual now now there's a there's a hierarchy of knowledge that's operating here So so don't so so you hear Jordan Peterson's reluctance to get into metaphysics. Let's keep it pragmatic here because pragmatism pragmatism is all about You read the Metaphysical Club and Charles Pierce and statistics and you know We might not our tools aren't accurate enough to really tell us Incredibly accurate to give us certain knowledge about the location of the stars Let's say but via statistics we can get close enough and so Peterson's pragmatism is that work here and and you know pastors pastors have lots of biases involved and and lots of things and so Let's let's be a little suspicious about the pastors motivation And I'm not doubting that because I know pastors and I know we lie and we've got all these other Motivations and as my friend once told me pastors are Kingdom builders. They build their own Kingdom So I'm not doubting Jordan Peterson's Faith in pastors. Let me tell you But what is what he's revealing are his philosophical categories? You know you have to see Where they're willing to go next like and you want to make sure that your destination which might be Which could be let's say your pride in your role in their salvation, right for example And David Nassar knows he's seen plenty of pastors do plenty of bad stuff And so I I've got a world of respect for David Nassar the the tiny little bit that I know about him He's he's an honest, dude He's he's willing to he's willing to fess up and break the pastors union and say yeah pastors You gotta watch those critters. They can be really slick Oh, yeah doesn't interfere with your Careful noticing of what it is that they need right here and now knowledge and So you you you you want to push people to their limit? But but to their genuine limit you have to have knowledge where their limit is You don't want to tear the fabric of trust like no You don't want to tear this fabric of truck What trust are you talking about the trust between the trust between the pastor and the person you're working with And all fairness the same goes for the psychological profession in clinical psychology. You don't want to clinical psychologists just like pastors have their own motivations and Because they're all people oh And then you don't want to make them you don't want to make them into puppets of your desire That's what pastors do don't they and they really do you can lead people but you can't You can't he really means you shouldn't let's say you can't remake them like it you can lead them and and to lead someone appropriately Shouldn't you need to know where they are and that means you have to pay attention and I would say well Pastors don't pay attention for some people The religious approach initially might be the right one there's some evidence for that through the right one the right one in terms of what? The right one of achieving what goal the right one of achieving sobriety escape from alcoholism so so Peterson as a good modernist says religion can work towards the goal of going from Alcohol from from from from ruinous alcoholism to sobriety, okay example in the treatment of alcoholism, I mean the alcoholism literature indicates quite clearly that Perhaps the only effective known Treatment for alcoholism is actually religious conversion I mean sometimes people stop of their own accord and we don't exactly understand why but religious conversion actually seems to be quite effective And it isn't clear why the 12-step people capitalize on that and There hasn't been good scientific studies of the effectiveness of the 12-step program because it's hard to do controlled studies but well because because I think I sat with a gentleman one time who who is a 12 step program guru he travels the world. So he said hey wait, what are you doing? And I tell him I travel and speak and he said oh I travel and speak and I told he said what are you going to? And I said I'm going to this church and I'm you know, I'm gonna go preach and he said I'm going to a rally and Alcoholics anonymous rally and he pulled out his coin and he said, you know I've been sober and he gave me the days was a long time and he said and I said well, how do you begin? I said yes me. I'm sorry. He said I'm being and I said I always began with the word I always open up the Bible to make sure I'm not you know, that's the foundation of anything I have to say Okay, so now we've got some foundationalism going here too and so the Let's say a little bit more people ultimately don't need my opinion. They need the truth I don't and he said I always began with the same. This is interesting. He said I always began with Hi, my name is and I am an alcoholic He says because we believe once an alcoholic always an alcoholic. Ah Okay. Now we're dealing again with Beliefs and these beliefs have to do with that which is most true and So you've got David Nassar beginning with his his Bible and saying well, here's my Bible that's true and You've got the alcoholics saying well now we're gonna start playing with identity statements and Nassar is gonna go into that in a minute The alcoholic begins with an identity statement and says well, you know and and a is sort of famous for hovering above the metaphysics and and staying in the the axiology staying in the practicality of Of the should of getting free of alcohol and says well It doesn't matter who you are doesn't matter what you say you believe Remember Jordan Peterson saying well people say they believe things They don't really believe those things because they don't act them out, which is a great point Which is actually the Bible makes that point too But they say they believe something and what they say they believe really isn't connected to what they what they actually believe so there's sort of a hidden knowledge that they're disconnected from themselves and So well, how do you begin? Well, you're gonna begin with that. We're gonna begin with identity and so the the the the speaker for a says I am an alcoholic that's my identity and I have to stay away from alcohol. That's he begins with the truth Now David Nassar with his form of biblicism also begins with the truth. So well, I start with the word I don't believe with me. So I start with a word. So you've got these two systems working right there now watch how Nassar begins to Leverage identity because in a sense What skepticism about metaphysics? People don't even know the word epistemology. They're just acting Let's call it naive realism. They're just they're just living with they are they but they're gonna start with something and in a rather day cart Move I am I am what I am an alcoholic or I am a Christian and I'm gonna build on that identity and I'm gonna go from there Right, and I said you haven't taken a drink in 1100 days or whatever. He said he said yeah, he said I teach people He said but we believe one I said that's the difference for us We as believers believe I once was lost but now I'm found I once was salt but now I'm Paul a Transformational identity. Okay, so keep that word in mind when we get to verveky is that there's there's a something Transformative has happened and Jordan Peterson has said yeah this transformation that can release people from alcohol But but they're both identity and one will say I once was lost but now I'm found I am a Christian I am a child of the king. I am a servant of Jesus. I am a believer There's identity do I believe see and this is where the the belief do I believe in God? I'm not interested in joining a club any club. What did you join the IDW? It's kind of a club Did you join the in the staff of the University of Toronto? It's kind of a club Do you not interested in joining a Christian club? But identity I Am an alcoholic therefore this I am a Christian therefore this and David's gonna work that out a little bit here I once was an alcoholic, but now I have a new identity So are we just preaching to ourselves? Does this now now what are we just preaching to ourselves? I love NASA I sure really love this video, you know, it just he's just opening the doors and here you go Jordan Are we are we is there something to this now your skepticism that you're skeptical about metaphysics And so you're beginning with epistemology just like Paul Maxwell ran through it so beautifully Uh Can we can we can we go like this? Can we start with identity and build up from there? Please be just very honest with me Is that oh we just know lathering it up and preaching that to ourselves because we've lathering it up and preaching it to us What does he mean by that? Are we deluding ourselves? Are we do we have Dumbo's feather here? Are we standing in the mirror and saying I'm handsome? I have long flowing hair and people like me. Is that what we're doing here Jordan tell us You've seen the evidence of saying to someone when Christ gives you a new identity You can You're no longer a slave to the things that you were slave to you're now a slave to righteousness Now what are we using here? Where it's an assertion and we're also using a story we're using a story about and one of my good friends preacher over the Folsom church plant that we have and Actually his buddy who's now chaplain at Wheaton says, you know You can tell the Christian story in two things you have identity and you have narrative and between those two things You can pretty much get most of what you're looking for and there's identity in their narrative So here's here's the identity and you know, I am a Christian and there's the narrow was lost but now I'm found There's narrative a narrative of transformation and that narrative is built within a much bigger narrative And again, this is all built upon a metaphysic. It was ancient pre-modern Approach Now growing in that identity doesn't mean there's not a struggle doesn't mean there's not temptation that you can fall into And understand your weak points I think it's more of a cautionary technique on the part of the 12-step people now now Peterson is gonna critique the This a little bit and it's kind of a sidebar but we're used to that with Jordan We're gonna come back to it. They assume that alcohol especially for people who are really susceptible to alcoholism is sufficiently Powerful, but notice he isn't answering the question Which is are we just preaching to ourselves is that is that is this is this Dumbo's feather is this woo So that some people can't risk any relapse and I think that's true with alcohol it it's it's a very dangerous drug and I think that that is true for a minority of people there are studies of Alcoholic recovery in the alcoholism treatment literature and I haven't looked at that literature for a long time Arguments still hadn't been settled but it is quite clear that for some people Alcohol is so dangerous that it's safer for them to assume that they don't have the Wherewithal to make a single error, but remember they're talking about Something that's a fairly focal part of their life, right? They say well I have this one Overwhelming temptation and I have to treat it with with Tremendous respect your question is more about personality transformation in general and And how it plays out even into the trenches of? Addictions, I mean I'm a Christian I became a Christian now. He's not shy about it. I'm a Christian. This is my identity John I was 18 my addictions didn't then stop, you know tempting me You know, and it's not just even the things that I that I had before I became a Christian I've had I've added new it new temptations as a believer. Trust me. They don't Love it on his pastor go away But rather than tapping into self-power or tapping into even good things like the accountability of a community and those kind of things now again watch he's setting up a hierarchy rather than Tapping into accountability community all of these things that are that are here. He's got a hierarchy in the hierarchy There's something bigger than that For me, it's in so inside out. I just have to continue to preach to myself What's a funny thing in contradiction to my new identity when I succumb to it? Okay, so there you have so the the technique here is there's an identity and Consistency with that identity and and this gets Peterson's interest I do succumb to it sometimes but when I do I have to tell myself I just acted in Contradiction to my new identity not as a compliment to my new identity. So so and Peterson's interested now and my biggest frustration with this entire talk was And this is always a temptation and I fall into it all the time and you can find me Doing it on lots of conversations. I can even tell you which ones I really regret when I should have listened Because you could see the person there you as a pastor now you've got them you've got them on the set You've got them on the trail. Don't don't don't interrupt their process As a Christian, I mean you're called upon ethically to act in a Christian manner. Yes, sir. And so there's obviously some assumption that your Voluntary actions are Part and parcel of an ethical requirement and also part and parcel of the faith but then there's also the the core correlated claim that the salvation is through Christ and so there's a there's a there's a there's a funny contradiction there that's difficult to Reconcile which is that on the one hand? It's the action of something Transcendent that's leading you out of perdition It's the action of God number two something transcendent and and so now now he's really got Peterson's interest because this is a big question for Peterson and it's a big question because of Metaphysics because the question God number two is You know, he's the Peterson is nicely established God number one in the need for God number one in terms of psychology but God number two who reaches out and and it's really interesting in the AA Conversation because what's the step? I am not in control of myself and I need to turn myself over to a Greater power a power greater than myself because my alcohol has made my life unmanageable see God number two is built into AA and It's not far from Peterson sitting on the side on the edge of his bed It's because you're sitting on the edge of your bed or you're you know There's been in your life has become a mess and you've gone to an a you're going to an AA meeting and someone's going to Say you need to turn your life over to a power greater than yourself Yeah, no wonder it's been a gateway drug to Christianity Because you're basically saying There's that Christian. There's that Christian moment and Peterson's like well There's this this this this Christian thing where is it is it me who stops drinking? Or is it this higher power that I turn my life over and that then leads me to sobriety but if I I I is it a psychological trick am I preaching to myself I Don't know there's a barrier there and we're gonna get over to Roger Scruton in a little while But before we get there, I want us to pause here about this movement and this trick and this turning because What's going on there? So let's let's leave these two And let's go to John Verbeke is His latest video that came out last Friday. I think it was number 13 He's talking about secularism and Buddhism, which is really helpful because Verbeke Again some of you are like, well, I don't want to listen to Verbeke because of the Buddhism stuff. Well, okay but Verbeke is understand his major project, which is that broadly in our society We are having a meaning crisis and this meaning crisis is because the axial age religions are no longer available Are no longer I would say justifiable To modern people and again all that stuff going on with this justifiable word Which we're really gonna go after it's no longer justifiable to believe in these axial age religions and it's no longer justifiable because Well, someone's gonna have to explain that to me at some point because I don't see it But it's no longer justifiable and so people are out there and that they're having this meaning crisis They're being sucked into nihilism and and and we need help and so what what John Verbeke's project is doing is saying can we via via cognitive science Justify see so this is what's so interesting about Verbeke's project because it's very similar to Peterson's project. They're they're Okay, metaphysics. Yeah, it's off the table. It got we're skeptical about that we we we we we close that door in the enlightenment and Sam Harris John Verbeke and Jordan Peterson in a sense. So say we all and Steven Pinker too So now we're gonna start with epistemology and we're gonna try and get up there we're gonna try and get to a place that now now Peterson in public just wants to save Western civilization and keep back the Bloody postmodern neo-marxists and The Christian the the private stuff about belief. Well, that's you know, that's that's that's the biblical series That's over here on the side. All right, he really wants to do it and he likes doing it and it's really cool But that's that's that's over here and you know if you if you can build his tower if you can get all the way up past the You know, you can get through that separation You really got something right that's the Tower of Abel John is is also a psychologist and John is saying well We got this meeting crisis and we ought to help people with this meeting crisis And so they're both kind of working on the same thing, but they're John isn't going anywhere near this political stuff and you know, I'm with John in that because You come to my meetup and you start using the meetup as a place to promote your politics people are gonna say No, we don't want to do that. We want to talk about Bigger stuff so so so John is is kind of part of this the group that is very popular in Sacramento kind of secular secular people who have found the wisdom of Buddhism helpful in terms of giving them more Of a life they want to live and that's that's John's project And and so John is is following some people like this. I've never heard of this guy I'm just learning about him through John's work Stefan or Steven bachelor After Buddhism and when I heard that I thought boy like this is I've heard a lot of this stuff in mainline Podcasts, you know including some stuff coming out of the the CBC Canada quite frankly does some really good stuff on their public television and radio and after theism was a was a CBC radio thing that I listened to it was very very interesting But that was a number of years ago. I think I've still got it probably on a hard drive someplace, but But and so now John is going to talk about back to where we started with this John is going to talk about beliefs and Buddhism is is Buddhism about About these beliefs that we have and John's gonna say no and I really like some of the moves that John makes as he's working through this. So let's uh, Let's let's let John do his thing now And So from his works and in discussion with him He argues that the West is still in the grip of a problematic way of trying to interpret Buddhism, so let's take a quick look at that and then we will return to what the central claims of Buddhism are and I want to show you why even that way of putting it is Perhaps perhaps incorrect. So bachelor in One of his books along with others and he follows it up with Buddhism without belief beliefs And then later on this is followed up by even a more radical after Buddhism in which he's taking the position of somebody who's post Religious very germane to many of us He but he does argue in alone with us very germane to many of us now Again, if you listen to Dallas Willard's very tough form Dallas is dead on right that little comment that John made its identity, okay, it's This is common to many of us, but this is these are the worldview shaping Sidebars that that very much deal with status You're not a flat-earther. Are you? You're not a Republican. Are you you didn't vote for Obama? Did you? You don't you don't listen to Jordan Peterson Do you and I'm not saying anything about that little statement that John made he didn't mean that there's nothing inappropriate about that statement, but remember we are Riders and elephants and we are as the elephants are always listening to these status things and To John's credit, I mean John has been very Interested in engaging with me and he said wonderful things about myself and Jonathan Peugeot and and even though we might have you know We might not agree on everything We're and this is very modern very Western. We want to produce we want to continue to Collaborate and work together towards truth and towards knowledge and towards learning from each other across these tribes that divide us and I'm totally with him. But again these little side comments are how we and This happens in churches all the time. I mean churches are are full of this stuff Well, you don't you know, it might be in a church that you don't you didn't vote for Obama Did you were you didn't vote for Trump? Did you I mean it's all these little status things that the elephants are always watching others that we face an interpretation crisis when we're Trying to understand Buddhism. We have two approaches that people give us for how we should try and interpret Buddhism, of course, this will not be relevant just to Buddhism But for any position that exists in a different Culture or history that we're trying to understand be a Buddhism or stoicism or Christianity too because what he's about to lay out I Was I forget the guy's name it was a it was one of the great series things on the Reformation you know is Christianity a statement of doctrines that we ascend to and say we believe in or is Christianity something else and It was popular about 15 20 years ago to say Christianity isn't a religion. It's a relationship and and that was a way of wanting to cut that Really telling Statement made by Christians in terms of what was going on in terms of status and belief systems Especially with respect to the skepticism surrounding metaphysics Okay, because well we can't agree on You know, we can't agree on what the Bible says or whether the Bible is true and publicly We keep the Bible over here in the private sphere. We don't let it into the public sphere We that's that's the secular move and this has been very important for America In fact, we've religion has flourished in America because of because of that move and that move has been very helpful and I frankly have never had a problem with there not being prayer in public schools because Why I'm not really so sure I want my teachers praying Because I have no idea who they are now if you're teaching at a Christian school the Christian school has you sign a statement and belief and they actually govern your beliefs and and And but but but again where we started this video Jordan Peterson and do you believe in God? I'm not so sure this whole belief talk has much validity That's essentially what he's saying. I Don't think he really believes that because I'm not sure he acts as if None of that belief talk has validity That's where I'm going with this because we have the identity talk with him and Nasser and now I think John Verbeke is gonna do a nice job of let's let's dig into this belief talk a little bit more and Should we throw this out and we'll get to some of that but We might find that we can't Really deal with each other without this belief talk. We might find that we threw out this belief talk because of our skepticism about metaphysics But we can't stop doing it We keep labeling each other's with these beliefs talk and we keep navigating our lives with This belief talk For example, so he says we are confronted with two different positions One is the claim that you can only interpret Buddhism from within a tradition And we've seen good reason why you might argue that that this is Wisdom and self-transcendence. This is not largely a matter of altering your belief This is about going through transformation in your perspectival and participatory knowing it's about fundamentally altering You're the agent arena relationship your existential modes, etc In other words, don't knock it till you've tried it and and Christians make this move all the time Because they say well, I well I've the Holy Spirit has changed me from the inside Therefore I have this degree of knowledge that you can't touch because I see it from the inside Okay You hear this at the the hoax guys the hoax paper guys have noted this in terms of Some critical theory talk that well, you know White guy you don't really know what racism is because you don't know what it's like to be black or man You don't know what woman is because you don't know what it's like to be a woman. It's this it's this you know, you Don't criticize Buddhism unless you've been a Buddhist Don't criticize Christianity unless you've been a Christian and been renewed by the Holy Spirit And so if you are not engaged within the transformative practice, then of course you do not understand What what Buddhism is it has to in that sense be understood from within and this is a general property of wisdom per se Wisdom is something that must be understood from within The problem with that of course is the it's my opaque right there are very many Buddhist traditions and they are Relative to certain times and place in particular historical contexts Now now what he's noting here with Buddhism as with Christianity is there's a pluralism problem that You know, so not only is that true of Buddhism in general, but unless you're a reformed Christian You don't really understand the beauty of tulip unless you're a Pentecostal, you don't really understand the the beauty of the of the second blessing and And so you there's a knowledge problem in this that there's kind of a gnostic knowledge problem in this And to claim that that particular interpretation a particular sect or tradition is the sole pathway to understanding or interpreting Buddhism and this rates against this this irritates our democratic values that you know, one of the things that that that you know Democratic it should be everything should be accessible to all okay, and so We're suspicious about this this private knowledge Is of course myopic it's narrow-minded and often parochial it claims things as fundamental which are often very contingent so What's the alternative the alternative? Is well what the alternative says is the problem with this is this is very subjective I don't know if that's exactly the right word But the idea here is right This is the problem with seeing things from the inside is that tends to be very subjective And of course that means you're not understanding the phenomenon as is but you're only seeing it through your own particular bias So The alternative Outside any tradition and this is typified in the academic study of Buddhism For example like within religious studies or something like that and then the main argument here is and this will often happen It's not always the case But if you meet people in religious studies and you'll say are you studying Buddhism and they'll say yes Yes, I'm studying Buddhism and then and then you'll ask them. Well, what practices do you engage in? They'll say oh, no. No, I don't engage in any practices. That would be a mistake If I got it too involved too close to this material, I would lose my objectivity I would lose my ability to critically reflect on it. I have to maintain my Monarchical vision of this I have to see it all from a distance, but I have to be Unmoved and unmovable by it and that then affords this this other kind of knowledge Well, what's that other kind of knowledge? Critically compare it to other traditions other approaches So the idea here is what we will have right is an objective account Now although Stephen doesn't mention this in his book bachelor this Stephen bachelor doesn't mention in his book This is very reminiscent of the problem that Socrates faced Because what we have here is transformative relevance And here we have some attempt to get at the truth and Like the Socratic project I would put it to you and this is what I think bachelor is saying is That Buddhism is about both of these it's about trying to find transformative Lee relevant truths Something hasn't split yet But that means we have to transcend both of These ways of interpreting Buddhism So we have to transcend it we have to transcend something that in many ways Wasn't divided but has been divided and this is this is a common thing throughout history Which we're gonna get into a little bit when we start mentioning the name of Owen Barfield. He points out that We have to get beyond both of these in some fashion That's gonna be hard we do this well He points out that we need to do this in a way that is going to be relevant to issues of meaning in our life so this interpretation crisis where we have these two competing and diametrically opposed ways of trying to interpret and import Buddhism is Actually interacting with the meaning crisis in society Because we're not doing this just in some empty cultural vacuum We are precisely interested as I've been suggesting throughout this series of lectures Where that we're doing this precisely because we're deeply involved with the project of trying to recover How we can cultivate wisdom and enhance meaning in our lives in a cultural historical context that is not supportive And is fact often deleterious to those existentially necessary endeavors Right there this dual thing how it connects with the meaning crisis connects up with Jordan Peterson's coyness about The answer about his belief in God you've got the subjective That's private. You've got the objective. Well, I'm gonna stay over there with respect to truth But the integration is obviously what you need to address meaning and so Peterson Well, this is again been the standard the naked public square has been the standard posture of the West since the Great American experiment of secularity at least with respect to the federal government and then the states followed and And again, I'm not criticizing freedom of religion here So don't you know don't think I'm a theonomist most of you don't know what that name is so don't worry about it But I'm not a theonomist These two are split and in a sense the game we started playing was that well, there's there's public truth and so That's what I'm gonna be in public scientific objective and then there's subjective private Experience of religion and so Jordan Peterson when asked well, do you believe in God? might have just asked him about you know other private things like how much money he's making or sex life with his wife or Whether you know, we know he doesn't drink himself to sleep at night because he can't drink alcohol As he's only eating beef and water I should laugh Right But there were not that split there and and and and and verveky is dead on right The meaning crisis is revolving around this So now Stephen bachelor is gonna want to address this by dealing with this question of belief Okay, so what do we do we have to break out of all of this in some fashion and what he does is he tries to See where these are both fixated And what he argues is that This will become myopic Because it will get fixated on the particular propositions of a tradition. It will get fixated on Beliefs and this is in fact what you study over here Objectively you study of course the texts and the beliefs that have been Propositionally rendered by a particular tradition so in other words they both What happens? Okay, so you got your Pentecostals and your foreign people and and well you you reform people really don't know what the second blessing Is like and and and the and the reform people say the Pentecostals you really don't know what the assurance of salvation built on a solid foundation Is like and then of course the vineyard and John Wimber folks can we can say you can be both come on You can be reformed Pentecostal But we're not gonna go into the second blessing thing will be charismatic not on and on and on and on and on so And what you find is that they start arguing about beliefs they start arguing about their doctrine and their dogma and of course America has had plenty of experience with this and Hasn't doesn't really like all the conflict and so I'm not gonna go there and plus you have the fact that your metaphysics Which for the Christians is the foundational layer where we started out this video with Paul Maxwell We're skeptical about that and so we're All of this religious dogma as we saw all the fights between the confessional tribes and the breaking away of the Protestant Reformation none of that led to anything and so I'm just gonna stick over here with my subjective experience And I'm gonna leave truth over there But what access does do the objectivist have with respect to the subjectivist Well, it's their beliefs because that's what they're always fighting about And so that must really be what these religions are about. They're all about the beliefs It's this belief fixation That needs to be broken through this is why he entitles the book that came after along with others Buddhism without beliefs because he tries to argue that Part of what is preventing us from really getting both sides of Buddhism is that both of these are Fixed locked like being locked inside the box in the nine dot problem. I'm trying to understand Buddhism as a set of beliefs Now this of course was moved on before with the whole spiritual but not religious movement because well we can get away from beliefs We if we just focus it on Schleiermacher this this this experience of dependence if we can if we can make it completely Subjective we can get away from beliefs and you know a lot went into the New Age movement in Towards this but you just keep bumping into beliefs and they keep coming up and because beliefs are a very Easy way to begin to frame all of this stuff and and right there when we start Let's say making the identity move. Well, there they are. There they are We have gotten so used to this way of thinking and we'll see later why it is a post-christian way of thinking that These traditions for culture these axial legacy traditions for cultivating wisdom and self-transcendence are to be understood as creeds as Systems of beliefs that we now even will equate right The word belief with these practice will talk about it as a belief system or will you even use the word belief as a synonym for? faith Etc. So we have gotten so oriented towards this reduction of All of what we've been talking about here all of this transformation process to the possession and the assertion of beliefs and again We'll see historically why that's the case that we Can't break out of this interestingly Although I won't be able to do it in this Video we're going to see that breaking out of Right trying to understand meaning in terms of belief systems is also going to be needed to address the meaning crisis Now here's the thing you're gonna deal with when you're dealing with these beliefs You're gonna bump into metaphysical claims It's gonna happen and That's part of the point of this video now Looking at the clock and I'm looking at the time and I'm thinking I'm gonna have to break this up into two videos and I always hate doing that but I'm going to have to because I just don't have time to sit here and do this and If I just stop the video and have one Monstrous three or four hour video that's probably not gonna work So I am gonna have to break this up because when I'm thinking about all the other stuff I want to bring in here It's all in there. But this this is where Vervecky and Maxwell I'm putting together because These that what we're what we're doing is being haunted by metaphysics in that at some point you can't help but make metaphysical claims or Smuggle them in or rely on metaphysical assertions we're we're not going to get away from that and That's where all of this goes I have been Pointing you towards that repeatedly belief systems namely ideologies are attempts to create meaning but they fail for The deep reason and you've already seen a lot of argument and evidence for this is that a lot of your meaning-making Machinery is not occurring at the level of your propositional knowledge your your beliefs And and your assertions of which beliefs you adhere to Now right there I'm gonna play that again because it's really important and at some point when John and I talked It's proud. This is probably where our conversation is going to go Or occurring at the level is is that a lot of your meaning-making? Machinery is not occurring at the level of your propositional knowledge your your Beliefs and or and your assertions of which beliefs you adhere to That gets into the disconnect that Peterson notes that you act out your true beliefs instead of The beliefs that you are and there's cognitive reasons for that and that's that this this is our This is our separation from ourselves So this is what Paul talks about in Romans 7 the good I would do I don't do and and what I don't want to do I do and I need Well, he's gonna assert I need Rescue the alcoholic makes this move that the good I would do I I don't do and and and the stuff I want to do I I can't stop but doing and and so something something needs to happen and and and it's There are reasons why we're in this mess We're in with respect to well, I believe I'm you know whether it's a Someone trying to get sober whether it's a Christian trying to live by their moral system and and you know Of course where Peterson and and and Nasser ended or where I ended them was was right there were Peterson's Well, what what what is it? Is it is it this God right away? God number two this real God this this this Interventionist that comes and and delivers the alcoholic from the thing greater than themselves that they need to be delivered from What what is it? Can you get there is there something there I mean this of course is the big question now Let's see I'm at 1336 Maybe this is a good place to leave a cliffhanger new thing for me Because I'm running out of time and It's just the way schedules go and these videos go sometimes so I'm thinking about I've got Tim Keller lined up. I've got Kevin de Young lined up and I'm gonna bring in I'm gonna bring in Maxwell to finish his video and I've got Roger Scruton lined up in Cambridge University lined up I got all this stuff to do and I just can't get it done in an hour So I'm gonna pause right here because I really want to have I Think it's really helpful what verveky is doing and the language he's giving to and I really like what he does with the first noble truth and Well, what is that suffering and Then we're gonna have to bring in Owen Barfield So NCS Lewis comes in too. So yeah, I'm gonna pause it here. This is a good place to stop. So I'll probably post this this afternoon after it's done rendering and There's a cliffhanger
