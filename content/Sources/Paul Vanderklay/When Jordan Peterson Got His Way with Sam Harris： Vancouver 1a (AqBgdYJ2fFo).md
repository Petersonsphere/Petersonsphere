 Hi, this is Paul and I didn't want to let a day go by without doing a video I did not I don't have a PowerPoint plan which might mean I ramble worse than many days Which maybe will make some of the saner saner of you want to shut off the video right now but I'm just gonna plunge into Vancouver one as I call it and What comes before this are the in the applause and Brett Weinstein talking a little bit and Sam Harris both of them were just kind of making introductory comments and Jordan Peterson has no introductory comments to make he wants to jump right into it. So here we go All right So I'm gonna jump right into it. I think you're so look this is I Don't know what that little cut was I hadn't noticed that before this is I've listened to the audio and a lot I haven't actually watched the video much At all, so I might see some things as I watch the video now So in a sense, I've listened to their arguments quite a bit now, but it's the first time watching them And I didn't notice that little cut before But again as I said in my last video what Peterson's going to do now I'm gonna I'm gonna take this up until the Jane Goodall Peterson goes down the Jane Goodall Road and at that point in Vancouver one here things really run off the rails But in this whole first section between when Peterson says I'm gonna jump right in now and when he gets to Jane Goodall He is building his railroad He is constructing his tower of blocks and Sam Harris starts poking a little bit But Jordan Peterson isn't gonna take the bait on any of these things and he's gonna keep building his argument And there's a lot of good stuff that comes up in here and Brett Weinstein has a lot of good things to say in here So let's listen I put up a poll a couple of days ago to find out what people Broadly speaking might want us to discuss and I've been taking a look at that and I took a lot of notes Which is why I have my computer here, by the way and my phone. It's not to check my email. Well the debates going on The discussion I thought what I might do is just lay out some places that I think Sam and I agree And because there's lots of places we agree and so and then I want to figure out Where we disagree which I've been trying to sort out and then I want to see if we can hash it out a little bit And and move forward on that a bit. So I'm gonna so Peterson takes the initiative here. Peterson has the plan He's got a plan in his mind and Peterson is really driving you know, I've been trying to think of a Metaphor to to figure out this is a nice This is this first part is a nice stroll through the I'm thinking about the Hobbit But I'm gonna put Sam in the Hobbit and of course those of you who are Tolkien fans know Sam is in Lord of the Rings Sam isn't in the Hobbit. So there's little Sam Harris Sam Gamgee thing I'm working in my mind but but Jordan Peterson is going to they're gonna be they're gonna be on be your own ponies heading to Mirkwood and Once we hit Jane Goodall and the apes we're gonna descend into Mirkwood and then we're gonna hit all kinds of All Kinds of mess in Vancouver one, but here we go layout See one of the things that Carl Rogers said this like Psychologist was that one of the good way to have a discussion with someone is to tell them what you think they think Until they think that what you said reflects what they said Now they're gonna practice this a number of times and last night I was actually just listening to the the Dublin the Dublin recording and They they started that and I think there is some practical utility to that method I don't know that that method necessarily solves a lot I've seen that method used in marriage counseling and it generally is Helpful, but it isn't necessarily going to get us beyond our impasses here Like this is a really useful thing to know if you're ever having a discussion with an intimate partner For example is that you have to put their argument back to them in terms they agree with it's very difficult so I'm gonna try to do that and so so the first thing is I think I think that partly what's driving you if this is accurate is that you want to ground a structure of ethics in something solid and and and there's two There's two things you want to avoid two catastrophes Let's say one is the catastrophe that you identified with religious fundamentalism and the other is the catastrophe that's associated with moral relativism Is that is that reasonable? Yeah, that's good. Okay, good good Hey agreement number one religious fundamentalism Fundamentalism that could very what very well show up in a words that fudge video. So religious fundamentalism and Let's let it Peterson continue. Okay. Well, no, but this Okay, so it's crucially it's crucially important that we get this right now He's setting up the blocks Peterson has a project in mind and he is Moving down. He is he is heading down the road and that's something that I think we really agree on because I've conceptualized that slightly different than you and that might be relevant But I think of that as a pathology of order and a pathology of chaos So the terminology is slightly different, but I think we're working on the same axis. So so So Is I guess the arbitrarious chaos and the fundamentalism a little bit later the fundamentalism as in? Secular fundamentalism in the Soviet Union and in China and religious fundamentalism their order. I can see that So that's the first thing and then in order to do that. It seems to me That's your first priority And then maybe your second priority is something like, you know, you see undo suffering in the world plenty of it and you would think that things would be better if that wasn't the case and that this Morality, whatever it's going to be is at least going to part ground itself in part on the presupposition That the less undue suffering in the world the better so so the first priority is avoiding arbitrary dogmas and See this is where Peterson's chaos order doesn't quite map on to Sam Harris's but I understand where Peterson's going. It's interesting that The first priority he sees Sam's first priority now. Remember these are priorities. So one is over the other They're in a hierarchy. The first priority is that things be grounded in The world, okay And obviously they're going to spend almost all of their time talking about how things can be grounded in the world because of course Sam is going to want to say these are grounded in facts and then they're going to delve into deep conversations basically about what is a fact because Harris wants to keep saying fact fact fact and Jordan keeps seeing Harris point to things that Jordan says that's not really a fact. That's that's something else than a fact Something else than a fact you've you've added something there and are calling it a fact so we'll get there Is that is that also reasonable? Yeah, I would just add to that the the positive side of the continuum as well So what as you know, the phrase I use the word I use for this is well-being. Yeah, and I know From having I don't think we spoke about this on my podcast But from having seen you in other interviews, I think you think that phrase doesn't capture everything One could reasonably want Uh, but I think it does. I mean I've just I've you know, it's it's an elastic suitcase term for reason and it's Okay right there Well-being Is an elastic suitcase term for reason now if you listen to this This is the happy time again until we get into murkwood If you listen to this carefully what what sam harris actually does at many times with these little comments he divides he defines his terms so Well-being and reason are the same thing which is a very interesting Association Because he's going to also want to say that reason yields well-being But here he says reason is well-being and what you're going if you listen to him very carefully in terms of how he uses this word reason Reason now peterson later will accuse of him using reason as a black box I I would use I would say he uses reason more as a black velvet cloth and he covers. Okay. Well-being There's an elastic suitcase. Let's call that reason this process that will yield well-being. Let's call that reason Let's see how many different kinds of reason we can find with sam harris It's actually in reading your book I realize there's a point of contact here because you use the word bean capital b bean with As though it were imbued with significant gravitas and and Well again being with capital b Peterson is is is kind of pointing to to heidegger and Okay, sam your point so for me and I agree with you that's an appropriate use of bean and For me well-being is simply just the positive side of being you know There's the negative side the suffering we want to mitigate but I think I think however good Consciousness can be in this universe that Well-being for me subsumes all of those possibilities Okay. Now now there's something a little interesting and actually brett weinstein will bring this up a little bit later in that Sam harris with his well-being has a time problem now Again, if you listen to my past videos about a monarchical vision Well, what is a monarchical vision? monarchical vision is Is kind of like your grandma's parlor. No, maybe the dutch will probably get this For for a lot of dutch immigrants this probably goes back to the netherlands. There's this one room in your house it's the best room and as a kid you can never go in there to play and You wonder what this room is for and then some High status person comes into your home and they get to sit in this room, but that room is That room is in a sense timeless. Okay and and so a big Problem with sam harris's. Okay, so Well-being is reason or reason leads to well-being a big problem with sam harris's scheme here Is that you've got the question of time? and As I wanted to do a video before this one, but I haven't had time to work out the powerpoint So i'm just i'm just ad-libbing this one A great example is the the daughter who comes home With the motorcycle gang member and says i'm in love. He makes me happy now the I didn't mean to slur the motorcycle gang members, but Your child comes home with a romantic interest that you look at And say This is a disaster now. You may be right or you may be wrong because sometimes they do work out but in that moment the daughter sees her well-being very clearly and and this is part of the problem with sam harris's scheme because I think this Imagining the world as a place of objects is kind of like that dutch parlor Where this room that's never touched it sits outside of time and all the objects are there Well time is a very big deal and and what works for me right now And they'll get into this a little bit when they talk about cocaine what works for me right now What makes me deliriously happy? Might not work for me tomorrow and peterson talks about the simpsons where You know homer homer is drinking and his wife says well, you shouldn't be doing that drinking and well, that's that's future that's for future homer to worry about and and this is part of the this is part of the Upgrade that understanding the world as a realm for action a forum for action is Over a monarchical vision of a static world because We do live in time and the world is not static and this and this gets into Some of the some of the things that clump in terms of this monarchical vision and a timeless world These are these are all moments But and science is very is very capable of looking at moments and looking at certain processes And so sam harris is going to say well reason is basically our capacity to control these processes To deliver on good outcomes to deliver on this this well-being Which is a which is a fairly static thing that's imagining this well-being and Well, the problem you're going to have is time in that this chocolate cake might seem very much within my well-being now but Eating this chocolate cake every night for the next 20 years is going to cause real problems for my well-being and you can say well reason Can help tell us that but there are many things in this world that we Don't know and in it was either maps of meaning or personalities where jordan peterson talks about the car Which I think is a tremendous example because we look at a car and you say well a car is an object in space And peterson says no car is way way more than that a car is an incredibly efficient processing device that transforms fossil fuel into Carbon dioxide and a byproduct of that transformation is movement And so you could imagine that if it were our goal to transform fossil fuels into carbon dioxide the internal combustion engine would be just a very effective way of doing this and We just had the collateral effect of us wanting to get places and that is doing it or a car is the way that we transform all of our urban areas or a car is a way that 30,000 people die on highways every year and we don't think anything of it or a cars and and that's where you get into the problem of Well-being is not a simple thing Now I was just having a conversation with someone and I was talking about The way we often and again peterson talks about this too the way we often reduce poverty to a function of money But you can go to the best neighborhoods of sacramento and see people living impoverished lives where they have no reason for material want Think about howard hughes dying naked with his jars full of his own urine Howard hughes died poor, although he had plenty of money In other words, well-being is a very difficult thing and what you're going to hear sam harris say over and over again Is that whenever jordan peter says something like that sam harris is going to say well my well-being encompasses that my well-being encompasses that and when I listen to this it reminds me of when I used to play games with my sisters and You know you might be across the table and you're shooting at each other And one person gets the bright idea to say I have a bulletproof shield And then the other person gets the idea of thinking okay, they have a bulletproof shield I'm going to start shooting bombs and then the other person says I have a bomb proof shield and then the other person starts thinking about what's bigger than a bomb and then The other person says I have an everything shield and and sam harris again and again Defaults to this everything shield my well-being includes everything now Sam harris might rightly say to christians. Well, that's kind of what your god is And yeah, that's sort of true but that's part of the What goes into let's say if you someone mentioned to me the other day Jordan peterson's first biblical series pay attention that it's it's entitled the idea of god that You have this idea now again if we say obviously as a christian I say god is more than an idea But if god is at least an idea god number one in my god number one and god number two If god is if it's at least an idea You want an idea that takes care of everything? And when we devise fictions, we we do it all the time now sam harris has Stories make him itch It seems and we're gonna spend a lot of time talking about stories But sam harris in a sense and jordan peterson keeps tagging him on this concocts a story where he says well This is an well-being is an everything term. It's this elastic suitcase that is Is reason And again, it's like wait a minute reason now. I would I would better understand you if you'd say reason is a tool by which we take We colonize things in this world that we are able to in order to Bring ourselves into this place of well-being. I can understand that but I don't understand well-being as reason Okay. Well, so I so I focused on the suffering element I think as i've done in my own work because I actually think it's easier to zero in on in some sense Like I think it's easier for people and I think you lay out the argument in the moral landscape kind of like this I think it's easier perhaps to gain initial agreement between people on what might constitute a generalized ethic To concentrate on what we don't want. Yeah, i'm not saying that what we do want is unimportant But it seems to me to be harder to get a grip on we don't want oschwitz We don't want to go like archipelago So and and there are and those and I would add to just closing the door to moral relativism here Those who do want oschwitz are wrong to want oschwitz. I mean, it's obviously what's only happened because some people did want oschwitz Not the victim side but the perpetrator side And this gets into some of the trickiness of well-being too because obviously in the minds of of some oschwitz was a reasonable tool to appropriate And wield in pursuit of their well-being now if you go back again to peterson and his piaget A equilibrated game this has to if if if well-being is working for some people but not for other people Well, then it's not full well-being it's not the elastic suitcase there where you have everything But again You have the problem and this is going to be with all of sam harris's stuff Who decides well-being? So let's say the Now maybe i'm you know, i'm in my mid-50s now and my kids are now coming into their 20s And so my mind turns to the thought of grandchildren much to my children's dismay So so I think ah, I have grandchildren to look forward to I loved children. I'm really excited about grandchildren But there are no grandchildren on the on the horizon right now and none of my children are married So I really like there to be no grandchildren yet. I want my grandchildren to to land in a home that is ready for them But Here's what we have with human beings. We have conflicting desires now. I don't think my desire for grandchildren Is religious. I think it's probably more biological than than anything else, but my children might say Having children is not in my view of well-being The world is just full of Conflict over Well-being in in fact set aside all the religious stuff Imagine a space however you define religion now i'm doing a sam harris type thing Imagine your your your your non-religious your non-religious utopia You're going to get rid of conflict because so you've got well-being and one of the things that sam Never addresses that I heard in any of this is the relationship between well-being and desire even though Someone might very well say well the definition of well-being is desires fulfilled So are we all going to desire the same thing Are we all going to desire the same thing do we all desire the same thing for ourselves as others? In a world of limited resources Is it the case that me having more means you having less? And what if I want more? What if there isn't enough to go around and later peterson will will go into this that Throughout most of human history resources were scarce hard decisions had to be made And Reason was often applied to it but again once you employ reason now suddenly you have your hierarchy of values stacking up and you might say we're going to send this child to college and not these other two kids because Because why because this child is a man? And women don't won't have the same economic potential because this child got better grades in earlier school Because this child is my favorite again immediately got a hierarchy values coming up and Then reason is employed but reason is not well being there reason is Read jonathan. Hey height reason is so often now i've been listening to note and network and the um The ian mcgrill chris stuff reason is often the left brain jumping in to make up a reason For the right brain to get what it wants So what is the relationship between well-being and desire? And so crucially for me is the claim that I'm a realist i'm a moral realist and what realism means is that it's that there are right and wrong answers to questions of this kind Okay, so in past videos i've talked and we're going to go back again to dallas willard And actually in one of my meetups. I mentioned moral knowledge So there is according to both sam harris and jordan peterson here A moral structure in the universe that has that that is a real thing now It's very interesting if we back this up What kind of thing is that does it exist does it exist does that moral knowledge exist Like santa claus does that moral knowledge exist like Water being hydrogen and oxygen Does that moral knowledge exist like math? Where does that moral knowledge come from? Does it come from i think sam harris would say it it comes from physics and now peterson is going to say Well, this is peterson it's it's it's okay It's it's built up by us watching each other but towards what end what is the telos and again? This is another thing that is stalking these conversations that they they really can't get into Which is what what is what is the? Which is what what is What is the what is the end here? And so okay. Well, the end is well-being. Well, who's well-being? Well well-being for everyone. Okay. Can you be more specific? Because yeah, it's an elastic suitcase and you equated it with reason but can you be more specific? And and you cannot know what you're missing in fact, we almost certainly don't know what we're missing on Questions of human value and then and our job is to discover Don't know what we're missing on questions of human value Say one of the things that you really have to we have to work hard And when we listen to these is figuring out now, what do both of these men mean by value? And I think implicit in this idea of value is in fact again jordan peterson's hierarchy to value something makes it More or less valuable than another thing is to set it up in a hierarchy the Elvis's guitar is more valuable than elton john's glass Just how good life can be and just what variables are making it needlessly horrible and And okay just how good life can be but again, we're we're treating things in a very abstract way here. So Right now I can go to how many places in sacramento and find people who are in nursing homes? Waiting for death in dementia in pain in misery and well Bring them your reason well-being suitcase Life is about to end for them What you're gonna hurry them along the way isn't that what's reasonable if But again, once you get to that point you have to say well hurrying them along the way doctor assisted suicide is reasonable if Then you're making some presumptions about what even sam harris and harris admits He can't know because it's not accessible to other faculties for reason to To mitigate all of that and live in a in a better and better world. Okay. Well, so, okay, so And peterson here again, he's not going to get tripped up on the little things. Okay. He's working his project forward Okay, so so that's a that's a that's a lot of points of agreement so I also believe that there is a catastrophe of of arbitrary Moral injunction and that there's a catastrophe of moral relativism and that Arbitrary moral injunction and moral relativism. So relativism Relativism then is kind of the opposite of moral realism. And again, I would love I would love to hear sam harris talk about how he's using that word there What what is real about morality? in terms of the world conceived as a place of objects is morality an object Is it when you say there is no god? The denial of ontology there based on what premises is being applied now to the ontology of morality That that has to be dealt with and that there are genuine differences between The proper way of behaving morally and and and the improper way of behaving morally And I think that they are grounded in the proper way of behaving morally and the improper way of behaving morally We're getting deep human universals, even though there's a wide amount of variation So that that's a lot of points of agreement, right? So we know that what neither and and this will stalk both of them throughout the whole thing. Okay, so I'd love to hear both of them Get more specific on their good now because I think stalking petersons will be his darwinian understanding of truth that Morality means that which Causes human beings to continue to survive Okay I really have no idea the telos for sam harris beyond I think this perhaps is this this timeless stasis Of well-being in a moment that you know is is there with his idea of consciousness Okay And a good time was had by all when In what moment? Well in this moment all that matters is this moment? Okay But what we're doing you go back to jordan peterson with his delayed gratification how this kind of almost becomes the the development of god in jordan peterson's scheme Again in jordan peterson's scheme time is factored in in a much more appropriate way because delayed gratification Is is almost the opposite of Well, I want this moment to be my best moment now. So I will eat the chocolate cake Delayed gratification says i'm not going to eat the chocolate cake instead. I'm going to go to the gym and Because I am hoping that if I take care of my body now I will be able to live in my 70s and 80s in a much more fruitful way, okay, so less well-being now More well-being later. But again sam harris's scheme Is this kind of timeless stasis in which well-being is in a moment? outside of time without time And and again a little bit later jordan peterson's going to tag him and say you've kind of set up heaven and hell here But there's two things we want to avoid we Conceptually speaking which is the moral relativism and this kind of moral absolutism that's grounded in in an arbitrary Statement of facts that you identify with religious fundamentalism I would identify that with fundamental fundamentalism more generally not not with religious fundamentalism per se because I see it also happening Happening in secular states, let's say like nazi germany or or or And so to try to figure out what peterson means by fundamentalism there I I think It's not far from sam harris's in a a too rigid Attachment to certain ideas or rules or beliefs That and then that what that Doesn't help us move towards our goal and you can see right there again. This question of goals Is stalking this conversation and not addressed and so sam harris says no my goal is well-being Okay, who's well-being everyone's well-being? All time even for the person Lying in their adult diaper in the nursing home in pain right now No, I have no hope for them. So well-being for them is doctor assisted suicide. That's reasonable But it's only reasonable within a frame of telos and outcomes Because in a sense there and this is where there's all these implicit things well Well, we're not going to be able to do that Well Well, lack of pain is better than pain Except if you're on the treadmill at the gym because you're trying to bank You're you're bringing pain to your body so that you will have less pain later. Yeah, but that's what reason gives you Okay, but there's a telos there. There's a story there There's a progression there that gets you from a to b and in this static stasis like Room dutch parlor that sam harris is setting up here There's no accounting for that and and that's why he keeps having to step out of the room and in a sense cheat or just Hand-wave as they say To to make it work So it doesn't seem to be religious fundamentalism per se that's crucial to your argument. No, it's not This is a big deal in here. I'll back it up a little bit just to religious fundamental states Let's say like Nazi Germany or So it doesn't seem to be religious fundamentalism per se that's crucial to your argument. No, it's not I would say so that just to close the loop on that The only reason why I would focus on religion in particular. There is that religion is the only language game wherein fundamentalism and dogmatism Now pay attention. You just find religion as a language game, which is very interesting And what dogmatism is not a pejorative concept the dogma is a good Religion is the only language game where dogmatism is not a pejorative concept Someone someone tweeted me and said dogmatism is probably gonna have to make a appearance in your words that fudge Videos because well, what exactly is a dogmatism? It's always better than fill in the blank there's a dogmatism You're gonna hold to that reason is always better than arbitrary supernatural assumptions Is that a dogmatism? Might Sam Harris find further evidence? Does he have sufficient evidence? Because later he's going to define dogmatism as that which we hold with insufficient evidence Insufficient evidence for whom? Person over here has had some ecstatic Experience of the supernatural person over here has had none Does that ecstatic experience of the supernatural? qualify as evidence Evidence towards what and now we're back into the question of subjectivity evidence for me not evidence for you What we're gonna try and do with science is get to a lowest common denominator Get to a lowest common denominator and in a sense what they usually the move they usually make with that is to say well The super the the experience we will call the experience something here and we'll use that to compare Well, that's interesting Because people don't work that way with experiences at all One person one person hasn't hasn't been eating and they finally get a job and they go to this job and they're out there picking strawberries and they've snuck across the border and they're they're working long hours in the hot sun picking strawberries because they're earning dollars and They're happy as a clam to do it. They have sacrificed and risked greatly Whereas the vast majority of eaters of those strawberries will not be caught dead in that field And if you brought them out to that field, they would immediately complain about the hot sun and everything. So, okay Who's experience? On what level do you Do you quality do you compare these experiences and this is this is again part of? Why science manages certain things well? Science and technology but other things it just doesn't handle well at all most notably people word in specifically within Catholicism and The notion that you must believe things on faith that is in the absence of compelling Evidence that would otherwise cause a rational person to believe it. Okay there he just defined faith for us that that is in the Catholicism and The notion that you must believe things on faith that so so faith is that which We don't have compelling evidence for in the light of contradictory evidence that a rational person Okay, there's that word again now pay attention to When he takes rationally puts it together with people a little bit later He's gonna complain about he's gonna complain about religion that would take Normally good people and make them go off into Syria and fight for Isis back when that was happening So so what is a rational person? What is a good person? I thought rational and well-being were kind of the same thing but now rational is is a rational person a well-being person or is a rational person someone who can see and I would argue a rational person is someone who can start with the ground and Build up a chain of logic to get to an anticipated outcome Now we do this all the time But the word universe is very complex and often we don't get to our outcomes That is in the absence of compelling out evidence that would otherwise cause a rational person to believe it that You know religious context is considered a feature not a bug elsewhere We recognize it to be a bug and that's that's why the the okay So we have this imagined reason we have this imagined religious context here where Reason is a bug because you're taking things on insufficient evidence And you've got this other context over here where or where this is a feature or where this is a bug What's interesting and again, this is the video I wanted to make before this because I wanted to make a point about Religious people even in deeply religious context. They use reason just like everyone else They just begin with different premises And this is one thing that Sam Harris knows because if you believe that this book is a certain thing then Reason leads you to other things now if the book is a Bible reason might lead you to Certain behaviors if the book is a medical book or a first and aid manual Reason may lead you to other things again Reason isn't founding the book reason is dictating behavior in In Alignment with the premises and again Ian McGoquist in that video I played a while ago Makes that quite clear about exactly what reason is reason helps us understand consistency So the book here says that drinking water out of a drainage ditch could be bad for your health Well, I'm gonna drink it. Well, that's irrational Why Because you have not followed the premise and you've not followed through That's what reason does and this is in fact the entire argument what they're involved in here Okay, so so so so it alright So is it reasonable to assume that the associate we've already established at least in principle that there's an association between the totalitarian regimes, let's say and dog and dogmatism and the dogmatism that characterizes religious belief What do you think although at least in principle the the secularist totalitarian states and the religious fundamentalist totalitarian states do differ in one important regard Which is that the religious types ground their axioms in God and the secular totalitarian types don't and so there's got to be something about totalitarianism and I would love for them to have a conversation about what he means by God there because So religious group will say God is this therefore by reason this a totalitarian group will say they won't use the word God but they'll use the universe or the natural order or nature if you look at if you look at what an interesting thing to look at is that both usually the two subjects that come up here are Nazism and Marxism Marxism is a bears with it an assumption about a Progression of What a a social progression an economic progression and all kinds of things are built into that Nazism assumed that what the universe really is is a story of racial progression Religions have other stories within them now What's interesting about let's say Marx's Idea is that Marx didn't appeal to a holy book but looked at? history His take on history and said ah, here's a pattern boom Nazis looked at history and said ah, here's a pattern boom What do religious people usually do for whom? Maybe a God doesn't show up or a God is hidden. They say aha. Here's a pattern I'm working on a sermon on the prophet Nahum That is a book that most of you have probably not read it is in the Bible it is a very short little book and it talks about the destruction of Nineveh and Well, how if you were an ancient Near East potentate Would you try to fear? Would you try to figure out who are the wise men and who are the bad wise men? Well, it's pretty simple you take down you write down Everything that these imagined wise men these imagined prophets these imagined Soosayers would say and then you keep them you keep the writing not in a file cabinet Maybe on little little little things of clay where they often kept notes You keep them and you remember them in your head and you mark out which Profits get it, right? So what are you doing? You're looking at a pattern and you're saying in fact, we do this all the time because Was it Nate Silver who predicted Obama's election? I mean after that after the 2008 election everyone's looking at his His page about sports and politics and everything he thought You know Hillary was the favorite to win. She lost suddenly Nate Silver isn't on the news anymore. Why well, it's exactly the same thing now, obviously Let's take a step out of the Bible to some of the losers of Near Eastern religion let's look at Marduk and the Babylonians or or the or the Assyrians and Ishtar of the Assyrians and Well, how did they what was their science and technology about religion? They looked for patterns They tried to discern them in order to forecast the future and now Sam Harris would say well, that was bad outdated technology We do better Okay Predict the stock market. I don't think you'd be up here talking to Jordan Peterson if you could do that If you could do that, well, what does that mean about reason reason reason? Is being used all along the way or say that's independent of That's associated with religious belief in the manner that you just described but that's not particularly associated with the belief in God There's something that makes them that's a commonality between them. And so do you have any sense of what that might be? well, I would I Think I'll know both give some Both give these guys that they're sitting on stage This is a very hard thing that they're doing most of us couldn't do it anywhere Near as well as either of these guys can do it when you get an asked a hard question And you've got a whole audience in front of you. You've got TV cameras in front of you Well, let's think about what the brain does Well the brain you've got the right side of the brain that says don't want to lose status I don't want to lose status. Yes, the hard question. I haven't a lot of time to think about it What does the left side of the brain do up up up up? Here's an answer again, look at the split brain look at the split brain studies and The brain just gives answers. Well Are these answers connected to anything? Maybe maybe not Because the brains just given them and so here you go, Sam One has to acknowledge that there's something uniquely pernicious at least Potentially about religious beliefs because that's a lot of qualifiers they have the otherworldly variable the supernatural variable the so let me get this straight if Your goal is well-being here and you're going to take away everyone's religion because We have insufficient evidence to imagine life after death and therefore to posit Suffering in this world in order to achieve well-being in the next so you're gonna take that away and You're talking about Killing You're talking about dogmas How does this work again I don't see how you're helping well-being or how religion makes this worse Now you might if i've read a fair i've read le vizel and and victor frankl for a while. I was on a reading a nazi concentration camp book kick Did their religious commitments make the Suffering in the concentration camp harder because they expected the lion divine deliverance maybe Having no religious beliefs as many who were killed by the nazis and especially the russians had i'm sure Did having no religious beliefs make? The concentration camp suffering better I would argue If you lock me up I'm gonna find my religious beliefs probably Greatly helping me and you say well, what evidence do you have that? Well, how many people come out of prison? Muslim or christian or with some religious beliefs and you might say well, let's use reason two Let's take god out of the picture and diagnose how that happens Well, you put them in a hard time and Their minds went to a certain type of escapism that imagined that there was purpose behind all the suffering There's a an atheistic Rationalistic story that accounts for religious belief And it accounts for religious belief by saying It's in their immediate well-being best interest to adopt the religious belief So how again does getting rid of religious belief? help here Uh, you're going to get everything you want after you die so this life doesn't matter issue that that allows for a kind of misbehavior that Is especially okay. Okay, that allows for a kind of misbehavior. Another thing you have to watch is that They're trying to have an argument about How can we find a moral yardstick? And and peterson begins can't be arbitrary. It's got to somehow be tethered to a reality That we can all agree on Good, so there's there's there's some boundaries in it. We want to find a moral yardstick Okay You have the difficulty of You're trying to find a moral yardstick But all along the way you keep taking elements of your argument and you bring in the moral yardstick and you say Well, this doesn't measure up now. Wait a minute. I thought this is what we're arguing about In other words, you can't bring it into the argument When you're trying to make an argument about its existence you can bring it in if you're using it to try to evaluate it, but What stocks behind this is sam harris has His own moral yardstick and he says well, this is well-being But now we're back to the question we had before well-being when and now this this inappropriate behavior Something that you are valuing Because you when you evaluate it as inappropriate you're already putting a moral art. You already putting a moral yardstick up to it Where did you get it? Yardstick up to it. Where did you get that yardstick? If hopefully the yardstick is the outcome of the conversation you can't bring it at this point into the argument So so it seems that so that the claim would be that if you if you put forward axiomatically your claim that god exists Then you can use that claim to justify whatever arbitrary Atrocities your system might throw off. Yeah I guess the only point I was making there is that not all dogmas are created equal and some dogmas are on their face More dangerous and more divisive, you know, right but but what I but they're all bad, right? Because he said that and he will continue to say that well, they're not all created equal. Well good I think that's progress because they're not all created equal so are we allowed to keep the good ones or the less bad ones and if We're dragged into a concentration camp and we find that religious Fantasies are helping our experience of well-being and that we can actually walk nobly up to the gallows Because we're finding this is enhancing our well-being Can we have some dogmas, please? I'm curious about specifically is because it seems to me that the dogmas of the USSR and the dogmas of Nazi Germany were as Pernicious as any religious dog dogmas and and they may also share important features with you pernicious religious Peterson is working his he's where he's building his railroad. He's working his argument It isn't clear to me from your perspective what those commonalities would be well, so I Mean in some ways you're recapitulating an argument I've made and this is an argument that I would make against you were you to claim as you've had you have elsewhere that that Atheism is responsible for the greatest atrocities of the 20th century the idea that Stalinism and Nazism and fascism were expressions of atheism simply doesn't make any sense I mean in the case of fascism and Nazism it doesn't make any sense because the Fascists and the Nazis by and large were not even atheists I mean Hitler wasn't an atheist and he was talking about Executing a divine plan and he got lots of support from the churches and the Vatican did nothing to stop him and fascism as you know Coexisted quite happily with Catholicism in Croatia and Portugal and Spain and Italy so but even in the case of Stalin what was so wrong with that situation was Were all the ways in which it so resembled a religion you had a personality cult you had dogmatism that is It religion itself or what religion does because they're both gonna say well So does religion talk about a? genetic fallacy does religion cause this or And this is where we're gonna go to Jane Goodall eventually does religion cause this or is this a human thing? and humans who like to pick up Rationalizations and justifications because they're the rider on the elephant. They're trying to make themselves look good Is religion that which We concoct in order to justify our Behavior now that makes a really devastating argument against religion But that's what you're practically saying here Held sway to a point where Apostasy and blasphemy were killing offenses, you know the people who now right there So if we're saying well, what was really wrong? Well, was it thought crimes and an implicit there is blasphemy and a pos Apostasy may not be killing offenses in other words In other words he's saying and quite rightly most of us in the West would agree there ought not to be thought crimes But here's the irony his entire project is trying to say Religion is a thought crime and it must be vanquished now. Fortunately if you look at my last video He says some scary things at the end of this But fortunately, he's not advocating that religious people be locked up. He's advocating that we be Persuaded now a little bit later when we get into the question of what the same Harris believe about evil Maybe he'll say that religion is ignorant. So then we have to be educated out of our ignorance. Okay who didn't toe the line were eradicated and Yeah, you know so and nor is it to take a more modern example North Korea is a religious cult it just doesn't happen to be a Okay Now we have the really fudgy word of religion. What there do you mean by religion is religion something that a word that we can use to Qualify a behavior. This is a religious activity. North Korea is a religious cult Even though North Korea is on paper an atheist cult This sounds a lot like Jordan Peterson saying Sam Harris you act like a Christian Sam Harris has basically taken Jordan P Peterson's argument and flipped it upside down and used it says even though North Korea will say everywhere. There is no God. They're religious It's exactly what Jordan Peterson has been saying to Sam Harris one that is focused on the next life or You know supernatural Is a religious so and nor is it to take a more modern example North Korea is a religious cult it just doesn't happen to be a one that is focused on the next life or or You know supernatural claim. No, I did hear it right. He just basically has made He just basically has done to North Korea what Jordan Peterson has done to him when he calls him a Christian He's just done the same thing. So what would magic? Okay So what would be the defining characteristics of a religious totalitarian movement that would make it different from a non-religious totalitarian movement? Well, it's just because there's aspects that are similar. Yeah, they may they're very similar The problem is dogmatism. The overarching problem is believing things strongly on bad evidence Okay right there The overarching problem is believing things strongly on bad evidence Let's fill out this now now we're starting to get Sam Harris's argument Okay, so we have a natural capacity to choose for our well-being We have this problem called dogmatism where we where we hold on to things rigidly When we have bad evidence for it Why Where did this come from Why did we start doing this if if human beings are that the kinds of creatures that rationally will usually choose well-being Happiness and goodness and everything flexible suit caseness over bad things Where did we get the dogmas from that? We started doing this now? He'd say well some people started using it against other people. Okay, why? Well, it was because it was in their best interest to give these other people dogmas to control them That's pretty much a postmodern critique So what you're saying is that these religious people who are giving dogmas to other people themselves aren't really religious because they're no They know they're fooling it so let's let's imagine a bunch of people who live in a village and you have you have strawberries and you have rotten potatoes and so What all the people what all the people in power? What the elites tell everyone is that the rotten potatoes are really good food for you and if you eat those rotten potatoes, then God will bless you and us you into the next life and then all of those elites actually eat strawberries now, that's not a bad story because This kind of stuff happens in religious communities all the time but Well being and rationality doesn't really work because you would Pretty much get the idea that what will happen is that the people eating the rotten tomatoes are gonna watch the people eating the strawberries And say hey, wait a minute and that game isn't gonna last long not 11 or 15,000 years at least so so where did this game come from or Are we back to the fact that? in this world We don't have a clear idea of what is good for us. We don't even know what to eat at this day and age What should people eat? We don't we don't do it. We don't have an idea of what is well being is nowhere near as obvious to us individually or communally It's most obvious to us in a moment. Well It would be my well-being to turn on the air conditioning in this building because I'm a little warm but I don't turn on the air conditioning in this building because I don't want to spend the church's money and on electricity just for me alone and Or maybe I'm a religious person So I'm suffering for Jesus sitting here with a fan on me instead of the air conditioning if I was a real Christian I turn off the fan and root but fans don't use as much air conditioning as the whole building so on and on and on and on and on and on And be and the reason why dogmatism is so dangerous is that it is It doesn't allow us to revise our bad ideas in real time through conversation It is dogmas have to be enforced by force or the threat of force See and even that so let's get to the rotten potato eaters and the strawberry eaters There's not gonna be a He's got both. It's got to be imposed by force. So the strawberry eaters have to keep the potato eaters Eating their rotten potatoes and don't let them know that there are strawberries to be had Well, probably the strawberry eaters if there were enough strawberries to feed the whole town the strawberry eaters Probably wouldn't have cared because you can only eat so many strawberries, but So, which is it is it the lack of a conversation or is it control The moment someone has a better idea you have to shut it down in order to preserve your dogma, okay Okay, so so the common personality seems to be something like Claims of absolute truth at some level that can't be controlled Claims of absolute truth at some level that can't be that you're no longer Allowed to discuss. Yeah, okay, and so Claims that you're no longer allowed to discuss That does happen in churches But there's a lot of discussion in churches and and this is where we get into the question of of the relationship between co-host career course of power and ideas And this is where we get into a lot of stuff that is deep in the American conversation Is it okay to punch a Nazi? Well if a Nazi is Doing Nazi like things breaking the law the state should lock them up. Can you? Can you punish people for ideas and Sam Harris would say and I think everyone on that stage would say well, that's exactly where these Totalitarian regimes were wrong and Sam is trying to say okay. Well, it's it's not necessarily the content of these ideas it's the practice of Punishing people for ideas and not letting people talk about ideas cool I'm down with that, but he's gonna spend most of the night complaining about the content of ideas Okay, so that's another point of agreement then I would say because part of the reason that I've been let's say a free speech advocate although I don't think that's the right way of thinking about it is because I think of Free discourse like the discourse that we're engaged in as the mechanism that corrects totalitarian excess or dogmatic excess And so I also think that systems so in other words If you have an institution that says the strawberry eaters and the rotten potato eaters Need to be able to talk to each other that's helpful because at some point the potato eaters are gonna say hey You munch on some potatoes share your strawberries with us of Governance that are laying themselves out properly have to evaluate have to elevate the process by which Dogmatic errors are corrected over the dogmas themselves, which is why I think you and the process of Correcting dogmatic errors How is this process maintained? Well, we write it down. Well, how is that represented? How does it get written down? Well, you you write it down someplace really important where everyone agrees like in a Constitution Yeah, and once you write it in a Constitution what it is it what has it become? And Peterson is saying yeah Dogmas are important Americans are right say with regard to their First Amendment is the process of free speech is the process by which dogmatic errors are rectified And so it has to be put at the pinnacle of the hierarchy of values Yeah, I think you and I totally agree about the primacy of free speech. Okay, and is free speech a dogma Okay, okay good. Okay, so that's another fun Come on Jordan ask him if it's a dogma Because it's not a dogma what Okay, so then we couldn't think there's there's one point that we should just lock in our games here I love this part it sounds like what you're saying is that the reason to fear Religious dogma is really on the dogma side and not the religion side which at least leaves open the Possibility that something could exist over on the religion side that doesn't have that characteristic right that often they travel in Tandem but that the thing to fear is not the religious belief. It is the dogmatic nature of the way it is Oh, yeah The other way to say that is the only thing that's wrong with religion is the dogmatism Wait, I want to hear that again if you get rid of the dog I've got only thing that's wrong with religion is the dogmatism The other way to say that is the only thing that's wrong with religion is the dogmatism the other way to say that is the only thing that's wrong with religion is the dogmatism the Other way to say that is the only thing that's wrong with religion Is the dogmatism the other way to say that is the only thing that's wrong with religion is the dogmatism Remember that Because he won't If you get rid of the backside no problem with the buildings and the music and the paintings and get rid of the... I've got no problem with the buildings and the music and the paintings and... Wait, wait, no, that... Wait a minute, wait a minute. That's not a trivial point and it's not just a joke. And Peterson jumps. Now when you get into the Dublin talk, they're going to come back to this and it's important because basically Sam Harris is saying religion contaminates everything and so we've got to get rid of it. Okay, like the thought crime. We've got to get rid of these thoughts. Okay, but thought crimes are hugely problematic. Remember when you talked about blasphemy and apostasy? Blasphemy is saying wrong things. Apostasy is believing wrong things. And he's saying, but all the other expressions, the art and the buildings, I don't have a problem with. And it's like... Really? Because... And again, and that's why Jordan Peterson pounces. Because... Wait a minute, that's not a trivial point and it's not just a joke because the buildings and the music are very important parts of the religious process and so... They're important parts of the religious process. What does that mean? The buildings and the music and the art are part of the... This is how... We're going to get some Protestantism here. This is how religious people are religious. It's how they be religious. It's how they express religion. If you see a cathedral, why do you... If you're Sam Harris and you go into cathedral, I would think if he's consistent, he should have the same experience going into Auschwitz. This is the argument he's making. But why go into cathedral and say, oh, look at the beautiful building, and not go into Auschwitz and say, oh, I can appreciate the engineering and the efficiency of this place? No! So in this part of the talk, Sam Harris gives up the game a number of times. It's like saying, yeah, I fired Comey because of the Russia thing. Anybody listening? Lester Holt heard it. Saturday Night Live heard it. I know there's a humorous element to that, but it's not like Sam is throwing out the baby with the bath water there. Sam Harris is keeping the baby because he's not sloshing the bath water around at all. In a sense, he wants to take the baby out of the bath water and keep the bath water. That's essentially what Sam Harris just said. In fact, I'm deeply interested in the fact that in the phenomenology of spiritual experience. So whatever experience someone like Jesus had, whoever he was historically, or any of the other matriarchs and patriarchs of the world's religions, that phenomenology is subjectively real. I mean, it's diverse. I'm not saying everyone's had the same experience, but it's subjectively real. Okay, let's get back to your definition of which is real in your monarchical vision. What does it mean that something is subjectively real? Well, it means that I experienced it and it's self-evident. There needs to be no validation of the experience. Okay, but that experience is going to make claims on future action and claims on interpretations of the past. And in a sense, Sam Harris has taken the baby out and keeping the bath water here. There are changes in consciousness that explain both how religions have gotten founded by their founders and the experiences people have had in the presence of those people, or by following their methodologies. Don't you think the dogmas came out of these experiences? Don't you think they had a vision for, not unlike Sam's vision, for reason, the elastic suitcase, and imagine John Lennon, that was rolling around in my head. This is Sam Harris's vision for a new world, okay? And this is his subjective, real experience. I'm sure his hormones get excited and he gets impassioned when he thinks about this, and out of this flows dogmas. And in fact, most of these dogmas Sam Harris is going to give us, like, thou shalt not make rules based on bad evidence. It's a dogma, and it's a dogma you're promoting. Now, fortunately, again, we're living in a society where these dogmas are not backed up by the use of force, but you've just set down a dogma. That seemed to be confirming of the dogmas that grew up around those traditions, and my issue is that whatever is true about us spiritually, whatever opportunity... I want to know what he means by that word spiritually. Whatever's true of us spiritually, I think he means whatever's true of us experientially. So what word can you substitute in for spiritually? Spiritually? Whatever we have experienced... Being born to this universe actually presents as a matter of consciousness spiritually. That... He used it again. ...whatever opportunity being born to this universe actually presents as a matter of consciousness spiritually. That truth has to be deeper than accidents of culture and just mere historical contingencies and... What is he saying here? ...people have had in the presence of those people or by following their methodologies that seem to be confirming of the dogmas that grew up around those traditions, and my issue is that whatever is true about us spiritually, whatever opportunity being born to this universe actually presents as a matter of consciousness spiritually, that truth has to be deeper than accidents of culture and just mere historical contingencies. The fact that somebody was born in Mesopotamia and not in China and got a different language game. Did he just make an argument that the spiritual experiences of the great founders of religion say more about... Say something more than the cultural and historical sum that leads up to those experiences. That's what he just said. Now Jordan Peterson at this point inside, you see him lean forward here, he's got to be thinking, yeah I fired Comey because of Russia. Game over. Cancel the other events. This is Jordan Peterson's big point. And so Sam Harris just gave away the the religious versus the religion versus dogma, said it's the dogmatism, and now he says what the great founders of religions and spirituality experienced is greater than the sum total of the cultural accidents that led up to them. Okay, say more. So whatever is true there has to be understood in universal terms about the nature of human psychology and that's Jordan Peterson's entire project and the human mind. Okay, so so another thing that that I wanted to just point out obliquely and then I now we're going to go off the rails. I want to return to outlining maybe where we agree. We're not going to get back here. One of the things that was really shocking to me I would say was the my reading of what was originally... See if we end it and I'm going to end mine right here. If we ended it right here, after 20 minutes you would say Jordan Peterson won. If you're paying attention, Sam Harris has both just completely given up any claim that religious dogmatism, that it's the dogmatism side not the religion side that is the real problem, and just said the spiritual experiences by the religious founders were not simply accidents of their culture and their time but they express something universal about human beings. So Jordan Peterson won. But with Jane Goodall and the chimps we're going to send it to Merckwood. So I'm going to call an end to this video right now and on to the next one.
