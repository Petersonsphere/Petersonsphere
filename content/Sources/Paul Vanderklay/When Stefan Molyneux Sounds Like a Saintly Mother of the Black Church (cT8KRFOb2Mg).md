 Hi, this is Paul. I wanted to make a real quick video on a video that I listened to some of this morning It was one of these chopped up videos, you know how people take Jordan Peterson's videos and chop out little sections Well, this is one from someone chopped out from Stefan Molyneux. I never heard of the guy until Some of some of the buckles have mentioned him to me. He's a Canadian He has a podcast or a radio show or something like this I think politically is over on the libertarian fringe I'm sure many of you in the comment sections will enlighten me who the guy is and and what his deal is but but on this on this on this video someone he was talking to someone over the phone who was a who was a father of a child by his girlfriend and then another child is on the way and he never married this girl and and Just a Mala Neal is just kind of taking this guy apart because of his bad decisions and It was amazing to me that the guy just stays in and continues to take it. I mean, that's what status will that's what status will do for you, but what really struck me about it is here you have a in the midst of all this conversation about identity politics you have a white Canadian Libertarian anarchist is that fair to categorize him? I don't really know not Christian taken apart another Canadian guy Sounded like an Anglo guy and Just what so struck me about it was I've heard these kinds of conversations all my life But they were usually given by African American women Christians up in age to young African American men that were raised in the church and Should have known better and I just thought what does this say about our cultural moment when I'm hearing? conversations from this guy over here that sound a lot like many conversations I've Overheard or been a part of or listened to by frustrated black women over here about Men's lack of responsibility For themselves and to their partners, so I just that was just really an amazing Just seeing those two things really amazed me So I wanted to just make that point and go on with the rest every day
