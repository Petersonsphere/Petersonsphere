 This is Paul. I'm gonna try and do a short video and then a longer video on the human sacrifice segment of the Sam Harris Jordan Peterson conversation. I'm not gonna play any of it I'm gonna wait and do some of that from when the main video comes out but human sacrifice always comes up on these in these conversations, which is really quite interesting because To my knowledge nobody is doing it But this is something that Sam Harris and a lot of people bring up is the goal to stop it But if it's not happening, why are you trying to stop it? Is it to look moral? Is it to be moral? So let's let's dive in and I'll try and keep moving Well now we can all agree that human sacrifice is generally a bad thing, but now there are nested within this question What do you mean by human and what do you mean by sacrifice? And in the longer video get into both of those questions But let's just take the plain common-sense Definition that killing a person in order to appease or please or negotiate with a divine being realm or construct I think that's pretty much what their argument is now Sam Harris seems to allege that past human sacrifice Morally compromises a social system and so Christianity Judaism Islam and I assume Hinduism and and other religious systems are compromised because all of their all of their goods all of their Conversations are let's say downstream from human sacrifice, which seems to have been ubiquitous Now this is a funny argument to make to me because when Peterson calls Sam Harris a Christian We start playing the the the fallacy pop-up game, which is oh, that's the genetic fallacy and well, okay So if you have Christian ideas, but you don't want to be called You shouldn't be called a Christian because of the genetic fallacy. Why would Christianity be morally compromised? Because it has actual human sacrifice in its past even though no Christian that I know of today is promoting or practicing Actual human sacrifice and we seem to love that word literal so literal human sacrifice now human sacrifice was Represented an animal substitution animal sacrifice many will agree is a substitution for human sacrifice And I agree with that I think in the old in the Old Testament as a Christian you read that and the animal stood in place of the human being In terms of the sacrificial system and see the longer video that I did on sacrifice in the Bible Is is animal sacrifice instead of human beings and improvement? I think we could probably agree now It's also something that's less obvious, but human sacrifice was replaced in Judaism by Torah observance Now I talked about that a bit in my Sunday school class last week and I can put the links for both of those Into the comments here, but basically when when if you're going not going to do the high places which continually gets which continually gets criticized and let's say the book of Kings and The altar in Jerusalem for prescribed worship is no longer for for actual sacrifice is no longer available What the Jews did in history was Torah observance in the synagogue and then synagogue practice started and synagogue practice eventually Morphed into what we see in Christian worship now obviously human sacrifices ritualized and replaced By Eucharist communion Lord Supper and Peterson and and and Harris talked a little bit about this How can this moral compromise be resolved to his satisfaction? That's a question I would have for him or is it just everything's tainted downstream from human human Sacrifice I would argue that a whole lot more will be tainted downstream from that So if that's gonna be your standard well Then you're kind of you're kind of a Christian if you're going to use this kind of this kind of criteria now the goal is stop it which is kind of a funny goal because People aren't doing it But let's run through the argument Sam Harris seems to say that What we would have to have is a rule or an understanding or an injunction or a norm not to kill people to appease Satisfy favor negotiate with imaginary beings. We don't want people doing that. So we need a rule and This rule apparently can be come about by reason if we have no imaginary beings We're not going to sacrifice humans for that reason. Is it okay to sacrifice humans for other reasons? And again, I'll touch on that in the longer video. What do we mean by sacrifice? What do we mean by human but specifically here we were talking about We're talking about appeasing satisfying favoring negotiating with imaginary beings divine beings Which would be the actual frame of reference now again, most people say downstream from Christianity killing is wrong, so Well, then do we need this rule? But we also seem we say killing is wrong and many people who can agree with killing is wrong what they don't agree with are the exceptions when killing is justifiable and It's actually on that playing field that most of the moral conversation holds. Everyone will agree killing is wrong But some people say well, it's justifiable in some circumstances So is it the case that human sacrifice is justifiable in certain circumstances and perhaps not in Circumstances where there is an imaginary being or divine being that needs to be appeased satisfied favored or negotiated with so basically here the motivation for Sam Harris's or the Strategy for Sam Harris to prevent human sacrifice in the future would be have a rule and this rule could apparently supposedly be justified rationally or supported rationally instead of by some religious dogma or some religious story or some religious text now Christianity obviously Uses dogma story and text and its prohibition of human sacrifice, but it takes a different approach Christianity the one perfect human sacrifice was made can read about that in the Heideberg Catechism One of the doctrinal statements of the Christian Reformed Church We no longer do it and we don't do it to animals either for this same reason in other words the Christian articulation surrounding human sacrifice and sacrifice in general actually takes into account human sacrifice and animal sacrifice and Frames that actually in quite a large frame with quite a few Let's call them feelers going out in many different directions again in the larger sacrifice video I'll talk about that How do Christians do this? Well, we ritualized to remember and reinforce the message that doing it again would be unnecessary now both of those ends are important because The ritualization is to remember so every time you see a bumper sticker 9-eleven don't forget every time you see a Holocaust Memorial. Let's never forget every time there's a school shooting. Let's never forget Let's never forget it seems we have on one hand Something we want something we believe is more powerful than just a rule Because I think we already have plenty of rules that say don't drive airplanes into buildings or don't don't shoot up schools We've got all of those rules those rules don't seem to stop people and you might argue Well religious things don't seem to stop people to 9-elevens case It seemed to be religious motivation that was driving the people into the planes, but let's get back to human sacrifice. So Sam Harris's strategy of course is if you get rid of religion Then we won't have people shooting up schools for religious reasons and we don't have people driving planes into buildings for religious reasons That obviously doesn't prevent them from shooting up schools or driving planes into buildings for non-religious reasons or for reasons that They say are religious but aren't really religious or reasons that are religious but they say are not religious because all of those things would happen to and In Christianity we ritualized to reinforce and remember and we ritualized when we put this very deep in terms of our Psychic selves and we make this a very core foundational thing We put this pretty much down at the root which makes it pretty strong And and it's also important to notice that what is said is not just yes human sacrifice is wrong We can agree with that but that human sacrifice is unnecessary and that I would argue is a deeper Motivational mission than merely a rule because someone who shoots up a school would say well I think it's wrong to shoot up a school but shooting up a school is necessary and I would dare bet even the 9-eleven Attackers would say yeah Normally speaking driving planes into buildings is wrong, but in this case driving planes into building is necessary so I would argue that locating the prohibition on that which is Unnecessary is a stronger more forceful prohibition than just having a rule that says it's not rational to do so Is unnecessary more is unnecessary more powerful than wrong? Especially when we are so good at justification for doing what we tell ourselves is necessary I think so and this is where it gets very interesting because Sam Harris repeatedly talks about dogma dogma is a problem Unchanging things is a problem I'd like to know if the no human sacrifice rule is a dogma or not And if it's a dogma he agrees with I would dare bet he's not imagining that at some point in the future We will change and decide that it is now rational to do human suit sacrifice with or without imaginary beings Well, you can't have rationality with imaginary beings according to sam harris. So boom there it is But I would like to know under what cases he would imagine this dogma would be overturned and to keep it from becoming a dogma So let's just have it be a suggestion out in the community that Human sacrifice that's kind of not a good idea, but we don't want to make it a dogma because we don't like dogmas Well, I think in many ways this forgets what dogmas are for dogmas are shorthand ways and default Understandings that are communally regarded that say things like we're not going to we're not going to conduct human sacrifice We're not going to do it And well, why don't we do it just because I said so are there reasons? Yeah, I have good reasons I believe I have very good reasons But you might not be able to construct the rationality tower that I can construct So instead i'm going to construct the rationality tower. I'm going to get to a certain point You on the basis of my authority Are going to hold this as a dogma and therefore this dogma will be remembered It will be well, what are you going to do? How are you going to maintain it in the community? You're going to have to remember which means you're probably going to have to ritualize it And I would say that pretty much making bumper stickers about never forget on 9 11 is a ritualization Of a dogma that is deeply implicit in the message along with a good many other things So does he want this to be a no human sacrifice rule to become a dogma? I would argue he probably does isn't a dogma something you no longer have to redo the reason you're an Experimentation on yes. I think that's the purpose of a dogma and that's why humanity has dogmas Implicit or explicit and I think they work for humanity for this very reason Christianity says human sacrifice is no longer effective. It's no longer necessary It no longer accomplishes anything and I would argue that is a more powerful Motivator than just having a rule, especially if you're shy of dogma So there's my attempt at a short video on this i'm going to try and make a longer video We'll see how I did. Let me know if you like the short ones
