 Hi, this is Paul. It's been kind of a weird week for me with my on-again, off-again vacation. I'm working on a passage from the Book of Second Kings for Sunday, and it's a very famous story about Hezekiah and his illness. And as I was thinking about that passage and working on that passage, I thought a lot about the Jordan Peterson, Sam Harris conversations. One of the fascinating things about listening to those bootleg recordings, and again, I'm really looking forward to the better recordings coming out because you'll be able to hear it all much better. It'll be much better to listen to. But one of the things that I keep thinking about when I listen to these conversations is what exactly is the concern and the offense that the celebrity or career atheists have, and why Jordan Peterson makes them so nervous. Now you can find the mouthy Buddha's take on why Jordan Peterson is taking fans away from Sam Harris, and there's a significant overlap in their community, and I know that from experience. But I always try to, as well as I can, really figure out where the emotional reaction comes from on the part of the of the atheists against religion and why. And this is something that fascinates me nearly endlessly, and I've done a lot of thinking about it over the years. And as I was thinking about the conversations between them and this passage in Hezekiah, just one morning this, I usually work on my PowerPoints early in the morning, or my videos of this. I get up first thing in the morning and just take my thoughts and try to distill them down. And it just had a whole range of thoughts about this, and I put them all together and I dumped them all in here. So this is going to be kind of Sam Harris meets the Hezekiah story, and this Hezekiah story is going to be enormously reactive for a lot of atheists, because it has so many of the elements that that just make, that just really upset them. So let's run through the story, because it's not a story that many of you probably know. Hezekiah was one of the last great kings of the southern nation, Judin, if you're following my Sunday series and my Sunday sermons. We're leading up to that. And last week I preached about Hezekiah, and this week I'll preach about this text, although I'm still working on the sermon. I don't really have a rough draft, and my schedule this week is a little bit wonky, so I'm not sure I'll get a rough draft out or how that will go this week, but we'll see. But this is a very, this is a fairly famous story. It's a story about Hezekiah's illness, and it goes like this. In those days Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. The prophet Isaiah, son of Amos, went to him and said, this is what the Lord says, put your house in order, because you are going to die. You will not recover. Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord, remember Lord how I have walked before you faithfully and with wholehearted devotion have done what is good in your eyes. And Hezekiah wept bitterly. Before Isaiah had left the middle court, the word of the Lord came to him. Go back and tell Hezekiah, the ruler of my people, this is what the Lord, the God of your father David says, I've heard your prayer and seen your tears and I will heal you. On the third day from now you will go up to the temple of the Lord and I will add 15 years to your life and I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city for my sake and for the sake of my servant David. Now right there, this is exactly the kind of story that Sam Harris wants destroyed and never remembered and not believed in, because here we have a king basing his status and relationship on God, on his moral performance and this God listening to him and hearing his prayer and just everything about this story will, this is exactly the kind of thing that the celebrity atheist says this needs to go away and in fact the story even gets worse. Then Isaiah said prepare a poultice of figs and it's like well if God's going to heal them why bother with the figs? They did this and applied it to the boil and he recovered. So was, is this all this God stuff imaginary? Was it the figs that healed him? Is this whole story made up or you know there was a king Hezekiah and that's a, he's a historical figure. We have evidence of him from the chronicles of Assyria and from other sources and maybe you know the whole thing was just a, you have this series of events and they used a made-up story and here he got well and he lived 15 more years and boom this kind of thing is, this is all the worst kind of things that, that atheists hate about religious stories and religious people who believe in them and then it even gets worse because Isaiah answered this is the Lord's sign to you that the Lord will do what he promised. What Hezekiah doesn't believe him. Shall the shadow go forward 10 steps or shall it go back 10 steps? It is a simple matter for the shadow to go forward 10 steps said Hezekiah rather it should go back 10 steps. When the prophet Isaiah called on the Lord and the Lord made the shadow go back 10 steps it had gone down the stairway of Ahaz and it's like what? Now God makes the sun go back you know or you know maybe there was an eclipse or may you know you can go forever but the the imagined universe of the story is exactly what the atheists object to and here we have maybe it's a fable maybe it's a legend but this invites people to believe, to believe what? To believe that if I get sick I can pray and God might listen to me and heal me and we don't want people believing this and we don't want people doing this because people believing and doing this is the source of all kinds of misery so you have Jehovah's Witnesses not getting blood transfusions you've got religious people shaming and other religious people for not believing God and then you have all the things about well you prayed to God and you followed James and you called the elders and you did the anointing with oil but you weren't healed and so maybe there's unconfessed sin and round and round and round and if here's the funny thing I as a religious person have been around Christians all my life Sam Harris knows a little bit of this I know way way more of it and in some senses my cynicism and my skepticism and my doubt and how I've seen the games played around this I mean so on one hand when I listen to Sam Harris complain about this stuff I have so many examples of this that I could give Sam Harris and say I'm with you Sam I'm with you Sam there's so much charlatanism and foolishness and superstition and on and on and on and Sam Harris says it's better to get rid of the whole thing and I say no well you just said you know way more about this than Sam Harris knows yeah so why aren't you looking to get rid of this whole thing why not box the whole thing up and throw it in the sea and have us all be rational people and well maybe pastor when you pray with someone they feel a little better and maybe that helps them psychosomatically and encourages them and then maybe a tiny little percentage of them gets better because yes we're more complex than we know but basically when someone is ill I send them to a doctor and if they say yeah but I'm going to go to my and I say no go to a doctor who actually went to medical school who believes in science and and that's what I say and that's what I do and and then they come at me and with a lot of religious stories and stuff that I consider superstition and I listen to them and I listen to them and then I have sympathy for Sam Harris I really do and and so along comes Jordan Peterson and Jordan Peterson isn't a religious fanatic by any means and Sam Harris looks at him and says yeah you're a little too close to the fanatics we want a rationalist clean room to set up and get rid of this religious mumbo jumbo and religious hocus pocus and religious superstition and have people deal rationally and if we could just get rid of all this religious stuff then rationality would rule and the world would be better and people would stop having a religious conflict so on and so forth and I listen to that and I'll say Sam no I'm keeping the religion well why well let's run through some things the first thing I hear from the from the from the atheists are the moral objection that you have a moral duty to disbelieve this story now this is an interesting point that is seldom explored and if you know a little bit of history you know that well number one ancient people weren't skeptical or gullible they knew a lot of foolishness around religious even if they were religion even if they were far more religious and if you read the bible you can see all kinds of games being played I listen to this prophet and not that prophet you know go back and look at my sermon on on king ahab and you know the ancient people were not dumb with respect to this read the book of daniel nebuchadnezzar him putting the screws on his wise men and going to kill them all because they can't tell him his dream you're supposed to see behind the veil but you can't do anything as simple as tell me a dream all of this were known by ancient people so where does this moral objection come from that says if you are religious person you you there's a moral failure involved for believing stories like this well where does that come from actually it comes from the enlightenment and it comes from john lock and some of you know that I've I've used this this course before I think it's an excellent course philosophy philosophy and religion in the west by by Philip Carey who teaches at eastern university has a degree from Yale so yeah he has a degree from a real university and he talks about evidentialism which basically developed with john lock and unlike dick heart lock's main concern is not with scientific knowledge he thinks we have very little of that but with belief and in a culture where catholics and a large variety of protestants think that they do not share their beliefs are justly that those who do not share their beliefs are justly punished in this world and the next the question is what ought I believe now what's really interesting about the about listening to sam harris and many of the other atheists is that they put a lot of ought into this belief and almost becomes a thought crime jordan peterson you ought not to have religious thoughts uh paul vanderkley pastor vanderkley you ought not to be encouraging this kind of thing now that's a rather funny thing this ought on this so why ought i not certainly sam harris isn't going to say god is going to hold me accountable in the way that catholics and protestants in john lock's age imagined that god would hold them accountable for their beliefs so so so why are you trying to govern what i believe anyway why what made you the thought police well this this actually goes back to john lock and so what you're saying is that even this evidentialist system that they assume and employ to try and shame religious people out of their belief systems that itself is a product of the catholic protestant feud and that itself in fact is a product of of christian religion oh do we have the do we have the genetic fallacy coming on here lock proposes a way of governing and regulating the formation of our beliefs so that we will be doing our duty doing our best to limit to be limited doing our best as limited rational beings to form our beliefs properly in fact this entire rational belief admonition that sam harris is giving is is all based on john lock hence while the cart and lock are both dealing with the anxiety of uncertainty lock deals with it by seeking certainty not by seeking certainty but by proposing that if we do our best we shall not be blame worthy by god even if we come up with the wrong answer and and so here is something that's implicit in the rationalist is that religious people have have a moral failing but they never pause and reflect on this moral failing who's to hold them accountable for this moral failing shall we hold each other accountable for this moral failing what should be the consequences of this moral failing how shall the thought police govern this now again they get very reactive when we start talking about totalitarian communist regimes where in fact they were governing that's basically what the soviet union and what what marxist china did was try to govern try to be the thought police to try and get religious thoughts out of people's heads that's where this goes now god is thought police but god obviously is imagining a judgment day later and isn't too careful about policing us now an angel doesn't come and zap me when i have straying religious thoughts god seems more lenient than the communists locks locks basic rule for governing our beliefs has been called evidentialism we should proportion our belief to the strength of the evidence you've heard that before in fact de la hunty and harris trot this out almost every time and jordan peterson assumes it too this has become the dominant the dominant moral system governing belief for us today and it comes from john lock and john lock was a christian so the strength of the evidence is to be assessed in terms of new and modern conception of probability in the middle ages probable meant approved by authority now and i spoken about this in past videos evidence is supposed to be empirical and it's supposed to be public and it's supposed to be objective and what we mean by objective is that multiple parties can see it and it somehow is resistant to our biases to the degree that we can achieve that and again this is why we have we have we always have difficulty of achieving this and psychology has been dealing with this quite a bit in the last few years so tells me the psychologists empiricism evidentialism and religion john locks picture of the self is a dark inner room as a historical descendant of augustine's picture of the inner self as a place in which we turn to find god but there's a huge difference augustine's inner room is like a courtyard of a palace with no roof or divine light pouring in from above lock has put a roof on the inner space of the self it is not natural to have an inward vision of god there but only images of the sensible world now this gets there there are reasons for that that were part of the religious conflict of locks day the crucial evidence on behalf of revealed religion for lock are the miracles of the gospel which testified to the truth of the christian religion locks evidentialist beliefs ethic of beliefs thus favors mainstream christianity and militates again enthusiasm enthusiasm was this more emotional it's something akin to pentecostalism today but go back and read stories from the great awakenings read jonathan edwards read that history and you'll have a sense of the enthusiasm that lock is talking about once evidentialism is widely accepted however it will be used in arguments against all religions or against the existence of god in general something lock had not anticipated thus evidentialism takes a skeptical turn and this in fact is where we are today to the degree that these people admonishing evidentialism so stridently keep you keeping an eye on my phone because i've got messages coming in those admonishing evidentialism so stridently have completely forgotten the christian roots of their evidentialism so what we have in terms of this moral objection is we in a sense have an enforced evidentialism it is social pressure and in a sense the all the rationalists will group up as a group and say you're not still believing superstition are you you're not still believing religion are you they don't actually justify the system itself or even name it it's simply assumed and it's it's basically they basically use group pressure and status pressure we smart people of high status don't believe the superstitious things now if they actually move to another country and we're surrounded by other people for whom all of the status is very religious indeed well suddenly they would be in the minority and then we're talking status games and so what tends to happen in the west is we have this public private game people keep their private beliefs in the closet in public they're not going to trot out any supernatural story but in private maybe they're believing it they've got their lucky numbers they're secretly reading the horoscopes they would be doing all of this and it's mostly a public shaming exercise and it doesn't eradicate the pervasive non-evidentialist thinking you basically drive everyone into the closet and they won't admit it in public but they sure will practice it in private now the rationalist dream is is that somehow they imagine that this can through usually public shaming they can eliminate religious thinking and make people rational but again i've never seen them actually articulate a means by which to do so now you can go the east german way and have everybody spying on each other and and catching each other and superstitious or religious thinking but they claim that that's not in their agenda they want to do this within a free state well go ahead good luck i haven't seen much evidence that it's really worked it's it's worked fairly well in public but not not too well in terms of private there's no there's no evidence that that their scheme will actually work and it really assumes a lot of unfounded assumptions about what rationality is and how it works and again go back and see the the ian mcgillquist video where where i think he basically nails rationality when he says rationality is a method or strategy in pursuit of consistency in other words you build rationality upon a foundation but that foundation itself is a presupposition it's something you bring to the argument it's not something you derive from the argument and so therefore things are rational within world views if for example you're a jehovah's witnesses and you believe that life is in the blood then it's rational to oppose blood transvisions one of the huge ironies is is that if you look at the anti-vaccination movements you'll find that these are people with university degrees who have been educated and now they're out there saying well we don't want our children vaccinated because vaccines cause autism and even by naming this i am inviting a flood of of vax and anti-vax comments in the comment for this video vanderkley is taking a stance on vaccinations you want to know my stance on vaccinations vaccinate your children that's my stance on vaccinations vaccinate your children i just was at the doctor and he did a blood test and says oh you're not you're um you're not immune to measles so i got a vaccinations i said why aren't i immune to measles i got vaccinated as a kid the doctor said well we thought that you know one vaccination was good enough way back in the day when i get vaccinated now we know it isn't well that puts skepticism and rationality on science but we're all working at it so i go to a regular doctor with a degree on on on his wall and he does blood tests and i take vaccinations but when you look at the schools that aren't vaccinating well these are often middle or upper middle class schools people with university degrees and many of these people are not religious at all and to me the the notion that if you could and again they have no program for it if you could get rid of religious thinking then suddenly people are going to be rational and i say nope you're going to have them responding to their phobias you're going to have their them responding to their neuroses you're going to have them responding to whatever ideas they read on the internet this is how people are we believe things for reasons of our own reasons that are idiosyncratic to our experience whether or not how you were treated as you were as a child whether or not you were adopted the experiences that you had that you that you developed from childhood all of these will weigh into believability or non-believability and this imagination of a rational universe to me is just preposterous people just don't work this way so the rationalist dream if you get rid of these ancient stories then educated people will be unified no more religious conflict hogwash watch people fight about vaccinations or immigration or politics take take the atheist the atheist can't get together on any page over all of these things people will suffer less no more superstition i doubt it i watch people suffer from neuroses and phobias and anxieties for all sorts of things people will bless the world they'll be more generous and religious people continue to be more generous than non-religious people and this is a fact of sociology that gets reinforced again and again and again and again there's zero if you want to be an evidentialist i have seen hardly any reason to imagine that the rationalist dream the rationalist program will ever result in that which they say it will result and my and my belief in this has everything to do with just watching people and how they make decisions and how they live and what they're anxious about and i would imagine if if sam harris were a clinical psychologist sitting in a room and listening to people all day i think he'd see the same i think you'd see things the same way and i i think if you talk to people who work with people at a very private level if you talk to clinical psychologists and social workers and pastors and cops and nurses people who have a chance to listen to people when they're speaking their mind what you will see is that people they're racist they're sexist they're superstitious they're superstitious they're governed by their phobias they're governed by their fears people are not rational we just aren't and i really don't know how you're going to get them that way i really don't especially if you're not going to try everything that the communist tried in terms of a totalitarian system you want an illustration steve jobs read walter isaacson's biography of steve's job steve jobs came down with pancreatic cancer and lucky for him it was a fairly treatable kind of pancreatic cancer but to the horror of his friends and wife jobs decided not to have surgery to remove the tumor which was the only acceptable medical approach i really didn't want them to open my body so i tried to see if a few other things would work he told me years later with a hint of regret specifically he kept to a strict vegan diet with large quantities of fresh carrot and fruit juices to that regiment he added acupuncture a variety of herbal remedies and occasionally a few other treatments he found on the internet or by consulting people around the world including a psychic for a while he was under the sway of a doctor who operated a natural healing clinic in southern california that stressed the use of organic herbs fruit juices frequent bowel cleansing hydrotherapy and the expression of all negative and the expression of all negative feelings when job discussed his diet treatments you know you cannot resolve this without surgery and blasting it with toxic chemicals even the diet doctor dean ornish a pioneer and alternative in nutritional methods for treating diseases took a long walk with jobs and insisted that something sometimes traditional methods were the right option you really need surgery ornish told him jobs obstinacy obstinacy lasted for nine months after his october 2003 diagnosis part of this was the product of the dark side of his reality distortion field i think steve has such a strong desire for the world to be a certain way he wills it to be that way levenson speculated sometimes it doesn't work reality is unforgiving the flip side of his wondrous ability to focus was his fearsome willingness to filter out things he did not wish to deal with this led to many great breakthroughs but could also backfire he has that ability to ignore stuff that he doesn't want to confront powell powell explained it's just the way he's wired whether it involves personal topics relating to his family and marriage or professional issues relating to engineering or business challenges or health or cancer issues jobs sometimes simply didn't engage in the past he was rewarded for what his wife called his magical thinking his assumption that he would will things that to be as he wanted but cancer doesn't work that way powell enlisted someone close to him including his sister mona simpson to try to bring him around in july 2004 as CAT scan showed that the tumor had grown and possibly spread and it forced him to face reality steve jobs he wasn't a jehovah's witnesses he wasn't a christian he wasn't believing an ancient story or was he this is how people are this is how successful people are this is how high status people are this is how the demigods of our culture are because steve steve jobs is pretty close to that this is how people are and well we're going to make him a rationalist never would have invented the iphone there's no serious plan or provable method by making people rational there's little basis that this works for anyone they have no rationalist united happy uber successful community to prove their theory it has been tried now peterson will come back and say it has been tried and well they'll come back and say it has been it hasn't been tried and don't you dare say communism and then there's more social bullying but even steve jobs couldn't pull it off the next issue they have is the supernatural oh the supernatural the heart of the offense is often mentioned or the assertion of the supernatural i can talk to god well what do they mean by supernatural that's terribly difficult actually to define rationally some events are processed that cannot be explained by a previously known or potentially knowable causality even in theory and again see c.s lewis's the whole show but the problem is they can't begin the story of the universe without that because they're by any strep by any definition the big bang would be supernatural because there's no pattern for it and it's the whole story begins with one and this is basically what peterson says the problem they have is that the current secular scientific cosmology today begins with an event that is non-repeatable non-repeating not to the best of our knowledge non-predicted and a unique event most often called the big bang which no one can adequately account for by using any of the laws of nature because it itself is a source of what people call the laws of nature what this amounts to is give us one miracle and we'll explain the rest and then the point that i've been thinking about is recognizing the supernatural and look at my look at my video about flatland well all you'd recognize if you were in flatland is lines growing larger and smaller that's all you would see from within flatland and it's only from this monarchical vision that we look down upon flatland that we would have a 3d monarchical vision that we would have any idea of what perhaps a sphere entering into flatland would look like because what we usually just see are patterns we see patterns and we see enough of those patterns and we we we ourselves call them laws of nature and we use these as the basis for our predictions we would notice a disruption in a normal pattern but all our patterns are data sets which are always limited now they feel like good data sets to us but when you look at say the weird revolution in terms of psychology when they realized that all of the all of the data sets that people were taking in terms of psychology tended to be for a bot from a rather limited set of cultures and that other peoples around the world saw things in ways that made them test differently in these supposedly psychological tests well then they had a big problem see we presume these data sets into a monarchical vision which has eternity which is basically some static imagined clean room situation and then we say ah we can make predictions in them but that's basically what Newtonian mechanics does here are these data sets here's what we predict and given these aspects this is what should happen the problem is we can't even assert all the givens we would need in order for these things to happen now this is where the pragmatists roll in well it's good enough so that it's working for us and that's true and that's good and it's powerful but it isn't everything and it isn't perfect and what we basically do is extrapolate and say this is what we go with it generally works but we know that this prognostication is always limited by the data set all you need is one piece of data that would destroy it and that's always the great fear of one miracle explodes the entire the entire thing it's a terribly fragile thing part of the problem is we don't actually see causality all we see are the patterns now another offense that I often read in this are the offensive divine person and and this is I think really gets at another another area of reactivity in this that Hezekiah would have a personal relationship with God and the basis of this God would change his administration of the history and physics we find this offensive I believe we deeply desire it as first persons we might be offended that Hezekiah would have some relationship we might be skeptical when somebody in our world claims such a relationship we might be offended by it but we dearly wish we had one we dearly wish that every time our child would sick would sick all we would have to do is pray and God would hear all child we dearly wish that I had the Midas touch so I could pick up an object and say I need a little bit more money bang it turns to gold I take it down to the gold store they cash me out I dearly wish I had that power we dearly wish we had God's power but we don't and so envy becomes a part of this becomes a part of the offense now the definition of God as pantheism comes in at this point or even Peterson's axiomatic God that well we have problems with Hezekiah believing he's got a personal relationship with this God and can make requests of this God but what if we define God as everything that there is and the great cause of everything and and well that's that's essentially pantheism God is the sum total of all there is but there's nothing extra of him he doesn't act and God is in fact impersonal this however sets up the pantheist dilemma and the pantheist dilemma is that pantheists keep trying to relate to this God instead of just being part of this God and you have uh Verizon Lisa that I mentioned a few videos ago talking to the universe about whether she wants that that LG lucid phone from Verizon and she's thanks universe and the universe says and by the way Lisa you look particularly lovely today you have Luke Skywalker Obi-Wan says use the force but here's the thing if the universe is fundamentally pantheistic and impersonal any personal being colonizes the impersonal and employs it essentially making the universe less powerful than anyone who can wield it and you have this problem behind every kind of pantheist's conception of God and this and and I find pantheists blow the story again and again and again and in the movie Avatar they blew it as the climax of the movie um Yua has heard us and suddenly Yua was fighting against the great um evil humanoids coming in to get all of the unobtainium or whatever it was they were trying to mine but pantheism a pantheist deity cannot take sides because there are no sides because it's all one now better pantheists actually admit to this and they say the universe is is not personal and neither are you that your experience of personal is illusory and so what you ought to do is get beyond if in fact you can talk ought and again the better pantheists get beyond that say there is no ought there there is only is and the really consistent pantheists wouldn't bother with an argument because there's no point to making an argument because all there is is is there's no ought all there is is is and the quicker you shed the illusion of personal agency the clearer you see but do you actually see because all there is is is but um isn't even this admin adminis assuming um that um assuming that which you assert is an illusion and so to me the pantheist approach really goes nowhere because what's the point once i realize all there is is is there isn't good and evil that that my experience of talking and trying to persuade you is really just an illusion because we're not even choosing either so what's the point and then in a sense the rational thing to do is to go to meditate to to finally absolve myself of the illusion of personal agency and to join the great sea of being in oneness and so on and so forth that's that's essentially at the heart of pantheism but then again none of this makes it you know it just is now then you have the unwise god objection and and that says now let's imagine there was a god and this god is the kind of being that could be responsible for making the universe that god would have to be so amazingly brilliant so amazingly powerful and hopefully moral that's that's always the big question the uh general revelation we could say you could see god's power and you could see god's power but you might have trouble seeing his goodness and in fact i remember i think it's was it um eric weinstein and ben shapiro's video where they talked about that that no it was um ben shapiro talking to prager talking about that god's goodness that's that's the tougher part that you need revelation for we're going to talk about that a little bit too now let's imagine the atheist just for the sake of argument give us a personal supreme deity and the pantheists given to their impulse to talk to it why should such a deity even bother to get involved in the affairs of tiny insignificant creatures such as ourselves it's a good question that's a very good question and comes from an important realization given what we can know about such a being based on what we can see in the universe compared to such beings we are weak stupid petty and reasonably unimportant compared to such a being such a being could reason such a being could reasonably care less about us than we care about the common ants that inhabit the soil around our domiciles just google the amount of ants sometime and how many there are and how all over the place they are and every time we break ground or something people don't stop and say don't kill the ants it's like the ants are not an endangered species we're not really worried about them and when they invade our homes we kill them regularly and we don't give them a thought at least if you're not you know certain religions might want to protect the ants but anyway that we would concern ourselves with a personal relationship with individual ants and get involved in ant drama seems inconceivable well maybe you're a child and you got involved in ant drama for 10 or 15 minutes or maybe you had a little ant house and you were watching it but okay but really ants are not the kind of thing that we can have an interesting relationship with but here's the thing part of the difficulty that we have is via consciousness we are monofocal and I think I think Jonathan Peugeot talks nicely about how in a sense we have order to chaos going out in terms of the in terms of what we see so we're monofocal and and consciousness has this function we can really only pay attention to one thing at a time and and we have to when we have to try and manage two or three things this tiny little slice of our mind that manages our conscious rational self gets really stressed and there's plenty of there's plenty of psychological testing that describes our limitation but a god is not limited to this monofocal consciousness and awareness like we are being involved in taking sides and ant soap operas would be an irresponsible use of our time but doing so for god is hardly a problem because such a god apparently is not limited by the monofocal experience of consciousness that we have so therefore if god for whatever reason wanted to get involved in our little dramas and care about our little thought crimes I suppose he could well am I to tell him he couldn't see god is free to do so if he chooses but he's under no obligation to do so just like when you break ground on in your new office building you're not under any obligation to worry about those ants that you destroyed the first day with the uh with the backhoe a reasonable ant if they understand the qualitative difference between the beings between the being should offer a human being who takes an interest in them a variety of things so let's imagine if an ant could even pay attention to the fact that a human being was taking interest in them what would that ant owe the human being maybe the human being is feeding it now we can scale up to a dog or a cat and have a little bit better understanding but you know an ant would at least should at least owe at least according to our standards respect obedience even worship if I were an ant and I realized I had an experience with a human being as our cats and dogs do I might begin to think well this is a this is a being that I should cultivate a relationship with this being could let's think about my dog this being could potentially feed me every day shelter me protect me give me free health care and in fact give me quite a bit longer of a life than I would have out in the wild and in fact if you look at my dog human beings are extremely responsible for the shape of my little dog my little dog is not would not be found in nature apart from any human being my they tell us that my dog came from wolf stock if there's any dog that's different from a wolf it's my dog so a smart ant would cultivate a relationship with with such a being it would surely be in the ant's best interest to culture relation to cultivate a relationship with a human being especially one that has access to poison and earth moving equipment now let's imagine a human being is capable of getting involved in ant affairs which would be immoral for an ant to make a request of a human being and would it be immoral for the human being to satisfy that request even at the expense of the interests of other ants competing in the ant soap opera drama so you've got a favorite ant and you discover that your favorite ant's colony is at war with the colony two feet over and you decide hey you know what i'd like to do i'm going to get rid of i'm going to get rid of the warring colony and so i do because i can and i don't think i think i don't think a thing of it and all the little ants are like yay we have a relationship with paul vanderclay and he just poisoned the other ant economy he just poisoned the competing ants and then of course some of those ants we might think of course ants we don't believe we don't have any reason to imagine ants have this capacity but some of the ants might say wait a minute if he can if he can destroy them he could destroy us and they might be in a little bit of fear from me and they might think about ways that they'd like to not tick me off and if they start invading my kitchen and i say hey i've made a good relationship with you guys don't invade my kitchen stay on your side of the line well maybe we would none of this is irrational but now we're holding god to a standard we don't hold ourselves to hold ourselves to because we don't have any moral objections to killing ants or disrupting their lives for the most part we have less claim to authority over ants than god has over us because we didn't actually make ants well let's look a little bit at the problem of evil and i was just listening to veritas forum the best of veritas forum as a thing with tim keller on it you can find on youtube veritas forum has avan plantigan and the problem of evil and actually i noticed the i noticed the a so esther esther o'reilly wrote a wrote a pathos piece on jordan peterson under the name young fogie and an atheist wrote a response piece and i noticed they trotted out the problem of evil and as tim keller says the problem of evil isn't really a philosophical objection it's much more of a pastoral objection it's something that we feel because philosophically it really isn't an objection to to that there is a god it isn't a philosophical objection it's an emotional objection but what's another interesting aspect about the problem of evil is it didn't really arrive until the early modern period before then it was known to antiquity but the problem didn't really have pastoral traction until we began to think of ourselves with a little bit more self-importance and at that point we became increasingly offended at what we would imagine the divine would do to us in other words part of what has fueled the concern of the problem of evil has not been so much ideas about god but our ideas about ourself and the elevation of our ideas about ourself and you can read about this in in tim keller's good book on suffering now we have again in the story of hezekiah the god playing charge we have a moral objection that god would grant hezekiah more life on the basis of favoritism this is me killing the neighboring ant colony because my favorite ant lives over here and i'm going to basically change ant history because i like this ant and i like this ant for my own reason and actually that ant probably hasn't done much of anything to earn my allegiance or to demand my trust and the argument basically says that a just god should maintain moral objectivity and if such a god establishes something like a law then god is bound to uphold the law and i think that has a degree of legitimacy hezekiah appeals to god on the basis of his moral performance and attempt to gain relational leverage over that god one i think you one of the things you might notice from the story itself however is that god does not say hezekiah has been so good to me i'm in his debt i'm going to give hezekiah what he wants basically and this is pretty consistent through the old testament god measures his behavior according to himself more than our performance so any law that this god would communicate to smaller creatures to creatures smaller than ants would be in keeping with the desire that that personal god has for its own creation god has ideas about how we should live god has ideas about how we should behave now god would provoke god could communicate to us some of those ideas and laws or give us representations of those ideas via laws but those laws would have to scale to things that we could understand limited by our capacity to understand and by the specific cultures in which we inhabit and that's why again i subscribe to an organic an organic story of the bible organic theory of inspiration that god worked through the cultures and the languages of specific times and places in creating the bible the bible doesn't fall from out of the sky laws that could be managed and communicated to us would likely only be useful approximations of that will of that god of that let's see i get my i try to read this stuff and it never quite comes off well basically the idea is what i just articulated you say well well a good god would give us laws yeah but the but those laws would be limited the representation and articulation of those laws would be limited to our capacity to understand them and to maybe even try to comply with them and i'm not going to get into the slavery conversation but i think there's you can have a good conversation about why didn't god why didn't god just outlaw slavery i think that would be something akin to god outlawing the internal combustion engine and us trying to get rid of it or god outlawing money from now on christians shall not use money go ahead and try this god can in fact pretty much do as he pleases and any objection by ants could of course be heard in his freedom but the capacity of the ants to stand in judgment over such a being is really quite preposterous so the ants of my favorite ant would say who he really shouldn't have wiped out those other ants and i would say yeah i would wipe them out for lesser reasons does that make me less good we can't see that illustration the relationship we have with your dog or your cat the gulf is less than those animals or even your child when you bring them in for vaccination or medical procedure and this gets into tim keller and alvin plantica and many other arguments to kind of blunt the argument the philosophical argument of the problem of evil the fact that you can't think of a good reason why god would allow certain painful things to happen in the world doesn't mean that there can't be good reasons that such a being can have the little ants complaining about how you destroyed their entire community because you wanted to put up an office building well we said tough luck ants we're destroying your habitat so we can build this office building and unlike certain other animals that we have concerns about their you know their rare animals ants are not rare we can lose a whole bunch of ants and we're not really too concerned about it god is free to do what he wants with us in relationship and we should probably assume that no matter how things look on our side of the line god should have the integrity and freedom to do as he pleases whether we regard such things as favorable to us or offensive god's going to do what he wants now a big objection that i would get is you're just making stuff up you don't have any evidence for this okay we're back to evidentialism and well i don't know that we have evidence one way or the other i mean in that way i'm a pretty skeptical person the real objection is that we are just making up stories and that this whole thing is just flights of fancy and that there's no objective truth to an imaginary system that we can employ to move the heart and get the results from the ant god fair enough i have a great deal of sympathy for this objection we want evidence the heart of this objection is that we can turn relating to god into a science and i think this is really where the jordan peterson conversation comes in because again peterson is making an argument from below and he's saying i'm not taking any of this stuff from above i'm simply saying that i have evidence that all of these systems have worked really well for human beings and that it's likely unwise that we throw them away that all of these stories have in fact brought us to a pretty good place so far and he's not excluding rationality he's just saying these stories are playing a more important part in the success that we've experienced as a species than sam harris and others are accounting for but i'd like to turn it around and notice that in many ways this objection is all about our hearts and it's about what we want because what we'd really like is science and as i said before we might hate the idea that god would do this for hezekiah but we dream that there would be such a being who would do it for us and all the little ants are dreaming that they could build a relationship with a human being and our dogs and our cats they don't even have the conscious ability to think this far but in many ways they are far better off often against their will and again i have this all the time every time i take my little dog into the vet which is way too easy which is way too often every time i take my little dog into the vet guess what that little dog hates to go and he hates the vet and he hates the examinations and he hates all of this and if that dog could be given speech well he barks and he complains and he whines and he communicates to me very clearly that he objects to all of this but i walk into the dog i walk into the vet's office with that dog and that vet does all kinds of things to that dog and you know what in my estimation the dog is better for it and it's pretty hard to argue with it now what would my dog like my dog would like for me to be its master and it tries to make me its master all the time and someone might say he arguably does because every time that dog on dog wants to go outside he goes to the door and he paws on the window and i get my lazy butt off the couch watching tv and i slide that door open and i slide it closed to keep out the mosquitoes then the dog wants to come back in and i slide it open and i slide it shut and i do this how many times and i pay real money for that dog to go to the vet and i pay real money to feed that dog and on and on and on and on and on and so you begin to wonder who's governing who well what that dog would really like is to turn the relationship into science and what we really hate about the hezekiah story is that hezekiah gets what he wanted and when i prayed for a loved one god didn't answer could there be a motivation at work here we don't want people praying unless it works because if for a minute we could turn this prayer thing into a science believe you me all of this objection would go away and we would use it as much as we could that's really what's at the heart of this when i say a science i mean a system that we can employ to first predict and then ensure that's technology basically the outcomes we desire what this in fact um what this does is in fact depersonalize god this is why this is the attraction of pantheism because we as persons would have power over it the power to colonize it reducing god and making god subject making god subject to our wills and desire this is not much different from the way many pantheists cheat their system the perfect pantheist finally surrenders their agency because in their system it itself must be illusory and behavior consistent with such a worldview rationality is a consistency effort practices the deconstruction of one's personal will and one's personal agency rationally your ethics should align with your with your larger worldview even if hezekiah believes that god has placed hezekiah in his debt god is under no obligation to act as if he's in hezekiah's debt one way or another now my little dog probably many ways imagines that i am in his debt but i do not feel in the debt of my dog in to the least and much to my family's fear there will come a day when i'll go to the vet and the vet says i'll save your dog for ten thousand dollars and i'll say you know i love my little dog but i'm putting the dog down because i cannot afford a ten to ten thousand ten thousand dollar vet bill i'm gonna put my little dog down then you'd say well i don't believe you i've done it before and i'll do it again why because it's rational but what does my little dog think of this well we don't know really but we can imagine pretty well what my little dog thinks of this my little dog would love me to be his love me to be his master to love to have a master as as powerful as a human being is with as much capacity as i have then we see this with children the same thing happens with toddlers and a parent a parent might relent to the toddler's plea but the parent is never really in the toddler's debt god remains free to do as he wants and we remain small and this we really hate now should god manage the universe in a way that will yield clear and consistent results let's say god would say okay i'm going to institute a new regime of giving people exactly what they want when they ask for it and again i would recommend reading c.s lewis's the great divorce because in c.s lewis's picture hell is a place that you get everything you ask for just by thinking of it every prayer is answered but the one thing you can't do is violate someone else's will which is why heaven is this or hell is this enormous city that just keeps growing and everyone keeps moving further and further and further away from each other in increasingly fabulous houses getting everything they want but the one thing that they can't stand is each other so should god manage the universe in a way that would give clear and consistent results let's say god would say watch and you can even watch um what was that jim carrey movie where where um uh bruce almighty there you go god just decides he's gonna grant every he's gonna grant every prayer well this would be problematic for reasons that it shouldn't take too long for us to see but what if god assuming i'm right about this made it so that prayer for people get what they want if such a thing could be measured on a consistent on a consistent basis so that prayer works to a degree that even sam harris would start to pray for a lamborghini or whatever is or for whatever it is he wanted and and this is an interesting question because would it be in god's interest to do so or would this simply make us more mercenary and would this in fact poison the kind of relationship that we can without too much difficulty imagine god would like to have with us this gets into jordan peterson's ideas about sacrifice because peterson says that people saw that sacrifice work and this is complicated for peterson because sacrifice is tied to delaying gratification and engagement with the future beyond animals and the future is filled with people so you have shared rationality religion is a powerful adaptive force in the development of human culture so why should we imagine that now we don't need it anymore that's at the heart peterson's objection but what would it take and would god would it in fact be in god's interest to answer all of our prayers or at least a sufficient quantity of our prayers so that they number one wouldn't be hurtful to others and number two would give us a clear and consistent pattern that even atheists would have to go back and say yep we should pray well first we don't actually know whether this practice whether this prayer of jordan peterson's sacrifice really works it's terribly difficult to run an experiment partly because for an experiment to work you would have to make sure that god would be blind to your experiment well what do you mean by that well imagine a group of kids trying to run such an experiment on the manipulation of their parents so you've got some siblings and they get together and they say you know i really noticed that dad is vain and so when we say sweet things to dad dad you look good today oh you're such a good father oh we're so thankful that we tend to get what we want more so we as children are basically going to conspire and work on dad's vanity to get our requests answered more often well this might go for a while depending on the vanity of your father it might work pretty well but once your father figures out that this is a game and that you're not actually authentically praising him but you're manipulating him the deal is done because your father doesn't want to have a relationship like this with you and if he does he's not a very good father so you'd have to keep you'd have to keep this experiment blind to god well there you have a problem once the parents knew what the kids were up to the parents would then start to mess with the results according to their will so if the kids think that they can play on me with my vanity well once i know this now i'm going to think the other way and then we're into spy versus spy and we're into reasons why it's um terribly hard to predict the stock market because it's filled with human beings so is god managing us well if i had an ant friend i'd manage that i manage my dog i manage my cat i managed my children and they were they're a whole lot smarter now but they're not quite as smart as me because i'm old and i've seen a few things and they don't watch my videos well we have reason to believe that god might not wish to run the universe in such a way that he would be that he would be subject to our whims in some sort of compulsory way compulsory way compulsively whabbit parents can for their own sake make themselves subject to the whims of a child but the good and responsible parent would never make themselves ultimately subject to those whims and i don't make myself ultimately subject to the whims of my dog now we get into my calvinism how long is this it's about an hour that's not too bad god is holy holy and unimaginably free and to me this is utterly rational now can i prove it no because it's built on my presuppositions but to me given the christian presuppositions god is far beyond what we can imagine because the deeper we watch again that neil degrasse tyson video the deeper we dig into knowledge the more we realize we don't know and the cosmological argument that there is a designer continues to have pull on me does it prove anything i don't know what we can prove but to me the universe seems like such a place that wow it is amazing it is complex it seems designed and fine-tuned but such a being capable of that is degrees different from myself to my toddler and myself to my dog and myself to ants and so to the degree that any such being would like to relate to me that's on that being and not me he can destroy me about as quickly as any youth earth mover destroys an ant colony that's just the way it seems to me and to me this is utterly rational we are small and have zero capacity to put god in our debt and if you go back and you listen to the history of my sermons you'll hear this theme again and again and again because i think just as it's built into my dog just as it's built into the toddlers just as it's built into my children just as it's built into almost any human relationship one of the things that husbands and wives are continually wrestling about and what the old testament says who is is what is our relationship with god we wrestle with god what are we always trying to do we're trying to put god in my debt because i want to put a being like god in my debt so that i can be god because if i can put god in my debt and if i can have a special relationship with god and if i get in a fix then god can get me out moralistic therapeutic deism look it up and we are offended by the idea that king hezekiah would lay there and isaiah would say yeah you're gonna die and hezekiah would turn to the wall and say i don't want to die and god would listen to him and god would say okay isaiah go back and tell him you get 15 more why is this offensive because we asked and didn't get anymore because the universe seemed to hurt us at the moment of our need and when i look at it this way what do i see i see what is consistently human that we are petty small creatures who don't know squat about just about anything this is how we are and so the idea that we could have a relationship with a god who would listen to us and care about us well this is attractive is that an argument why it might all be fantasy you bet it is i might be fooling myself i get that but to me none of this is irrational to me all this is plenty rational from where i started and i again i don't have any hope in their rational project in fact we've been working the system of rationality for thousands of years now any ability to relate to such a being is completely dependent upon this being's his desire to do so consider the ant this being owes us nothing that is a terrifying thought the universe the world is a terrifying place the world is a terrifying place we have zero possibility to put god in our debt we are trying to do and trying to do so is believably offensive when your toddler tries to put you when you're dead in his debt it's kind of cute because you're old enough to know when your teenager does it it becomes a learning experience to reinforce to the teenager you know i love you i'm good to you i take care of you i'm sacrificing a lot for you um don't try to pull those strings on me when your adult children do it that gets really offensive because they should know better but we do it all the time to each other we do it to our spouses look at almost any marital situation look at almost any intimate human situation it's this ongoing tug of war of trying to put the other in our debt so that we can have control and turn the other people into a science so we can turn them into piano keys so we can play them but the thought that we ourselves as our piano keys whichever you system you come at this from that's offensive to us we don't like it we hate it we don't want it so what's our motivation we have zero possibility to put god in our debt trying to do so is believably offensive we don't like it when our children do it to us so there you have hezekiah's illness god is free in the situation consistently he can change his mind or even just appear to change his mind he is not indebted to our systems of thinking about him because our systems are always represented represent are always representations and attempts at approximating even god revealing himself john calvin says this he has to accommodate himself to us to talk with us within a frame of reference look at my dimensions videos about video about flatland when you think about how i need to condescend to train my dog why because my dog has limited bandwidth because and and it's it's even hard for me because god sees through us in a way that i can't see through my dog but look at the degree of power between myself and my dog bigocre says we have about the dog's brain has about as many neurons as we have in our guts okay yeah look at how much we have to condescend and i don't mean that in the emotional sense i mean that in the more historical sense we have to condescend to talk to my dog no no sit stay i can't even do that with an ant think about what god has to do to talk to us and yeah you're objecting to a bible that was written to another culture a culture you can hardly understand the miracle is that anything works at all and again this is part of the reason i like peterson he makes that point again and again and i think he's dead right that's the miracle the miracles that any of this works the miracle is that we would even imagine or try to have a relationship with a being like this most of our ancestors didn't even bother trying because even that seemed too audacious and ambitious god is free in the situation completely he can change his mind or even appear to change his mind we don't know and it's pointless to judge what's god's concern might we imagine not to make the people more mercenary in their relationship with him not to encourage the manipulation which is so inherent in us you know you think about the fact that the atheists say religious belief is irresponsible i understand the point i really do have got a lot of sympathy for them but you think about how irresponsible it is on god's part to relate to us at all you know if you relate to animals at all then maybe keep them wild but to relate to us at all why what what does he want to do with us well he wants to make us better well what would be the definition of better well the only definition we can come up with is more like him what do we do with our pets what do we do with our children we want to make them more like us we don't want to destroy their individuality but we want to make our children both more like us but in the individual way and this parent child this this human dog this human ant these analogies just keep working and scaling with respect to this but he wants us to relate to him freely and that we know ourselves to be what we are he doesn't want us to have pretenses about you know we can construct this world and again peterson reads this i think correctly in the bible that we are full of pretense and these this pretense is in fact dangerous what he really wants is for us to learn to trust and find his joy well what's going on on our side it's all trust and control we lack trust and we want control and again i'll assert we're not so much asserted that offended that has a kya that that there would be a situation that someone would pray and their prayers would be answered but that ours aren't we are so dramatically self-interested we so want the world to be as we imagine it should be we lack trust and we want control but how trustworthy are we what exactly are we trying to secure can't answer those questions so this is there's about an hour and 12 minutes of of ranty video but those are random scattered thoughts as i as i think about the hezekiah story and i think about the jordan peterson sam harris sam harris conversation and again for me this is why do i keep talking about this why do i keep making these videos well this is just how i'm wired maybe i'm you know not in control of myself nearly as much as i imagine i am but when i read the hasekiah story i thought this is exactly the kind of thing that you know if i wanted to sit down and debate an atheist i'd say let's start with this story it would be just let's softball just a lob softball over the middle of the plate because here it's got all the elements and they'd say surely a rational person can't believe this and on one hand i completely understand their complaints because i see it all the time but yet on the other hand i don't find it irrational at all i don't know how they're going to change me to this vaught to this lauded rationality that's supposed to dispel god and every part of magical thinking that steve jobs lost his life over but here we are
