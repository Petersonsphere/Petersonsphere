 Hi, this is Paul and as you might have noticed on my channel over the last week or so There's been sort of the equivalent of reruns I've been posting material from other channels that have done and a lot of conversations that I had stored up and done in a little While that's because I've been out of town or sort of out of town or sort of on vacation for a little while Last week today is Today is Tuesday. So a week ago Not last Sunday, but the week before on Sunday I took off My wife and I took off for Salt Lake City I had a church meeting to do and then I was gonna head down to southern Utah for a week of vacation but when I was in Salt Lake I got a message from my mother that my aunt had died and I got a message from a member of the church that her husband had taken a turn for the worse and instead of being on vacation But not actually being on vacation or being two days away from anything exploring canyons or whatnot in the desert of southern Utah decided to postpone the vacation and just head home and so that's what I've been doing visiting the member of the church who's been ill and Keeping close contact with my mother since the death of my sister you know, it's it's a Grief is a cumulative thing. And so it's important to to keep tabs on your loved ones when In our family we've had three pretty significant funerals over the last two years And then I know that that might not sound like a lot to some of you but death death does Grieving is cumulative. So I haven't I've been busy with other things. So I haven't put out any new content We're into August. My wife is a school teacher And so August is get ready for September month and so she'll be doing that and so Hopefully be making some new videos So while I've done this I've also as many of you have noticed taking a pause and pause the Calendly things there haven't been Hardly any open slots. And so I've been doing some reflecting on the channel on conversations on a on a whole number of things One of the things that one of the things that's a reality I wrote a I wrote a piece on CRC voices this morning that reflected on some of this one of the things that you know in The channel is maturing and and what that means is that in some ways the the bloom is off the rose and people are speaking Their own minds a little bit more freely Some people have lost interest and left others are have settled in that tends to happen with people over time and so There's been you know, a little bit more criticism which which is is actually I think a good thing If you have all positive comments and all positive conversation and we're probably not speaking truthfully to one another So, you know debating something disagreeing with something, you know, especially with with ideas is Important and so challenging one another. That's a that's a good thing and you know, I've been weighing this and Figuring things out. I try to I don't read every comment on the channel, but every day if I've got time I usually try to go through and read the comments and part some of them and reply to some of them And again, I think that the channel has matured. I've been doing this for a little over a year and a half now the whole dynamic of explored versus unmapped territory a lot of the you know, the I Think about that often when we do the conversations because when there's a new person on There's automatically questioned the new person is unexplored territory and who are they and have they been in the comments? section and today I put the I posted the conversation that I had a little while ago with was Sylvan bear and I really like as Some of you have noticed I really like having conversations with people who are regulars in the comments section because then we see their face and People in terms of their persona in comments. It's always a little different than their persona you know on video and we were different people when we're talking through our fingers than when we're talking through our mouths and To see a bigger fuller picture of the person is is usually a welcome thing. And so I want to keep doing conversations and and not just conversations with people who are College professors or authors or experts but doing conversations with random people as folks have said in the channel and And I want to keep bringing new people in and some people have noted well There's a repetition to some of these conversations and something sometimes these conversations are dull and I don't care to listen to them And that's absolutely fine. Nobody I certainly don't expect People to have to listen to every video I post I try with the conversations to put some indication in the title of What the conversation is about those of you who've been having conversations with me know that I I try to take notes during the Conversation which is which is sort of challenging but but a good thing because often I'll post the Conversations days or even weeks sometimes going on a month after We've had the conversations and so the notes Remind me of what we talked about and prompt me to to think about it without necessarily having to rewatch the conversations I don't often rewatch the conversations I had because I was there the first time, you know, maybe I should So so I've done a lot of thinking about the conversations and why should I do them and what are they for and You know I very much understand the surprise that a lot of people have when they you know You talk to anyone who wants to talk to you and I know I don't clear or vet my conversations I don't do them live there are conversations that I have with people that that should not be posted and I won't post them and and As I'm having more and more conversations Sometimes now I don't post a conversation because I think we've sort of talked about that before on the channel and and so sometimes I I won't I Won't post a conversation for that reason just because we have a conversation doesn't mean, you know, you get to come on the channel It's it's always an opt-in from both sides. And so if I decide to not post a conversation I have with you There's no There's no judgment about that at all it doesn't mean I I like you less or like you more or anything like that It's it's much more effective. I just thought about it and didn't think it was appropriate or fit now Often when I have a conversation with someone there will be things that they say that Rest somewhere in the back of my mind and later on I'll pull it up And so if you if you had given me permission to share the conversation Then I might take little clips of it and play them. Well, we'll see how it goes I keep any Conversation that someone agrees that someone allows and gives me permission to record but not share I've still got those conversations and so some of you I know Decided not to share the conversation and I certainly honor that sometimes I disagree with it But I honor it and so if you change your mind I've still got the conversation and we can share it and if you never change your mind, that's okay, too conversations Often are just between two people and that's a very appropriate thing. But what are they for? The conversations are for a lot of things I think the conversations part of my motivation for the conversations has always been this posture that I've had which is a long-standing and rather deep thing for me that people matter and In our strange culture right now We have this attitude that that sometimes the only people that matter are the ones on screens The ones on the television screens are the ones who make the newspapers which are now viewed on screens And and I think there's something deeply wrong to that And and so I welcome a technology like YouTube that says well anybody can be on screen But then we have the dynamic of a lot of people are putting themselves on the screen and nobody's watching and then so they don't Feel validated my goal isn't necessarily to validate people by putting them on my channel the fact that my channel has had whatever numerical success it's had I frankly attribute to the fact that Through no planning of my own. I started making videos about Jordan Peterson at exactly the right time and the channel grew and That is just how it is And so I know a number of you don't watch the conversations and you're probably not going to listen to this one Because of that but I Do share the conversations because as we've seen and really as we've sort of stumbled into a community as such has developed And as a pastor, I'm very interested in that So so I like the conversations that I'm gonna keep doing the conversations and some of you can keep skipping the conversations or or Picking them which is absolutely appropriate. Not everybody has I almost wind up posting an Hour six days a week that's sort of my rhythm lately and I'll probably try to keep to that You know, I'm not everybody has an hour six days a week that they want to spend on this and if you just want To watch a video I do on Jordan Peterson or John Verbeke or or Jay or Nathan Jacobs or or Rod Hugen or someone else? That's that's totally cool but I do value the conversations and you know, it's funny because I you know might be the most of the videos my mother watches Are the conversations and when I noticed that I you know it really made me reflect on the fact that people do find other people interesting and and via my Having a conversation with someone that adds a certain layer of expectation that the conversation will be about something and in such and such a way and and that I think contributes to the fact that that people will take a chance on listening to it and I you know, I think the conversations have really been a blessing They've been a blessing to me and I know a number of people have Have created new friendships in the comment section and because of the conversation and again as with the the Sylvan bear Conversation that I posted today. It's it's something special to see someone in person It broadens them and now when you have an exchange in the comment section well, there's there's more to it you have a sense of the person and then the the other Conversations via email or Twitter or you know like between Job and Esther and Jeff and Luke And frozen Texan and and a whole bunch of people, you know these are these are really special and this is part of the reason why I like doing the meetups too because at least in Sacramento there's another whole side of it because a number of the people in the Jordan Peterson meetup in Sacramento watch many of my Videos and so we'll talk about the characters who show up in in my videos often in the in the meetup meeting So so this is a part of the channel that is increasingly costly to maintain as I'm able to get more and more conversations with Experts and professionals and and I welcome that too. I welcome that nature but but I also want to keep the conversations with Regular people because here's the truth the the experts in the college professors I talked to are not necessarily more worth talking to than the people whose name nobody knows and one of the things I've been amazingly Impressed by in the comment section. It's just how many smart people are out there leaving great comments and insights and so I Didn't know a YouTube channel could be like this, but I've certainly been blessed by it I want to say a thing that's something about intramural Christian debates Part of what happens there's a college humor video that that Christian people are nerds and they're basically nerds fighting about their fandom in Some ways similar to to Star Wars fans or Star Trek fans You know which which Star Wars movies are canonical and which Star Wars Movies are apocryphal in which Star Wars movies should never been made and maybe everything post Disney isn't Is a catastrophe or whatever Anything that lodges deep in our heart is Something we're going to fight over and so Christians will have disputes with each other Over language and then that's important because language is a vital aspect of how we communicate with one another and so having debates about words and formulations and doctrines All of this is a normal and I think healthy part about Christian community and and so I'm when it comes to When it comes to moderating a comment section, I always err on On the Liberty side. I'm I will I think in the whole time. I've had this channel. I've only blocked two people and I've only deleted two or three comments section comments and And in many in in every case it was because the person was not Contributing but obviously and maliciously attempting to destroy community and conversation and that I won't tolerate I will allow people to get into things between each other and even sometimes have their feelings hurt A degree of name-calling I won't tolerate we should be debating ideas. You can go You can go with everything you've got after an idea because it doesn't bleed but People are image bearers of God and so we we debate ideas and we're Generous and kind and hopefully gentle towards people Now when it comes to tribal markers in Christian communities Again having a Christian tribe is a natural thing we all need a tribe and part of being a tribe is defending your tribe and part of defending your tribe and a Christian theological context is is taking on other ideas and challenging them and and participating in that but There's a degree to which especially in a in an open forum can be damaging to the the witness and Evangelistic posture of the church and I know I'll have conversations with people with whom I disagree and and in fact, I may disagree quite strongly With many of the opinions they share and they'll share opinions and say things on my channel that I won't challenge I don't make apology for that. Well, maybe I make an apology for that right now, but The reason for that is quite frankly patience It isn't I don't need to challenge every idea or everything that I disagree with or think is wrong or even dangerous at every moment at every time and the reason I don't do that is because I think people quite frankly do more changing as they talk their way through things and and part of talking someone talking their way through things means Just just letting them talk letting them put things on the table letting conversations go for long periods of time You know, I've learned this through years of pastoral Conversations I often find pastors wait in way too fast with answers with Admonitions with corrections. There are points and places and times for that seldom Are they in public which is part of the reason I won't do that much on my channel Now there may be conversations where that's sort of the sport and we're going to have a debate and so I'll go at it But especially in one-to-one conversations with people with whom I haven't spoken much I am NOT going to challenge or contest or debate or correct very often and if for you That just right raises your blood pressure You're probably not going to be long on this channel because I'm not going to stop this And the reason I'm not going to stop this is because again, I believe people matter to God and I believe What it takes for people? To do things and to work things out is often a long time of conversation and that's part of the reason why We do spend time. I do spend time on this channel doing conversation now If it comes to the point that I have to start a sub channel with just conversations, maybe I'll do that I don't know that's not for now. And so what I've done is I've I've got some guidelines for conversations. I thought about Changing the link but I haven't done that yet. So everyone who has the link has the link. It's not a huge secret You can get it if you subscribe to me on patreon, which I haven't followed very closely lately So my apologies if you've tried to send me a message through patreon Twitter's I lately I've been checking Twitter as often I've been as I've been checking everything I'm kind of snowed in in terms of email. So if I missed your email, I'm very sorry. Don't be offended It's it's nothing intentional if you wrote me a long one with complicated questions. Oh Boy, it's There's a lot of questions. I can't answer But you know part of the reason I do the conversations is because I'm a pastor That's that's that's an identity that I possess and I help people curate and manage their stories my flock You know, the YouTube channel is not a church. I say that all the time But but in many ways anyone who comes to me because of my Christian beliefs about image-bearers I have to try to treat with respect and and so my flock has gotten far larger than the Hundred or so people that used to come, you know used to be my flock here at Little Living Stones People are complex and in Christianity people as people have a privileged status And that's why we should debate ideas and not go after people But that's part of the what I'm having to sort through it work through in this and Pastors build communities and so one of the things I want to do with this channel is in fact build communities and I hear from many of you that you're having email conversations or Twitter conversations or Facebook conversations or even just Having Skype or zoom offline and talking to people and meeting to people and and Job was hosting frozen Texan and Jeff hosted Job and on and on and I love that this is happening That's part of the reason I started meetups because there's something about face-to-face communication and more frequent contact that knits communities Together and friendships and I believe these are the spaces in which God says does some of his most important work So so I love Developing networks of relationships and I part of the thing that you learn as a pastor is They keep the relationships can't always go through me Even in a small church as small as Living Stones If someone is coming to the church and they're coming because they want to talk to me or have a relationship with me It's not going to work They need to develop relationships within the body of Christ and the pastor is is always sort of an a special piece on the board in the body But he's not a substitute for the body and the whole body can't go through him and so the church needs to have relationships Apart and so I'm gratified by hearing about relationships that are you know Maybe beginning in the comment section or beginning in conversations and and flourishing and developing online in different ways That's a wonderful thing, but the channel is not a church But it but it can be sort of a community and I want to foster and facilitate But I don't control it and I don't want to control it and what that means is that some of you will meet with some Of the others of you but not others of you and that's natural and and I don't I understand it and I don't I Don't necessarily encourage it because I'm pretty open but but also I don't discourage it It's we all have natural affinities towards some people and not towards other people and so I want to avoid click ishness or Subgroups necessarily the channel is small enough right now And I pastor a small church that it's good for people to to do not develop too many Shoot from the hip biases towards one another often based on well They're an atheist or they're a Christian or they're a Jungian or they're a Buddhist or or they're a Republican or they're a Democrat I think all of those identity elements should be a bit down Even though they're fundamental I'm obviously a Christian and a Christian minister We are all still image-bearers and if you're a Christian Jesus tells us Jesus commands us to love our neighbor as ourselves all the way up to and including our enemies And so if you're a Christian you've got an even higher bar of treatment Towards others which means not quickly taking offense and not not quickly condemning someone for their theological position or theological posture So I'm going to I'm going to talk about some conversation types And I want my conversations to sort of sort of fall into these and these are Reflecting on the conversations that I've had I want to continue to have first time conversations with people That aren't necessarily paying me money That's important to me and in these conversations Like you'll see I mean those of you have watched a lot of conversations know the routine. What's your story? Why do you want to talk to me and and a lot of this is what's your faith story? Or maybe your story of unbelief. Why did you walk away from the church? Why can't you believe in God? Why do you believe in God but have problems with him or her or it or however you characterize God to be? Let me hear your faith story. What is it? What was it like growing up? Did your did your do were your parents Christians? Did you leave the church? Are you still in the church? Are you struggling with church? I'm a pastor and these are the kinds of stories that I think are not only important to me But important for Christians to hear and so I value these stories And so as long as I can and to the degree that I can I want to keep this sort of unvetted Conversations open because what they mean is that I talk to people that I would never choose to talk to But but if you're coming to me and listening to my channel There's there's something that is you're trying to work out in your head or if I use Christian language What God is doing in your life? And so I want to keep space for these conversations So what is your story? What are you struggling with for me as a pastor? This is basic research What's going on in the world in the zeitgeist? I learned this by listening to people and I want to share it because it's data for all of us there are pastors who listen to my channel and and For many for many pastors this kind of information especially talking to Especially talking to people who don't go to church or are not Christians or anti-christian I value those conversations often more than the conversations I have with deeply wonderful Christian people and many of you I've spoken with are wonderful deeply Christian people, but You're already a Christian and I want to talk to people who aren't I want to know what they're thinking About I want to know why they care. I want to know why they're listening to me. So I'm gonna keep Space open for those people. And so if you've had two or three conversations with me, you know I don't get to that in a minute. Hold back let the first timers through some of you some of you have got it down in terms of how to get a slot and Okay, but but other folks really want to talk to me and they haven't had the chance And so if you talk to me two or three times my recommendation is going to be find two or three other people who have spoken to me to and find a date with a group just like Jeff and Job and looped it and then we'll have a group conversation and Or maybe have a group conversation without me and edit it down to maybe you know post post the conversation on another channel And then edit it down and maybe I'll post a highlight video something like that We'll work something out please leave room for the first timers for those who have just come on this channel and heard something and want to talk to me and I've seen that I talked to other random people and Don't crowd them out and that's you know Not saying that they're little children, but when Jesus says suffer the little let the little children come to me Because to them belong the kingdom of heaven, you know those who are And that's that's why I started this channel because as a pastor I get so little opportunity to Talk to people unfiltered so Don't be a filter that these people are having a hard time getting to me I want to know about your Jordan Peterson meeting crisis journey And then I'll be doing some videos about the relationship new Jordan Peterson in the meeting crisis You know this I I have an evangelistic project. I'm very open I want just like me and Bishop Barron have this in common I want more people to discover faith in Christ But I'll certainly be your friend if you're an atheist and think Christianity is a bunch of hooey I will still be your friend. I will still love you. I will still respect you. I still want to talk to you in fact I probably want to talk to you more than I want to talk to some of my Christian brothers and sisters because I I Lots of reasons that I just talked about I'm not a controller. I'm a pastor slash gardener. I'm not a machinist I'm not looking to stamp out cookie-cutter Christians And you know I get some teasing sometimes that I'm you know Partly because of the Jordan Peterson dynamic and my conversations with John. Oh, you're so pro-orthodox I'm a Christian Reformed pastor But but if someone says to me, you know, I I've started going to an Orthodox Church I'll encourage them. I'll say go so That's what I'm gonna be and again, I'm not gonna play Christian tribal games here I really don't want to play that I certainly can I could certainly argue for my positions, but That's not mainly what I want to do here So and I want data on this Jordan Peterson movement And so it's very interesting for me to hear about this is how you found Jordan Peterson This is the changes that he made and now that he's sort of receding You know, we'll see if he comes back when his second book comes and if he does a book tour or the next biblical series well, we'll see what happens to Jordan's story, but I Still want data on what's going on because right away. I thought this is an important movement and so updates if if you've had a few conversations with me and you want to do another one send me an email and and And let me know kind of what you're thinking about Maybe we can find a splot a flop plus splot flop a slot or something like that These are pastoral conversations and yes, I'd like to I'd like you to become a Christian I'm just trying to share a good thing as the color purple says But no, I won't violate you or force you and I can't make you become a Christian or believe in God that much should be Obvious to any regular listeners of the channel and there are relational idea projects, you know I've really enjoyed my conversations with Nick and I hope to have more conversations with Nick about about his I want Nick to start his own channel, but We'll see we'll see what Nick does Nick has so many interesting ideas and and there are others that You know, I talked to burn and I want to have some more conversations with burn and them and some people I'm seeking out Like John Verveke and Nathan Jacobs and I've got a few more that'll be coming on to the channel soon that you know I'll be having conversations. So, you know, it's it's a it's a personal channel it's a real mishmash of things and so, you know part of what I find so lamentable is that I There are too many people in too many ideas and so what that means is that there'll be some things I'm more interested in than other things and And those things will hit the top of my hierarchy and other things won't so Don't take it personally maybe, you know, maybe at some point you and I will Find we're both interest in a particular ideas You can tell ideas go through my purview pretty quickly. And so who knows maybe a time will come but I'll leave places for that in the channel. And so if you propose a topic to me, you know I might I might say yes or I might say no But try doing some group conversations I thought the conversation with with Job and Jeff and Luke went very well And if I've spoken you and I have spoken a couple of times try and find two or four others Who I've spoken with I know Julian is often up for a conversation. Job is often up Cassidy and Ryan are up for conversation. There's a lot of folks who haven't shown up for a conversation yet I'm sure Mary would be in I'm sure Esther would be in You know find some people who've been on the channel and see if you can make contact with them and ask them if they'd like To do a follow-up conversation and then talk about what you guys want to talk about and send me an email say this is kind Of what we'd like to talk about and then look for a slot Yeah, be precise and when we do this and I'm the last one who should say anything about this so ramble so insufferably sometimes be precise and economic with your language in your comments and And that'll we'll see if we can get a conversation with three or four people done in an hour or an hour and a half Well, we'll see how that goes Start up your own channel Karen's done this and I think she's done some good things And she's talked to a number of the people from this channel pursue the conversation and and yeah if you start your own channel I appreciate the fact that that the algorithm might not pick up on you now There's some ways that you can maybe help your case You know if you if you put my name in the in the tag section if you you know There's various ways you can work on the algorithm so that if if someone sees My channel, maybe Google will prompt your conversation Drop come into the conversation on our channel and put a link in so that someone might be able to find it You know, I I have in many ways my channel got started because of Jordan Peterson If you build a channel bigger than mine based on my name God bless you and You know, I'm not gonna be greedy about this kind of thing That's the way it is. So, you know, I might not have you colonize a Conversation that we have and but what I mean by that is you have a whole bunch of ideas and I have a platform And you want to kind of throw them out there now sometimes I'll initiate conversations with other people where I want to get them to throw their ideas out But you know start your own channel and start your own podcast and get your ideas out there and who knows maybe you'll get 10,000 a hundred thousand a million subscribers in a year do it. I'd love to see you do it and I think it's a I think it's a cool thing about YouTube and I don't know how much longer YouTube will be this way. So so You know have a have a disposition towards action Start a discord server and invite some people you'd like to engage with Joey who I had a conversation has is Playing around with some of these ideas and he and Tyler who've been in some of my conversations at my local meetup They're working on them connect with people network put something together do something build something You know go for it and feel free to invite me. I might jump in if I can I'll try to do that Now monetization this is something I don't talk about often because I don't like to forefront it Part of you know, I'd make no Bones about the fact that I pastor a little church and what that means the little church is always sort of on the edge And this church has been on the edge probably for Most of the 20 years I've been here. They've never missed a paycheck, which is a wonderful thing But you know, it's it's a it's a dying little congregation and ministry always has a financial aspect and so you know everything last December when Jordan Peterson and and Dave Rubin pulled out of patreon, you know I kind of watched Jonathan Peugeot to see what Jonathan does and Jonathan didn't pull out. He started the he started the subscribed star, but that then had issues I've just kind of been waiting on this because this isn't a this isn't a primary income generator for me It might have to pull more weight in the future I don't know that depending on what happens here on the ground in terms of living stones and its financial situation Some people over the last years have written checks and sent them to living stones, which which has been a very generous thing Some of you have supported me on patreon, which has been a generous thing Sometimes some of you have sent me money on PayPal. I even put Bitcoin links in there and I When all this stuff was going on at the turn of the year and I thought well Bitcoin's a great way to send money without any Trying to get it between nations so if you're if you're not in the US and you want to some and you want to support me and you're Kind of a tech person and can figure out how to use cryptocurrency I take Bitcoin. So there you go But you know, I'm continuing to think about this and I know Jordan Peterson is we're gonna roll out think spot I'm gonna take a look at that and Some other vendors have actually been approaching me lately. My channel's not real big But I guess it's big enough to get on the list for some people and so Looking at some platforms by which there could be more Community and and support and one of the things I think about in terms of a a sub channel or a pay or a Behind a paywall channel what might be instant release of agreed to Conversations might be extra things. I noticed that Jonathan Jonathan Peugeot has now started new things on his I don't even support him on patreon I should because I just have some Ambivalences about some of these things so So, yeah, I'm gonna try and figure that out and so But but again the main the main thing is I don't want money to stand in the way of Random conversations with people because maybe it's my Spiritual commitments, but the Holy Spirit can do surprising things And if you want to if you want to De-christianize that statement and talk about randomness or something be my guest, but I don't want money to be Kind of the the way that people The way that I manage a crowd having said that I might do something Like Jonathan is done and like Jordan used to do in terms of Support at a certain amount. I haven't I haven't had a lot of people do that Support at a certain amount. I haven't I haven't made those decisions yet, but You know, we'll see what happens with living stones in the budget this year every year budget is kind of like, you know what's what's budget gonna look like and But that's you know, many of you who are part of churches know that that's a normal part of church every year Oh, did we make budget this year? Oh, we didn't make budget this year. So how does that affect them here at little living stones? My salary is Most of the budget so I mean the building is paid for and there aren't a lot of programs and so My salary is most of the budget. So most of the money that comes here goes to me one way or another. So So i'm thinking about monetization and think spot and all of those things I'm thinking about doing some writing I've been thinking about that for years But ideas are getting a little clear in my mind and now actually with with a little bit of a platform if I would write a book Probably You know would do okay. So I I gotta I gotta figure all that stuff out So I am going to reopen the calendly link. I know a lot of you have written me and said There's no slots. There's no slots. No, there's no slots because it was closed down and um, i'm gonna reopen it Don't all rush in um, I didn't change the link and so I'm gonna wait a day or two after I release this to reopen it and i'm gonna Probably do it at some random hour, you know Like a thief in the night and and open up a few slots in the next coming weeks Not a lot just a few and again pay attention to the new guidelines I'm going to put a link in the notes here. I put the guidelines up in written form on my blog and um again if if uh leave room for first timers if you and I have spoken already and um, If you if you have spoken and get a group together And and let's do a group conversation and if we can do that we can sort of economize and get more people through You know, there was a saying um Saying that I picked up from people some people when you invite guests over to the house and Actually sunday I was a little behind in posting my sunday school sermons my sunday school lessons too on the other channel I do have a church channel that's separate from this channel where I do my sermons and my sunday school classes And I happen to think some of you might enjoy my sunday school classes Because some of you might notice a lot of peterson stuff sneaks into those but but family hold back and and so that's sort of the that's sort of the the message I want to give here because um if if you're uh committed if you watch all my videos and this is a really important thing for you Then and I know you want to talk to me and gosh I love talking to people that i've already established a friendship with and we can talk a lot but new people Need to be able to get through And and we need to be able to add new people to the mix and that means family hold back Group up get a group of you together And if I can talk to two or three of you at once get yourselves a little organized think about what you want to talk about Let me know You know, we'll see how that goes and we'll see if we can get more people through the channel again my you know, it's one video six days a week pretty much is my rhythm and And we'll see we'll see if we can do this. So Again, all of you who have been supporting my channel. I mean some of you have sent money every month I'm humbled and um Embarrassed in a good way and and thank you because the The the little extra the little extra money that that that brings in Hey, i've got five kids two in college this year. Um, it all helps, of course I I don't but I don't want that to be what this channel is about and i'm very sensitive about those things because Christian many Christian ministry can so easily become simony simony is is ministry for pay and If there's anything You didn't have to pay $150 to spend an hour with jesus And you shouldn't have to pay $150 to spend an hour with me So that's that's part of my conviction about the way the world should work So if we've had a conversation family hold back leave room for some other people if uh, in fact if you jump in I might cancel I might cancel your conversation and send a note and say leave some room for some of the new people and Yeah, and when we have new people on Encourage them when they come through and again, that's been so gratifying. You know, I the conversations with um the conversations with gem have been very precious and And you know so many people are they're very hesitant to let Okay, shall I share this they kind of want to they kind of don't want to but then when they they share the video You all in the comment section you regulars and you know who you are you encourage them and and you and you You know Even if they're not a christian or not a christian yet or even our if they're anti-christian or struggling with it and angry at god Or something like this you encourage them this is always what i've wanted a church to be like and and we're not a church but But but some of those aspects and qualities of the christian community Is it's it's People matter to god And and if if god matters to you and people don't Then there's a problem so that's that's my heart and I want that to Be a living part of the channel. So in the next couple of days i'm gonna Just you know, i'm not going to open it up all the way and have the floods come through i'm going to open up Four or five six new slots here in august I'm gonna try and I have to and I also have to as many of you have noted I also have to find what I can bear and i've i'm i'm learning as I go here. So thanks for your patience Thanks for your restraint Twitter's a pretty good place to interact with me i'm finding because twitter is fairly Fairly short And so there's limitations to that but i i'm finding twitter to be fairly efficient as i'm trying to figure out how to deal with numbers numbers And you know, I also have to bear in mind that jesus had 12 disciples that he spent most of his time with There were actually a larger group of like 72 Which is so then you have kind of your your inner circle and then you have your congregation But then there was the crowd and jesus often would retreat to Isolated places he had to escape the crowd for for times of prayer and and and this is something I probably have to Learn to do too. So Sorry for the reruns I'm gonna open up the conversation link a little bit more. I've got one more conversation. That's sort of in the can And it's a it's a it's a sneaky good one. That's right at the end. It really gets engaging and So i'll share this week and i've got one more I've got one more Um, i've got the second part of the talk that I did in oakland at the cs lewis society I'll be sharing that this week. I hope to get one or they'll be probably definitely a rough draft for friday Coming out because i've got to preach this sunday And hopefully i'll get one or two other videos. I'm doing a lot of thinking i'm reading, you know Cs lewis's discarded image maybe bern and I should have a conversation about that He said that was his favorite cs lewis book. So We'll see what we do Again, thanks for watching. Thanks for all of you have supported financially. I don't thank you enough for that it's it's Part of the reason I don't talk about it is I don't want to forefront it and that's the same way in my church and the deacons get frustrated with me for that because I don't ask for money and I don't get people for money and i'm frankly not going to start so Yep, that's it for today. I'll post this tomorrow
