 Hi, this is Paul. We had our meetup on Tuesday night and I heard something there that I had been hearing from other people. I was talking to some friends and they were sort of complaining. They can't find any interesting podcasts or YouTube videos to listen to. Now it's just a fact that many of you who listen to my podcast, your life is arranged in such a way that YouTube and podcasts are a very big part of it. That's been true of me for a long time. I started listening to podcasts when I started listening to the twit network, Leo Laporte and tech podcasts. I listened, I was subscribed to 10 or 15 tech podcasts at one time, listening to most of them. I did that at a time in my life when things were stressful for other reasons and I wanted something that I was interested in enough to listen to but not too interested in to necessarily keep me from driving safely or falling asleep at night. And you know, over time, eventually I found Jordan Peterson and Jordan Peterson sort of brought me on to YouTube and I sort of got into the YouTube space and like many of you, when I found Jordan Peterson, he sort of grabbed my attention and I voraciously consumed not only he was in the middle of it, he was doing his biblical series at that point or I don't even remember exactly where he was in that, but doing the biblical series and then I found his other college lectures and I just devoured them and I found that to be just a heady experience. It's something like when Neo and the Matrix, they plug him in and suddenly he's in a he's in this virtual room and able to do stuff and in some ways that was sort of the rush of that for Jordan Peterson. Before that I'd used YouTube to, people would have a video linked or it wasn't done. I didn't appreciate YouTube as a social media before that, but once I got onto that then well Jordan Peterson led me to other IDW members and then I started making videos and and and here we are today. So when I heard my friends complaining that they couldn't find anything interesting to watch on YouTube and some people, well except for your stuff Paul, okay. That caught my attention and then at the meetup on Tuesday night somebody said you know everything on YouTube is boring and I thought well that's interesting. What's what's going on? Why is everything on YouTube boring? Why is there nothing to watch on TV? You know so I have Netflix and Amazon Prime and because I have AT&T, I have HBO Go and then my kids are subscribed to other networks so my Roku Box, I mean I'm the only one left in my family that still knows how to work the DirecTV and the only reason I have DirecTV is because I was going to cancel it and they called me and said well is it price? I said no not really. They said how cheap can you get us to stay? I said you're gonna have to compete with free. Well it's almost free and that way I don't lose my I don't lose my connection to another one of my guilty pleasures which is which is the Oak Island, the curse of Oak Island which it's a big tease I know but I can't get enough of it and I also binge watched Cobra Kai last weekend which was sort of interesting but sometimes my wife and I at the end of the day will sit down on the sofa and we will have sort of caught up over you know our days and then want to you know watch a little bit of TV before we head off to bed and nothing to watch and I think well look at Netflix well look at look at Amazon Prime I mean on and on and on and on and and there's never been more and now Google has a new Chromecast that is going to try to you know take from all the services even Netflix and put it into one feed based on the algorithmic ranking of watching what you're watching and enjoying and trying to you know get you to consume more content because of course that's exactly what YouTube and Apple do and well what well we're drowning in content now more than ever before why is it that we find nothing that interests us so in a sense we've sort of created this we've sort of created this hierarchy and well it's sort of like we're playing chicken with this hierarchy and they keep putting more in front of us and we put more and this surprises me I grew up in the New York metropolitan area so in terms of the United States we had one of the biggest media markets we had more this is before cable TV we had more TV channels than anyone else we had ABC NBC CBS we had Channel 5 and Channel 9 and Channel 11 and PBS on Channel 13 and well we just sit in front of TV and watched what was on and now there's nothing on TV what do you mean there's nothing on T and then you go to YouTube and I mean how many how many hours thousands of hours of content are recorded and uploaded to YouTube every minute so why is YouTube boring why is there nothing there to catch our interest why what's going on because it's not just on YouTube some of it is I'm sure but it's also in us so so what's going on with it well I'd really love to hear what you have to think and so put your comment below because I'm very interested in what your thoughts are because of what I've been doing for the last couple of days is is asking this of a lot of people not online but just just just personally what are one of the factors you know rebel wisdom and their whole space has been sense-making and I there's a lot of truth to that and part of the reason and we're seeing that especially now in the my prayer for the elections which was not answered would that whoever gets elected may it be clear and obvious to everyone so that we can at least preserve the system and it's like my prayer was not answered part of this is odd and we talked about this in the meetup because mass media is dying it's not dead yet you can still you know you can still create a huge platform or if you're on mass media that helps your platform but in the platform still have quite a bit of power but you know when I was growing up we had the three major networks and then TV can't cable TV came along and then you had the proliferation of cable news that's when of course Neil Postman was writing and now with the internet with YouTube you just have the all the micro medias you know social media is really a micro media and so the narrative is fragmented everyone yesterday posted to me Ibram Kennedy's piece on the Atlantic and you know I was reading a very interesting article about missions from from Ralph D. Winter and I was reading it I was just thinking the power of a historian to recast our past is enormously powerful because basically what we do is we you think that the past is set far from it read history the past is very much alive and we keep recasting it every day so what this means is that and this was a this was a point brought up by by Tyler at the meetup that our value hierarchies we are so bombarded with facts that and Google knew this a while ago that that's now suddenly the filter is key because there's no end of facts that we are prevented presented with and again looking at all my other videos we as limited creatures are simply unable to process the vast world of facts before us and so you need a sorting mechanism and so really what's at play this is where I get into God being both agentic and arenic what's at play is that the these platforms are now have now become sorting mechanisms and that's enormously powerful because it's one thing to present two views and then try to influence someone between them it's a whole nother thing to blot out all the other views and present one idea and you sort of leave your your little sense makers helpless before you because what are you supposed to know so so now to the degree that we are bombarded with facts our value hierarchies our value assumptions these these in a sense internalized platforms within us are the ones that then select so which is the case with with Joe Biden versus Donald Trump now after election day and and do we look at this one video that shows you know polling irregularities and and ballots stuffed into the garbage or we do look at another news source that says we called every state and then at some point the states will certify and and and and and and and so it's it's sort of the epigenetics of epistemology well what do I mean by that well to the degree that I understand what epigenetics are that they sort of turn on and turn off the genetic code there and and and only some things actually get expressed and so in some ways that the the genetic code is the hardware and the epigenetics are sort of the software and they're turning things on and off and that's what's happening we're simply bombarded by all this information from our screens and we have to filter it and so it's our it's in a sense our value hierarchies are internalized platforms already that dispose us to see two worlds and that's where you get Scott Adams two screens and and so that's that play and then of course well would what do you wonder well how have these value hierarchies been been created well they've been created because they've they've they've grown and grown and grown and grown and every now and then we get a flipped and so there's a red pill or a blue pill or a bread pill or on and on and on when in a sense the the platform flips but the platform is never fully flipped because we have memories and there and we have institutions and we have families and we have relationships and so back when there was really in a sense when there was a broad consensus and all of the meaning was made for you and you sort of programmed the herd as it were well now there's all these tiny little smaller herds and now they're sort of competing with one another and well what does that mean with respect to there's nothing to watch well there's the mapped in the unmapped territory in us and so well you've probably been consuming and consuming and consuming all of the channels that you consume until the point that well you're done watching Jordan Peterson videos because he never says anything new anymore and the fact that he hasn't said anything really for nine months means there's nothing new and so you sort of have the end of the Truman show where ever what's how's it gonna end what's Truman gonna do and again the my favorite scene is with those two security guards and and then Truman walks off and Christoph in the sky says end transmission and everybody at home first looks at it and then they grab the remote and they say what's next well our map territory we've been you know ingesting YouTube after YouTube after YouTube of people who are all high on our salience hierarchies and our tribal relationships and all our platform selves and so you know how many more outrage videos can I watch from the Weinsteins about the woke I'm okay yeah yep yep yep I you hit that outrage button plenty and it's kind of like well the buttons getting tired of button of being pushed and so you don't have to convince me that there's a problem with with wokeness I'm convinced I don't need to see any more videos on it and and so then you just watch the food fight and it's like okay I've watched the food fight there we are and and so this this collective cognition which of course John another fancy verve Hakey term I feel bad I keep stealing John verve Hakey's language but he's been so helpful with is giving up the language so you know this collective cognition that we're doing it's just getting increasingly tribal I think there's also right now a huge exhaustion of caring part of the reason Donald Trump was successful is that you know part of his skill was to dominate the news and what what you know what you know shouldn't have surprised me but this this of course if we have a news media whose dynamic is fundamentally commercial you want to lead with whatever people will be fixated upon and and Donald Trump has managed for the last six years to to really dominate and hold the attention of the nation and with him being president you had to cover him but he can be exhausting and now we have a pandemic and and and and I think there's just an exhaustion of caring and you know we've got political anxiety okay well depending on who you want to win or didn't want to win you know we're nervous about political you know and and social social instability well some people want instability and that makes us even more anxious because I think a lot of people who say they want instability yeah I'm you know bring a certain degree of instability in your life and we'll see how much you you know you want the status quo back again so we've got political anxiety we've got COVID anxiety we've got financial anxiety because of all this we've got social rest anxiety we've got familial cohesion anxiety people of course fighting within their families about these political things you know even even if the mantra is small government the degree to which politics is just eclipsing everything else in our life is actually the antithesis of the whole idea behind small government politics should be some fairly nerdy thing that is little ways far off from everybody else's life so that your agency in your life can be maximalized that's the idea behind small government but you know what if what if small government is so noisy it eclipses any other conversation in your world and starts disrupting your church patterns your family patterns your relational patterns your work patterns now suddenly when you go to a restaurant you know do you care what party the restauranteer voted for do you care you know who the other people on your street voted for are you gonna start taking names of who aligned with the other political party even if you're a small government activist to the degree to which politics is infusing and colonizing all of the ideas of our life that's not small government freedom should be freedom from politics freedom from thinking about the president freedom from the cares of these institutions and so it's just exhaustion of caring and and then the political discourse goes well you know and and on the woke side you know if you're not anti-racist you're racist and well what does it mean to be anti-racist well and and that gets tyrannical quickly you've got to keep acknowledging your privilege and you have to do this 24-7 and again as a someone who grew up in a conservative Calvinist tradition this all looks very familiar because I've seen this on the religious front so it's just an exhaustion of caring and and at some time at some point people just collapse in the chair and say oh spare me from it and that on top of all the normal life anxiety of of paying bills and and managing your household and getting enough to eat and worrying about your insurance and the car won't start and then you know relationships with the neighbors or the spouse or the kids or the parents on and on and and all of this with a daily onslaught of moral political demands that's one of the real calamities that we've seen is is is the political is the moral and it just keeps ratcheting up and at some point it just hits a circuit breaker and doesn't mean you don't have political ideas it just I don't want them running my life and so then I asked people what well what are you watching or what and and they tell me things which are really interesting one person in the meetup said you know I'm watching engine rebuilding videos and I already know how to rebuild engines and in fact when he drove here he drove a car that I hadn't recognized and he like me has kids and so he has a number of cars and I didn't recognize that car and it's a cool car so I asked him about it he says yeah it's a good car but you know it's a it's a it's a reliable car and at this point in my life I've rebuilt engines before and I don't want to rebuild them anymore I just want the car to run and another member of the meetup talked about he was basically watching you know basically life advice shows you know sort of life like advice columns and people come in with their problems and and they they say their problem on the air and then the advice columnist gives them the answer to their problem and zip zip zip zip zip problem solved in 10 minutes 15 minutes 20 minutes 30 minutes why do we like these very reliable videos right now well they're sort of like little morality plays and so we have these these huge we have these huge problems in our lives that we can't resolve and so we just want to see something resolved we want to see the drain cleared we want to see the wiring fixed we want to see the the cars engine turn over we want to get the sense that we can address something in our life fix it resolve it move on and well the whole lot of things in your life you can't move on and so when these things are pointed at you day in and day out you just get exhausted and and so we have all these little morality plays and you know you're not left either with an endless battle nor anxiety too close to home but good guys and bad guys clean narratives and that tends to be what we retreat into and you know one of the things that I've noticed on on Netflix and on Amazon is that well TV you know they're always TV networks are always fighting the last war trying to anticipate the next war trying to figure out what's going to be the next hot thing of course but they're doing that by almost always repeating what was hot last time in the cycle before the cycle before and and a lot of these shows are these these ongoing you know you think about Breaking Bad five seasons of watching someone come apart and right now with the anxiety that everyone's feelings well some people are gonna watch that because they can forget their own anxieties by watching somebody else's anxieties but for a lot of people it's just too close to home so they they they want they don't want the chattering voice who agrees with them and tells them what to think and they don't want the ongoing drama of Tony Soprano trying to you know figure out how to deal with all of his problems his problems at home his problems with the mob is you know all of those problems they want something that's boom boom boom done and actually if you think I'm just thinking about it now a lot of the sitcoms that you saw in the 70s you know problems wrapped up in a nice tidy bow in 18 minutes and we see that I think at some deep level we're comforted by that we're reassured by that now part of what I think we're seeing and part of the reason I think YouTube is boring is YouTube has been editing and you know Stefan Molyneux is gone there's your little advice columnist with your sort of your clean rather authoritarian direct lines to you know you know why are you mystified that you know your sister being your girlfriend is a bad idea come on and then you get a stern moral talking to and you know I'm always amazed at these kinds of shows because if you watch the show you recognize that yeah if you're you know a hundred thousand dollars in debt and 400 pounds overweight and if you call up Stefan Molyneux or someone like him they're gonna chew you out so why do you call to be chewed out well it's not unlike going to the kind of church that beats you up and you think well why is it that it's all the people who expect to get beat up in church go to church to get beat up by the pastor by him yelling at them and moralizing over them well because in a sense if they can't actually pull off the morality themselves they get a little hit of self-righteousness at least vicariously participating in the little morality play I mean we're complex like that and and so part of what's been happening as the as the as these micro medias as these platforms get more and more important and grow larger and larger well now suddenly the the larger moral nannies in the culture look and say well you've you've really got to get rid of those bad actors and so you know you cut off Alex Jones and you cut off Stefan Molyneux and well why and they think well this is the right way to go now again if you go back to my last video part of what's deep in Protestantism and deep in in in atheism and very deep actually into the wokeness is very this this imagination of directness that well if if more and more of our youth aren't sort of following the the the arc of history as we imagine it's supposed to go YouTube must be to blame or Twitter must be to blame and so let's let's get these people off the platforms and but what they don't realize is that sometimes you want to keep the clowns around why because they're clowns you want to keep the clowns around because for a while you you kind of get on the clown train and you ride the clown train and you go and you go and you go but after you've been on it for a while you realize I can't ride this train anymore and then you kind of step off it's sort of like rumspring of the mind you know that's this you know that so the Amish have this very strict controlled way of life but then when you come become a young adult they say get out of the community and go out into the world and decide if you want to be an Amish person or not because once you come back and commit we need to know that you're down and you're gonna conform and you're going to sign up for our little tyranny because we don't want you you know wobbly once you sign up so go out and try it and and and so the clowns are sort of like that you know I we had a little watch party and the discord server with with the Alex Jones Joe Rogan video and you want these guys around because well we've got these we've got these outliers and this is where again Peugeot's stuff is so important because you've got the center and you've got the fringe you need to keep the fringe around if you keep cutting off the fringe the fringe is gonna manifest itself just like you're gonna need to sleep and so if you keep cutting off the fringe new fringe will emerge make your peace with the fringe and you know it's gonna manifest itself and some people are gonna go out there and some you're gonna lose some people to the fringe but you're gonna lose a little bit of people to the fringe if you at least have your entire ecosystem in some kind of balance in order to the degree that you try to keep cutting off the fringe well then you keep basically making your whole system unstable so so we go to the fringe once again in many ways to recalibrate the center you sort of know what a politician should look like when you watch Alex Jones because you might think well I like watching Alex Jones but well you know when you put Alex Jones in charge what do you get you know what you're gonna get so let Alex Jones be Alex Jones let Kanye be Kanye let Donald Trump be Donald Trump they are what they are now use your agency to decide do you want him to be president or you do not want him to be president why or why not how does that system go this is the whole idea and the more the the algorithms start trying to morally nanny things well that's sort of the end of the death of YouTube and then other you know suddenly you've given you know it's like the old story when the you know the son or the daughter brings a boyfriend or a girlfriend home and you look at him you think this is this is not gonna end well yeah you try the direct approach and see how that goes you might try the patient approach and you know if you've raised this child this child's probably gonna figure some things out you always lose some to the fringe but for the most part fringes are fringes because they're fringes that's just the way it is so if the mainstream micro platforms deep platform the hungry or the fringy to further out well suddenly folks are watching bit shoot and they're switching parlor for Twitter and on and on and on and on this is what they're going to do and you know doesn't seem that the now we used to have the mainstream media now we have the dominant platforms doesn't seem like the dominant platforms have really figured this out yet why because well what are their algorithms shooting for it's it's interesting that these platforms just like almost every other even quasi living thing we produce the living thing we produces what does it try to do it tries to maintain its own survival that's what happens when you develop a corporation that's what happens when you develop any kinds of institution they try to guarantee their own survival and almost always their efforts to guarantee their own survival undermine their future and this is sort of what's happening with these these mainstream platforms and so we sort of wind up with one of my favorite lines out of a movie is from the movie the sunshine state then it used to be on YouTube but of course it probably violated copyright so it's no longer available on YouTube is when they're getting out on a golf course nature on a leash in the beginning there was nothing out of this muck and the mangroves we created this nature on a leash it was a golf course well you can have the golf course but the weeds keep growing and the alligators keep stumbling on and at some point nature will reassert itself as human culture eclipses and colonizes the natural world why do we hunger and preserve it and of course this was happening you know quite a bit in the 19th century the development of the national parks John Muir Teddy Roosevelt what's with this you know America on one hand felt the need to you know civilize and colonize the Native Americans and the indigenous people and at the same time they were glorifying them and sort of this weird way and you see the same things happening right now with racial struggles on one on one hand you're sort of fetishizing the poor and fetishizing the outcast and in that way sort of placing them in the middle but what you're really doing is sort of colonizing them and telling them they can't be them and I see this all the time with the homeless the homeless act a certain way and well you can make them not homeless anymore and then guess what they won't be homeless and they won't act that way again so this is what we've been doing on a massive scale with respect to you know just devouring putting you know turning first turning fields into farms and then farms and to suburbs and then suburbs and to city and this is what we've been doing and then well why why do we hunger for the natural rhythms of the world well these rhythms recalibrate us and that their patterns larger than our own and they're longer than our own and and you know we resist and they resist our own meddling they keep coming back you can think of the themes of Jurassic Park and this just shows that we need to get beyond ourselves to find an equilibrium again we want a system that is that is beyond us we want a system we can't colonize and this gets into the specific what what CS Lewis calls the specific pleasure of the inferior it's it's the dog before his master it's it's our desire to be to be loved and possessed and devoured by one stronger and greater more beautiful and and better than ourselves and that's part of the reason we have this enduring love for nature but suddenly we realize but then we're out of control you know that's a that's a big part of I think what went on with with the Jordan Peterson wave and one of the first things I thought of when I heard this meetup group now we've been meeting together we started in January 2018 and this coming January will be January will be our three-year anniversary and you know we've noticed and we talked about this at our last meeting you know our our conversations getting scale stale now our media meetups have been smaller because we've just sort of you know a lot of people it's just like church really in some ways only certain temperaments of our meetups will show and we're not publicizing it so we're not opening the doors and we try to meet outside yada yada yada but you know so I listened to all these people that were just captivated by Jordan Peterson but then and we were talking about the book tour and then we all pretty much agreed once and some of us heard three or four of those book tour talks live and pretty much once you went to one you had seen the show that was it was map territory it had gotten decadent and I talked about the fact that part of the reason long-term churches have focused on keep coming back to the Bible because the Bible in that sense because in a sense you make you put the Bible on the top of your hierarchy that's sort of a way of making it both sovereign and wild and and so then when you preach you keep going back to the Bible as your sovereign and as something that's wild and that then you know sort of in a shamanic way rejiggers you and keeps what you're doing fresh which is why I think frankly the only way Jordan Peterson has a hope of staying fresh and having in other ways it wave is if he actually uses the Bible we'll see you know we'll see was it what he's able to pull off and we'll see what comes because as every preacher I know and every church planter I know you go out and you give it your best shot and you see what happens you're not in control of what happens the world is big and you are small and and so you know it was so interesting that a group that two three years ago where it was having this revelatory experience on YouTube now just heard that done this heard that this is boring what about that this no longer keeps my interest now on one hand that no longer keeping your interest can be a sign of you that in some ways boring people get bored in other ways it's also a sign of something else in almost everything in life is yeah the first draft is true but there are more drafts that are there and and so and I still find you know video comments on Jordan Peterson's video I you know I'm deeply thankful to the man for saving me and of course it was comments like that that drew my attention early on and the tide is still moving again now Jonathan Peugeot's conversation with Carl Benjamin is on Jonathan's channel and I listened to that conversation and I thought yeah and you know John Verveke and the meaning crisis I mean the the tide the surge beneath the Jordan Peterson wave was very real and that surge is still coming up and I think in fact that is tied to this this boredom with with YouTube and with Netflix and with the platforms and with the algorithms and and the hunger for the wild now that that hunger for the wild perhaps in some communities means they want anarchy because they want to get out of the patterns they want to tear down the patterns and well the difficulty is that anarchy is its own pattern and it's pretty well established what happens when you tear down the structures you just get something more natural more bestial the strong take the weak and again I've recommended before reading Timothy Snyder's Black Earth because he he makes the assertion that and the whole wave between Nazis versus communists communists imagine we need to establish a we need to establish a divine state and then that divinity will somehow pass away the Nazis are much more shorter term well we'll use the state to to sort of attack state ism itself and to reduce us all to our our natural ways so that well then the strong will take the week and it's a highly green highly naturalistic vision of the good that the Nazis had and it was also extremely tyrannical and you know most of us as Tom Holland says well we don't need the devil anymore we have the Nazis so tight still moving in and and we wait for the wild to break in but it's a certain kind of wild we want we want it wild but we want it wild good not wild evil and and we want a degree of chaos but but but we want the chaos to somehow be within a range that says this chaos because chaos is always fear of loss but potential for growth and so we want the chaos to be tinged with hope and and knowing there's something out there beyond the pale that can bring hope refresh new life but but still and so when I listen to Carl Benjamin talk about church well on one hand he doesn't see any potential in church it's not wild enough which is why he won't go and I think this is part of the reason Kanye Sunday Kanye Sunday services rather than these Sunday assemblies done by atheists okay we're gonna sing the Beatles okay we're gonna sing Journey okay you're gonna trot out some artwork from the Renaissance or or some idea and we won't say the word God and that will somehow there's a reason that doesn't work it's not wild enough so when Kanye who is you know in an in Peugeot in terms of clown starts a Sunday service then suddenly all the Hollywood stars want to be there well why well because it's it's going to be wild and this is you know this is actually part of the fetus fetus fetish size that dish I can't say the word fetish ization of African-Americans in our culture because we do fetish eyes them and and notice how with with Bruce Almighty God is black and and look at the shack you know Oprah is God well why because we fetish eyes the different we fetish eyes the strange we fetish eyes the fringe because we're aware that the potentiality and the promises beyond our grasp and so well Carl Benjamin's right there at the point well I don't see any potential especially in the churches that I've known but something in my imagination says I should go out there and find something church-like but but I want I'm anxious about it I don't want it to be too out of control but it needs to be out of control and and and again read CS Lewis's chapter on pantheism because nature needs to be alive but nature is red in tooth and claw I need to I need to know that there's hope and promise in that chaotic potentiality and that sort of brings me to CS Lewis's imagery of Aslan and here at the end of I think this was the line the witch in the wardrobe the movie version you know that a little girl that played Lucy was so cute and and tumnus the fawn you know Lewis starts this he had this this vision about a fawn and a lamp post a fawn with an umbrella that was Lewis's vision and and he started writing a children's book started with the fawn and the children and Lewis said basically once once Aslan once Aslan you know gambled into the story the whole story started to write itself well why is Aslan not a tame lion why doesn't Aslan stay for the stay for the the coronation party of the four chairs and care parallel why doesn't Aslan stay why does Aslan slowly walk off into the sunset and Lucy's like well why isn't Aslan staying because Aslan's not a tame lion he's a good lion not a tame lion and if you read the horse and his boy the lion will take a chunk out of you now and then it is not the case that those teeth and that claws aren't worth anything they're for something and there's a reason that when he roars you you run away and hide and and and you pray to the thing that mate that might just kill you that's the religion we want that's the religion we need and the reason that there's nothing good to watch on on YouTube falls into this matrix so that's why YouTube is boring because you know it's increasingly not wild and we need we long for the wild it has to be beyond the pale but yeah it will be dangerous yeah you don't know what will happen when you get there yeah it'll be a mess and there'll be moments of despair but you know to invoke Tolkien you know Bilbo first finds the the dwarves at his door and the hobbit a royal nuisance and they all eat there and you know mess up his house and do all of that and then they go off and the old took inside of him stirs and he goes off on this adventure which is a very non-hobbit thing to do well some of these atheist hobbits are getting a taste of what they think and what they need and well they thought that this world of reason would be enough and you know they watch Star Trek and well this is what will happen and well Dostoevsky and and life from the underground Dostoevsky was right we want the wild we need the wild and and in some ways I think part of the reason for the Jordan Peterson wave was he was outside the script he was wild and something drew us and so the lamb is the lion and the lion is the lamb you hear the lion and you see the lamb and so he's not a tame lion but I think that's what our heart is longing for even in the midst of these anxieties and cares so I think yeah that's why YouTube's boring
