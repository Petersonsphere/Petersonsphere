 Hi, my name is Paul. I'm the pastor of Looting Stones Christian Reformed Church in Sacramento, California, and I'm doing a commentary series on Jordan Peterson's biblical biblical his biblical series the psychological significance of the Bible and By series number one the introduction to the idea of God is really prolegomena He's really setting the groundwork for it Now I've been Part of the part of what I've been I'm doing this I'm doing this commentary basically along similar lines to Peterson in terms of trying to figure this out and I'm using YouTube and trying to see if this is a fruitful platform for me to do some thinking out loud to articulate some things and I've really appreciated the comments that I've gotten so far on the past videos that I've done so if you again if you if you enjoy these These rather rambling Working things out in my head as I go just let me know I'll keep doing them so far I've I think I've grown a lot in terms of figuring out What this platform is how this works and maybe I'll do some more reflecting on that as we go forward but one of the things that I've been I've been thinking about is is how Jordan Peterson is upsetting the The battle lines that are that are entrenched I I almost think about World War one in terms of the American Christian scene there's there's basically two sides. There's the main line and the fundamentalist now I'm not including the Orthodox the Roman Catholics and Evangelicals are sometimes fundamentalists and sometimes they're more moderate the Christian forum church that I that I serve is is kind of in the middle It's a historic it's a historic immigrant Denomination that came over from the Netherlands. It's its first splits came in the Netherlands over over Over modernity some of the the initial splits of the denomination the in Dutch the offskiding and the doli where the where local church leaders were troubled by Liberalism in the Netherlands in the 19th century and they split off and so these these battle lines have been going not only in North America but in Europe and and right now it kind of sets where Where you've got the main line versus the fundamentalist those are kind of the two poles and of course It's it's way more complex than that but just for the sake of for the sake of discussion will look at those two poles and one of the things that I reflect on is that I would imagine that a Lot of people assume when I first tell them about Jordan Peterson that he would feel at home with the main line because main line Interpretation recently tends to resist literalism and brace Symbolic interpretations they they don't have any problem with Darwin or science But but increasingly for the main line their their faith expression is Is very Activistic politically and very much aligns with what I call progressive liberationism And and so if you if you go to a main line church you will It depends the main line is huge but shrinking fast if you go to a main line church, you'll you'll probably See people who basically say well the you know We traditionally are Christians and we might still do something with the liturgy But but how we practice the gospel how we practice our love for Jesus in the world Will be along the same lines as and then you can go down the list They might you know sanctuary movements LGBT a number of the lines that that that basically align say in the United States with the Democratic Party now Now initially a lot of people that I listen to or who have either drifted to the main line or in the main line Say this this our particular Context should be perfect for us because we align so much with what seems to be the ascendant morality of progressive Liberationism in in the United States today the difficulty that they face is that for many people? Within the secular frame, why would you need the church when you have let's say the Democratic Party? I mean if the You know if if we might say that on the Republican side You know the fundamentalist churches are the Republicans at prayer Well, the the mainline churches are the Democrats at prayer And so one of the things that we've we've been seeing is this this division in the church that has that has followed the political division and I find that I Actually, I find that reprehensible in in my own congregation There are some very conservative Republicans and there are some there are some Very liberal Democrats and and we all maintain It's a small congregation, but we all maintain ourselves Here in the body of Christ and some who are Democrats that say the church has to follow these certain issues and get Activistic about it they'll come here and they'll not find a place here because that's not what we do And then I've had others leave who say pastor what you really need to do is is call out people on these Republican issues and I'll tell them that's not what we're going to do when we're worshipping God on Sunday And if you look at my sermons, you'll notice that I often use a lot of political references I don't shy away from engaging in what's happening in our contemporary in our contemporary space. How can we not? But I am NOT going to carry water for either the Democrats or the Republicans I of course have my own political views and right now increasingly I find I feel myself I don't have a party I can really align or identify with wholeheartedly But but I think that's always been the case But but Peterson comes around and in many ways a lot of people initially think well well, he should pretty much align up with the with the mainline churches because He you know, he's he he embraces science he embraces symbolic reading of the Bible I know a lot of my conservative friends when they listen to some of the things he says as well I I can't go on with this guy because he's not really down with me in terms of the Bible But but I also listen to listen to others So the more fundamentalist camp likes literalistic interpretation hates Darwin since the 80s have gotten involved in politics But value spiritual activities like prayer evangelism going to church giving money to causes helping the poor Fundamentalists and and religious conservatives are very much nested within their frame their conception and and as hopefully I continue to work through Peterson, I I'm going to to to really try to dig into this question of representation and then practice in terms of What does it mean to be a Christian in our contemporary? Context and I I don't believe it means to be the Democratic Party at prayer And I don't think it means to be the Republican Party at prayer and I don't think we can simply shelve 2,000 years of practice it makes a lot of sense that you know, you could see Jordan Peterson's Relationship with John Peugeot I think I'm getting his last name right and and it makes sense because in many ways the Orthodox Church which is Which is in many ways the oldest tradition the the Western Latin Church split off from the Eastern Church the Eastern Church has had their own travails and their own path through Through Greece and through Russia and through that whole side. It makes a lot of sense that Peterson You know the video I'll show later in this program Peterson finds himself in the pulpit with with Orthodox Christians and and there's been some interesting things some some The United States as it has for the Jews as it has for many religious groups has been a fertile place for the Orthodox to kind of live past some of the stuff that they had to deal with in in Greece and In the Middle East in Russia in in the East and so it's gonna be very interesting to see what happens To the Orthodox Church, but but this is why Peterson tends to cut across these views so so mainliners listen to Peterson and they complain because he's not lining up with progressive liberationism and and he's not lining up with With them in other ways and in fact, he's a critic of this Marxism that I think many of them mainline kind of default into Because they act like human beings and we're all naturally tribal and when we see people that we Respect and are making the right noises We tend to kind of follow along and obviously if you listen to Peterson He's he's not lining up with that group yet yet fundamentalists listen to him and they say, you know The way he talks about the Bible. I don't expect to hear someone use Darwinistic evolution to to justify a Really? literal that's not literalistic, but it's justify a serious reading of of of Genesis 2 & 3 and and so I think this is this is what's causing for This is in this way Peterson is crossing this this battlefield that that it's all Entrenched and there's a no man's land and that's why in sometimes in some ways Peterson's gonna get shot out from both sides because he is in no man's land and the same comes with the with the atheists and the Christians a commenter posted a link to a Jonathan Haight video from 2013 Rehashing some of his some of the stuff from the book that he published then which was an excellent book I read it and and very much enjoyed it But but you know, this is why you know atheists are saying I want to look at Christians and Christians who are you know? A little antagonistic and afraid of Darwin are listening to Jordan Peterson and saying, you know He makes a lot of sense and and Christians like me who have never really found a home in either pole listen to this and say We should listen to this is there is there a way forward? Is there is there something helpful that that's coming down the road through this now? Now one of the things I listen for when I listen for Peterson are are what I call gospel articulations now You can one of the interesting things that you read about the Bible when you read through the Bible is Is there's this thing called the gospel which Christians talk about and it's and it's good news now I I almost can't say those words in our contemporary frame especially if you've got a lot of evangelicals around you or even Jehovah's Witnesses or or latter or Mormons if you say gospel people people frame that in a certain frame of reference, but but in the first century That that was a very interesting term to use because it was you know in the words of of some of my Reformed brother and the gospel is good news not good advice. So if you listen to Tim Keller You'll you'll hear that you'll hear that phrase a lot and and if you look at say pastors in the PCA the Presbyterian Church of America, which is the which is the conservative split off one of the conservative split offs of the The PC USA or the Presbyterian Church of the United States of America, which is the mainline group You know the gospel is good news not good advice but but the gospel is also something that we and I think about Peterson and Jung here where there's this there's this dream state and Where we know more than we can articulate and where we are We see this thing and we're starting we're trying to figure out and we're trying to figure out How this works for us and then we put words on it and in fact you find that process in the Bible too one of the one of the most Gospel II books in the Old Testament is the is the Prophet Jonah and the The theme the theme sentence of the of the book of Jonah in the old is I think the theme sentence of the Old Testament And could in fact be a great thematic sentence of the Bible, which is salvation is of the Lord Now you get into the synoptics and Jesus walks around announcing remember not advising announcing the kingdom of heaven and and in Matthew or the kingdom of heaven in Matthew the kingdom of God in Mark and Luke and And there are reasons for that and and then in John you get into eternal life and John keeps talking about eternal life and And as we get into you know light and life and all of the different ways that the gospel of John rather uniquely Frames this thing called the gospel and and Pete and Paul uses a variety of statements one of the most innovative and important one that Paul uses is is being in Christ and and so the the the gospel this gospel goes out and every age has to try to Articulate this and embody this and and and practice it yet yet And I think the Orthodox does this well the Orthodox Church does this well and their preservation of practice that And again, this is what what helps me with Peterson that this this gospel doesn't just inhabit our brains through Articulated speech it's something that we know and can't put it into words And it's something that we do with our body and it's something that if you've been formed by it now if you're reading James K Smith who is a who is a popular author Philosophy professor at Calvin College. He's been he's been working this neo-Augustinian ancient modern revival of talking about practice and how we you know Christian formation and practice and this gets into You know There's a whole bunch of here's the thing about a pastor that the Christian conversation is large and huge and ongoing so What in many ways the church has been doing since 1500 is where you know Charles Taylor talks about you know that kind of the the the March of of secularism moving on in many ways though that the Christian Church in the West through fundamentalism and evangelicalism has has assumed Kind of the the medieval Christendom death anxiety One of the things that if you read a biography of Martin Luther you see very clearly that Martin Luther is is right at the end of medieval Christendom and he his his faith journey He goes from being someone who was going to be a lawyer to someone who decides to be a monk because of a thunderstorm and he cries out to st. Anne and you know the It's not it's not the the millennialism the the Apocalyptic anxiety of the Middle Ages was just as palpable then as it was in the 19th century or even in the 20th century when when Prognosticators come forward and predict the end of the end of the days and and so this this anxiety about death has been Within our culture and so in the middle to part of the 20th century Evangelism explosion came out with their and this is so Quintessentially American came out with their surefire way of making Christians where you knock on the door and and you say if you were to die Tonight, do you know where you'd go now now living in Blue State, California? Many people if you say if you were to die tonight, do you know where you'll go? People are either over here and say well, I'll be gone because I'll just be dead So I've got nothing to fear and I won't hurt and this is I think part of the reason why suicide continues to creep up Or others will simply have a moralistic therapeutic Framework where they'll say I've been a good person. I'll go to a better place I don't know what that is or they'll just grab things from Hollywood heaven can wait or the good place or or it's a wonderful Life or anything off the shelf but and this this practice that that very much depended on medieval Catholicism Where where there's this anxiety about death that was very much in the culture very much in many ways Because life was short and people died often even when I was a missionary in the Dominican Republic almost any family I would know would have lost a child before the age of five death was common and so people were obviously very anxious about death Here in insecure affluent North America people aren't worried about death And so this idea of I'm going to church to get saved which is implicitly connected with I go to heaven when I die and not hell Well this this doesn't grab people anymore and and churches have been noticing this so So what happens as the culture change changes Christians? Well Christians, it's not just the matter of Christians taking a step back and say oh we have to figure out how to do this different Christians do do that, but but what happens more is that the cultural changes? They influence us and we reframe the gospel different and and we come up with new things And and so you find various motivations from from different cultural settings now There's been updating in terms of missionary methods in the 80s and 90s in the in the Protestant Church We have the seeker movement go through which which very much demolit Demathologized the setting you took down all the crosses from church you met in something if you visit say Willow Creek you met at something that looked something like a you know a Community college and and Bill Hybels would say we're going to create a safe space which I listen to now 30 years later We're going to create a safe space for people to encounter a dangerous message And he wanted and Bill Hybels wanted to create fully formed disciples of Jesus Christ And but but in many ways the the basic framework from medieval Christianity Updated into American evangelicalism was was basically the same so you'd you'd have You'd have contemporary music you had a lot of wisdom preaching to try and give the Bible credibility But then when you'd sit down with someone you'd lead them through the Roman Road or the four spiritual laws Which tended to be I think late stage The late stage modernist conception which was an adaptation of medieval medieval Christianity so At least early Protestant Christianity or Protestant Christianity and then after that we've had the movement The the emergent movement which really split into two there's kind of the conservative liturgical ancient modern and then the the more liberal wing that that is that has fully braced progressive liberation ism if if only a little bit behind them, so you know and When I talk to people in the Midwest and they think of a church plant or a new church they think about say a suburban non a suburban evangelical non-denominational Big box church which will tend to be just kind of an incremental updating of the seeker movement Now many of the new churches that are getting a lot of traction with younger people now. You've got liturgy You've got communion every Sunday. You're talking about practice You're putting you're putting ashes on for for Holy Week And this is part of the reason that again, and we've seen this all along You know you see it you see it an increasing interest in the Roman Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church But but many Americans, you know, they're Many Americans are not down for the kind of rigors that these older traditions and denominations And denominations demand of people if you're if you're really going to be a Roman Catholic It's a pretty big demanding package if you're really gonna be you know, go into the Orthodox Church It's a pretty big demanding package and many Americans want a religion where they can slide it on Sunday Listen to a little message, you know Feel a little different and then you know go somewhere with it But in all fairness the fundamentalist or the evangelical program is also a pretty significant demanding package And as I think Christendom continues to fade and levels of chaos increasingly rise in people's lives I think a lot of the people I just found the an interesting youtuber who's who's Documenting on YouTube. I'm sorry. I can't remember his name Documenting on YouTube exactly what he's doing as he's as he's sorting himself out and keeping his room clean And hopefully he's going to get a job and move out of his parents house and and and and get a girlfriend and then get a wife And then have a kid and and go on and and do something which 50 years ago Nobody had to even think about because we had a culture that they could simply ride on and do it so so we've seen this this migration of of Christianity and and part of what I wonder is whether or not Peterson is going to be part of a new synthesis Because he's on one hand. He's an he's got his unapologetic embrace of contemporary science He is a scientist and he he he follows Darwin and he embraces Nietzsche And so on one hand he's got that yet yet Which again you would think he would drift over towards the main line, but he's resisting implicit. He's not only resisting it He's calling it out. He's railing against it. He's I mean if you want to get him excited poke him here and off he goes Because he you know, he's a he's a child like me. He's a child of the 80s. He remembers the he remembers the The Cold War. I don't know if I was I don't know if I was as traumatized by him by the culture by the Cold War Maybe he was more traumatized by it I don't know but but you know, or it's just his personality off he goes That's that's you know that in a sense That's part of why it's so fun to watch him to listen to his rants and listen to him rail So so he's not going to align with the main line and and there's an ancient modern Synthesis in terms of his in symbolism and mythology and again I see some of this in CS Lewis and and Lewis was you know Lewis I think in many ways Was the one of the most powerful Christian apologists in the 20th century and it was amazing watching for example evangelicals and even Fundamentalists fundamentalists got a leery and evangelicals are often kind of watered-down fundamentalists. They don't fit in the main line They don't really they're not really hardcore They're they're trying to work the synthesis and and it was amazing in the 20th century How many evangelicals embraced CS Lewis and and here's a guy if you looked at CS Lewis's actual beliefs Well, he was an Anglican. He's a little Roman anti-roman Catholic in some ways But but clearly believed in evolution had some interesting ideas about the second coming and and some people think you know snuck in some Universalistic stuff from from George McDonald who was one of CS Lewis's heroes and and so in many ways CS Lewis is a strange Mascot and hero for evangelicals, but he became one and in some ways I see Jordan Peterson in that same way because he is as CS Lewis did he is working this this other angle and and basically Connecting the church to far older broader Conversations and I think I think Peterson is right and that there's something there, you know in terms of what Jung found that There's a there's a firmware level to us, you know, and and some of it maybe got down into our hardware There's a there's a firmware level to us in in which all of this stuff in the Bible Connects with us in a deep way in these in these selves behind us that that Jung talks about and and we don't have it I've got a mosquito in here and I've got to talk about malaria on Sunday, but we that we don't really have figured out and so I Think you know, I I do wonder and I know some of my friends think I'm nuts for this but but I do wonder if Peterson is on to something and if if like Lewis now Peterson is Flowering now in the 21st century if he's if he's doing something that is important and doing something that's going to be valuable not only in terms of Not only in terms of the conversation of the intellectual conversational life of the church But but the question will be whether any of these thoughts will actually get into practice within the churches, so Yeah question of practice now now I know you know reading comments and listening to friends A lot of conservative Christians have have heresy anxiety about Jordan Peterson and I can understand that Jordan Peterson is Jordan Peterson is being very authentic about what he believes and very honest and again if you listen to him You know why he's being honest and I I frankly respect that kind of honesty and and The kind of duplicity and and disingenuous practice Here's a here's a here's a difficult thing about being a human being in order for a religious tradition to really grip you It's it's got to be demanding There's a guy. I can't remember his name right now He's doing a little thing called the masculinist and and he had a he had an interesting. He had an interesting one on You know basically religions and part of the problem with a lot of Protestant religions, especially the mainline some evangelicals Not as much the fundamentalist is that that these religions aren't taken seriously enough to really grip you And and so part of that package is you formed by the subculture and and you develop Pretty you develop pretty sharp antibodies within you about Practice and about dogma and and this is part of what gives your religion strength But but it's also this this gets into the boundary stuff and the border stuff that Peterson talks about it also makes you reactive And so if you're Temperamentally like me kind of high in openness that makes being a member of a conservative religious tradition Both and both an asset in terms of this society Because on one hand I've got some stuff to work through and and so, you know, will will Jordan Peterson pronounce heresy? I think Absolutely. I think we all do and and one of the fun things is that I if you know enough theology and you know enough church history You can often spout you can find it. You can find the most ardent fundamentalists and and and art And I think that's the fun thing about it. I think that's the fun thing about it. I think that's the fun thing about it Well, you can find it you can find the most ardent fundamentalists and and and ardent, you know people who are down for their tradition Most determined within their tradition spouting heresy without them knowing it. I see it all the time in the church But what is heresy? This is from alistair mcgrath's terrific book on heresy So what is heresy heresy is best seen as a form of christian belief that more by accident than divine design Ultimately ends up subverting to stabilizing or even destroying the core of the christian faith both this process of Destabilization and and the identification of its threat may be spread out over an extended period of time which which means that There's a lot of trial and error in theology and there's a lot of trial and error in In the christian church and if you if you read the new testament closely You can get a sense of that you you get the sense that the new testament was a wild place and paul comes into a synagogue and and kind of Starts preaching about the resurrection of jesus that kind of tear things up and and some some You know god fear start to believe and then some full-blown Gentiles come in and some of the jews come in and the the jews are having a lot of anxiety about these gentiles and the And in axe 15 the jerusalem church has to weigh into it and and it's a messy messy place And and when I look at the the kinds of challenges that that christendom and the christian church is going to be facing For the next hundred years It is going to be a messy place. Well, it has been a messy place We've just kept things neat and compartmentalized with denominations So you've got the roman catholics and the orthodox and and how many tens of thousands of protestant denominations? And so it is a messy place, but in the very long view These things get worked out and and so You know, I i'm not going to tell people don't sharpen your ears with respect to heresy It's good to challenge what we're not going to do is put anybody on any stakes and burn them up Um, but but it's good to talk these things through and it's good to challenge and so that's that's part of my Motivation in this commentary series on on jordan peterson is I want to talk back and I want to challenge some things and some things He says and I think oh man, that's right and that challenges other parts of my mind Matrix and my framework and and sometimes he says things I say, no that can't be right Sometimes I I hear him say things in that well, that's just wrong So but but this is the process and this is the process by which by which we grow together now Again, i've done three videos the first video why bother which is really the prolegomena to the prolegomena That was one of the first videos I did with this new format And there are a lot of sound problems. I've got a lot of comments about those sound problems I'm, sorry, maybe i'll go back and redo that video at some point, but um, i'm much more of a I'm not a very good editor I I I do one take with things and and then I move on because I do these things because they interest me I don't have a I don't have a um a pathion account I'm the pastor of a church and so i'm you know in little pieces of time I carve out time to do these little videos and then there might be a little while where I don't do one because I've got my day job to do but but i'm trying to work through this jordan peterson stuff and I guess I found him late summer. I I jumped in in the summer series because it was july so I've been in this thing six months now and and i'm not tired of it yet So i'm going to keep working on it So the first video was why bother and the second video was I looked at nichi and peterson And and harris and weinstein and the third video I looked at jung because jung's been fascinating me I didn't know much about jung and so i'm reading his autobiography now now now that really goes up to minute 47 in peterson's videos and peterson rambles and i'm i'm not Saying that's a bad thing because i'm doing the same thing right now but there's a there's a segment from from minute 47 to um to minute one Uh to minute 105 when when it's pretty disorganized and I haven't quite figured out if i'm going to treat that section If i'm just going to let it run and add some comments to that section Uh, there's a lot of interesting stuff in that section a lot of stuff that's duplicated from his other videos But i'm I haven't quite sure if i'm going to treat that if i'm going to take the time to do that or not Then there's peterson's approach which is is more structured And and there's a lot of interesting stuff in there, too I haven't dealt with that but i'm a pastor and so I have to preach this sunday on john one And and so I thought oh good I want to kill two birds at once with one stone so peterson talks about the logos and john one and and so I thought You know since I have to study this this week anyway to prepare for my sermon I thought I might jump in and just do that section now. So this is peterson on on logos Of course Okay now to understand the first part of genesis i'm going to turn Strangely enough now again, he's he's gonna try to start the bible which he Can't really do in this first one, which is which is hilarious and it's endearing and it's adorable in many ways Because when he said, you know, i'm gonna go through the whole bible these 12 things i'm thinking You're not even gonna get close. You're not even gonna get halfway through the book of genesis. There's especially genesis It's such an amazing book. It's such a fertile book You're not even gonna get there So he's gonna start with genesis and now he's gonna interestingly jump right to right to john one and the logos to Something that's actually part of the new testament and this is a central element of christianity And it's a very strange idea and it's going to take a very long time to unpack but The idea and he says it's going to take a long time to unpack and here's the thing about peterson as i'm and i'm starting to Try to organize. Okay, so i'm i'm bringing i'm saying bringing some logos to his chaos as I watch through these videos and and There's a lot of chaos and and so He doesn't always follow through with some of these things which which again is fine He's he's doing exactly what he he's told us he wants to do and so i'm i'm thrilled. He's doing it Idea this is what john said about christ He said in the beginning was the word and so that relates back to genesis one in the beginning was the word And the word was with god and the word was god some Well, you know three sentences like that take a lot of unpacking because only one thing Because well, none of that seems to make any sense whatsoever really right in the beginning was the word And the word was both with god and the word was god So the first question might be what in the world does that mean in the beginning was the word? That's the logos actually And the logos is embodied in the figure of christ so there's this idea and john that whatever Now after I get through i'm going to do a lot more talking about the logos because this is this is a big deal Whatever christ is the son of god is not only instantiated in history Say at a particular time and place as a as a carpenter in some backwoods part of the world But also something eternal that exists up outside of time and space that was there right at the beginning And as far as I can tell what that logos represents is something like modern people It's something like what modern people refer to when they talk about consciousness. It's something like that. It's more than that. It's like Consciousness and its capacity to to be aware and its capacity to communicate That's such an interesting interpretation of the logos that I think you'd only get from a a someone who you know is a phd in psychology and studies this and and I find that I find that so intriguing and refreshing and You know, i'd really that's that's it's just it's just fascinating It's something like that and there's an idea underneath that which is that being especially from a phenomenological perspective So the being that is experienced cannot exist without consciousness It's like consciousness shines a light on things to bring it into being because without consciousness What is there? No one experiences anything and two I think this is This is this is so in this is so intriguing to me and I I think about that idea one of the one of the things I often think about but part part of a question I often deal with in in terms of the the subjective is Here's the question. Can I know myself in some ways? My wife and my kids know me better than I know myself in another way I know myself better than my wife and my kids can because obviously i'm from the inside. I've And and so and so then you have the question What am I who am I can I be known? And and then you have the christian idea of the audience of one And and when I think about say the resurrection that that god would Knit me back together with the body and I think you could only knit someone back together If you really knew them and then in the christian tradition you say, you know, basically The logos that peterson's connecting with it here and I'd never connected that with the logos before but but here Only god can really know us because only god can actually transcend the objective and the subjective And and only god could finally know paul vanderclay Better than paul vanderclay can know himself better than his wife or his kids could know him better than his his best friends could know him And and that kind of knowledge and and even better than I can be known in this realm of rebellion and sin And and so this idea of you know, is there anything unless there's a seer? Well, if you're a christian, there's a divine seer Now, what does that mean? Mean It's like is there is there anything when no one experiences anything that's the question and the answer that this book is Presenting is that no you have to think about consciousness as a constituent element of reality It's something that's necessary for reality itself to exist now, of course, it depends on what you mean by reality But the reality that's being referred to here I told you already is this strange amalgam of the subjective experience and the world But the question is deeper than that too because it is by no means obvious what there is if there's no one to experience it When he said the strange amalgam between The subjective in the world he was referring back to chaos as he was talking about that chaos is the strange amalgam between the the subjective in the world and I think that too is a That's such a helpful insight and when we when we actually start digging into genesis 1 I think we're gonna have to talk about chaos and and Yeah, well and when I yeah I mean the whole notion of time itself seems to collapse at least in terms of something like felt duration and then And again, you can read c.s. Lewis on time Nobody nobody knows nobody knows how this stuff works. I mean peterson is that's one of the things I appreciate but appreciate about him He is he is dead on right that there's so much of this stuff We just simply don't know the the notion of size disappears essentially because there's nothing to scale it and the causality Seems to vanish and so and and we don't understand consciousness not in the least We don't understand what it is that is in us that gives illumination to being And this is where you know, I I've been rereading again started reading again C.s. Lewis's book miracles and and The the naturalist as c.s. Lewis talks about and I want to go through that first chapter and define that term pretty sharply the the naturalist Finally has a problem I think with consciousness And and again, that's that's back in my union committee back there and they're still working on that But but but that's that's that's something that I that I think is true And what happens in the Old Testament at least in part is that that consciousness is associated with the divine Now you think well, is that a reasonable proposition? And that's a very complicated question, but at least we might note that there's something to the claim because There is a miracle of experience and existence that's dependent on consciousness I mean people try to explain it away constantly but it doesn't seem to work very well And here's something else to think about I think that's really worth thinking about people do not like it when you treat them like they're not conscious Right. They react very badly to that And again, this is this is part of what I really enjoy about peterson is that he's we've been dealing with a rather esoteric thing And now he comes down to a tremendously practical aspect Which a clinician would know and which a pastor would know and which a social worker and a doctor and a nurse would know That that what is this about us that dang it we we demand to be treated in a certain way And then you don't like it if someone assumes that you're not conscious and you don't like it if someone assumes that you don't have free will You know And and this again when you look at a lot of the interesting brain books that have been written I mean free will is very much up for debate and in a whole community there But yet it's it's almost impossible to imagine Our civilization and our entire mode of being without the assumption of free will and this is again where Where we are so deeply embedded in our culture and in our past that that peterson is dead right that you don't just throw this away And that's why nichi is right in that, you know, hey, you're you're living off it, baby You know, you're going to admit that or you're just going to continue to live in denial that you're just absolutely determined in your in your Actions and there's nothing that's going to repair you and that you don't need to have any responsibility for your actions It's like our culture the laws of our culture are predicated on the idea something like people are conscious people have experience People make decisions and can be held responsible for them that there's a free will element to it And you can debate all that philosophically and find but the point is is that That is how we act and that is the idea that our legal system is predicated on and there's something And again, you know peterson started out being interested in law And and so this is something that he comes back to often and of course the the debate in ontario about c16 where this comes into This is this again, you know very much a part of peterson think deep about it because you know You're subject to the law But the law is also limited by you which is to say that in in a well functioning Properly grounded democratic system you have Intrinsic value that's the source of your rights Even if you're a murderer We have to say the law could only go so far because there's something about you that's divine and and this again is This again is the working out of the mago day in genesis that came through judaism came through christianity Became instantiated in our laws is fully manifest in humanism, which you know, if you listen to sam harris He's a humanist if you listen to brett weinstein He's a humanist this this humanism is a direct result of christianity and a direct consequence of the bible and as and as nicklas Waltersdorf the point he made if we lose the amago day Will we lose humanism and if we lose humanism? Um What will that look like and and anyone who's lived through the 20th century? It's gotta have you know gotta be gotta be deeply concerned about this now. I've I've mentioned um uval harari And his his books home his books. Um, his book sapien and homo deus On one hand I I his books are tremendously fun to read but but the end of homo deus is pretty chilling and In terms of in terms of where this is going and I appreciated brett weinstein's comments in the joe rogan about about google We we we don't know where all this is going Well, what does that mean? Well partly it means that there's something about you that's conscious and capable of communicating like you're a whole world into yourself And you have that to contribute to everyone else and that's valuable I mean that you can learn new things you can transform the structure of society You can invent a new way of dealing with the world. You're capable of all that. It's an intrinsic part of you And that's associated with this It's associated. That's the idea there is that there's something about the logos That is necessary for the absolute chaos of the reality beyond experience to manifest itself as reality That's an amazing idea because it gives consciousness A constitutive role in the cosmos and you can debate that but you know, it's not you can't just bloody well brush it off Because first of all we are the most complicated things there are that we know of by by a massive by by a massive amount We're so complicated that it's unbelievable And so, you know, there's a lot of cosmos out there But there's a lot of cosmos in here too and which one is greater is by no means obvious Unless you use something trivial like relative size, which you know really isn't a very sophisticated approach And whatever it is that is you has this capacity to experience reality and to transform it Which is very strange thing, you know, you can conceptualize a future in your imagination And again cs lewis's book on on miracles how cs lewis deals with nature nature is our Nature is our brother or our sister and nature is an accommodating host that The way we talk If you are a if you are a naturalist materialist None of our language makes sense anymore but Because but but nature we we we wade into nature and we change the world and even in our language If I if I hold up, you know if I hold up a paperclip we say This isn't natural. Well, if you're a naturalist Everything is natural and and so again here peterson is is dead on and then you can work and make that manifest You participate in the process of creation. That's one way of thinking about it And so that's why I think in in genesis one It really it relates the idea that human beings are made in the image of the divine Men and women which is interesting too because you know the feminists Are always criticizing christianity for example as being um, what inexorably patriarchal Or as they criticize everything like that, so it's it's hardly a stroke of bloody brilliance but I think it's an absolute miracle that right at the beginning of the document it says straightforwardly like with no hesitation whatsoever that The divine spark which were associated And i'm i'm going to kvetch at his use of the divine spark. It's a fairly specific term You'll find it in the quaker movement. For example, I I think you know this is where someone with a theological education starts to kvetch because um Someone with the imago dei I would rather say than a than a divine spark But his his point here though too about um, you know man and the woman he made You know he made in his image. He made them Is is really important and I think if if say you read that and you read say gilgamesh alongside of it and enkidu and the shrine prostitute and What what struck me when I first read gilgamesh was how how gilgamesh is this it's almost a buddy story The two main characters in gilgamesh are basically it's gilgamesh and the gods make a help meat for gilgamesh And it's enkidu. It's another man now now both of these guys. I mean they're getting plenty of sex they're going and doing manly things and You know It's it's jarring to read then genesis 2 Where where god basically takes eve out of not his rib The story almost cuts him in half. Uh, john peugeot has a nice little icon on his On his video of eve coming out of adam's side and I thought wow, that's that's awesome I I loved I love that image because because that's what the text is liking, you know and then adam sees bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh and You get this well, this is even the conservative christians who are complementarians who don't believe in women in in church office Well, well, this is their great point that that that men and women complement each other That that the help meat for a man is a woman And that that's a I think in many ways a critique of gilgamesh where the the the the help meat of a man is another man and and women are there to maybe civilize men with sex and prepare food for them and And serve them but women are in gilgamesh almost a lesser creature And and again, you will find that throughout the ancient world and here at the beginning of the bible you have and you have The man and the woman are in the image of god and whereas And of course equality is a very complicated subject that I want to be careful with that right now Men and women are both image bearers of god and so there's in many ways a a fundamental equality That you find right there in genesis one and and that equality I think in some ways has has been A prophetic voice throughout the history of the church that to the to the good the to the degree that the church Does not own up to You know Equality is such a hard word, but but does not own up to the equal status of women before god The church has to answer for this And and so does the community And and again, you don't you know to my to the people on the left who who love to hear me say that about women But but don't imagine there's a divine judgment. I think you can't have one without the other It's it's a it's a it's a united thing and and all cultures wobble around and we get a few things, right? We get a few things wrong and some of the good stuff we forget and and some of the good stuff We pull back and remember that's just how life in the age of decay is but um, there it is in genesis and Associating with the word that brings forth being is manifest in men and women equally That's a very cool thing and you got to think well, like I said, you actually take that seriously Well, what you got to ask is what happens if you don't take it seriously? Right that that's read read dostoevsky's crime and punishment That's the best The best investigation of that Tactic that's ever been produced because what happens in Dostoevsky's crime and punishment is that the main character whose name is Raskolnikov Decides that there's no intrinsic value to other people and that as a consequence he can do whatever he wants It's only cowardice that stops him from acting right because Why would it be anything else if other people if the value of other people is just an arbitrary? Superstition then why can't I do exactly what I want when I want which is the psychopath's viewpoint? Well, so Raskolnikov does he kills someone who's a very horrible person and he has very good reasons for killing her And he's half starved and a little bit insane and possessed by this ideology It's brilliant brilliant layout and he finds out something after he kills her which is that The post killing Raskolnikov and the pre-killing Raskolnikov are not the same person even a little bit Because he's broken a rule like he's broken a serious rule and there's no going back And crime and punishment is the best investigation I know of of what happens if you take the notion that there's nothing divine about the individual seriously and Just a little interjection here One of the things that's going to stalk us in this are questions about natural law And and and in a sense peterson has just made a natural law argument now you Know Most of the people I know who are deeply atheistic and I mean I understand why they're deeply atheistic They haven't contended with people like Dostoevsky not as far as I can tell Because I don't see logical flaws in crime and punishment. I think he got the psychology exactly right And that's a that's an interesting comment, too I I think you know, there's there's always this there's always this bias that we have that the the the Context and the worldview that we've been formed into It's a it's a self-serving bias because we think oh, that's obviously the superior one um, but but we hold that position because it's probably the only one we have and and whether you're an atheist or a christian or Or some other some other religion. Um, it's you know That's at some point you've got a like the hobbit get out your front door and go out into the world and and meet some other people and and your And what the package that you were given by your parents and by the situation of your upbringing is going to be challenged And what will you do with it? And he Dostoevsky is amazing for this because in one of his books the devils for example He describes a political scene scenario that's not much different than the one we find herself in now And there are these people who are possessed by rationalistic utopian atheistic ideas and they're very powerful They give rise to the communist revolution, right? I mean they're powerful ideas and his character Stavragon also acts out the The presupposition that human beings have no intrinsic nature and no intrinsic value and it's another brilliant investigation in Dostoevsky Prophecies that's what I would say what will happen to a society if it goes down that road and he was dead Exactly accurate. It's uncanny to read Dostoevsky's the possessed or the devils depending on the translation and then to read alexander solzhenitsyn's gulag archipelago Because one is fiction and prophecy and the second is hey look it turned out exactly the way that Dostoevsky said it would for Exactly the same reasons so it's quite remarkable So well so the question is do you contend seriously with the idea that a there's something cosmically constitutive about consciousness and B that that might well be considered divine and see that that is instantiated in every person and then ask yourself if you're not a criminal if you don't act it out and Then ask yourself what that means is that reflective of a reality? You know is it a metaphor like maybe it's a metaphor a complex metaphor that we have to use to organize our societies could well be but Even as a metaphor. It's it's true enough so that we mess with it at our peril and and this again Peterson's going right to his line and this is when I listen to Peterson I hear him working this stuff out because is it is it just a metaphor is it But but but what even does that mean? And yeah, and it also took people a very long time to figure out Okay, and that's now we're at 150 and now he he moves on he moves on from there In the beginning in the beginning was the word and the word was God and the word was with God and I get my slides unordered yes, and and I think you know the the One of the things I want to do is is raise, you know some some of you Well, I'll just share good things that I have one of the if you if you're interested in the Gospel of John Raymond Brown's anchor Bible series if you're interested in biblical commentaries don't buy series generally speaking you you you cherry-pick some of the best books and As you can see from Amazon way and get some cheap But this is this is a classic on the Gospel of John Raymond Brown is a Roman Catholic scholar and he there were there were few who knew The the Joe it's called in biblical studies the Joanne tradition better than Raymond Brown and his His two volumes set on the Gospel of John is simply a classic and on the logos. There's a great. There's a great appendix Not getting any younger There's a great appendix where where he goes through and and talks about the difficulty in determining the background of the first verse of the fourth Gospel in the beginning was the word is illustrated dramatically in Gerta's Faust When Faust begins to translate the New Testament into German He starts with the prologue only to find that word is an inadequate translation His alternate suggest his his alternate Suggestions come from the strange combination of Greek and German philosophy in the beginning was the thought In the beginning was the power At the end enlightened by the spirit Faust triumphantly proclaims the real translation in the beginning was the act Modern investigations into the background of the joining use of the word are as varied if not as romantic For reference to what follows the reader's attention is called to the bibliography given in the prologue and and so then And Raymond Brown starts then going through You know the the Hellenistic background and and this word has a you know has a powerful history Heraclitus in Ephesus, and if you know anything about John studies You know John you know the Ephesus was kind of the center of the perhaps the Joannine community It was at Ephesus that the traditional site of John's Gospel that Heraclitus in the sixth century BC first introduced Logos into Greek philosophical thought striving to explain the continuity amid all the flux that is visible in the universe Heraclitus resorted to Logos as the eternal principle of order in the universe the Logos is what makes the world a cosmos For the for the Stoics who are one of the if you listen to NT Wright, I mean the two big Greek Philosophical traditions in Hellenism that that really gripped the Empire at this time even the Epicureans and the Stoics For the Stoics the Logos is the mind of God a rather pantheistic God who penetrates all things Guiding controlling and directing all things Philo a Jewish philosopher who really who really Who really tried to meld his his Jewish upbringing in the Jewish faith with with Platonism Philo used the Logos theme over 1200 times in his work and his attempts to bring together the Greek and the Hebrew worlds of thought For Philo the Logos created by God was the intermediary between God and his creatures God's Logos was what gave meaning and plan to the universe It was also a second it was almost a second God the instrument of God and creation in the pattern of the human soul However, neither the personality nor the pre-existence of the Logos was clear in Philo and the Philonian Logos was not connected to life In the later Hellenistic literature Logos was an expression of the mind of God helping to create and order the world In the Mandean liturgies we hear the word of life for the light of life etc. These are distant echoes of borrowing from Christian thought As for the more general field of Gnosticism the word occurs in the newly discovered Gospel of Truth The word who came from the the Pleroma who is in the thought and the mind of the Father the word who is who is also called the Savior It is plausible that the Valentinian Gnostic use has been influenced by John since the Gospel of Truth is considered later than John In evaluating some of these examples one must remember that the Gospel of John and some of these Hellenistic works had a common heritage and wisdom literature in the Old Testament Which certainly influenced Philo and some of the Gnostic odes and that parallels can therefore be traced back to the Semitic roots Again the parallels between the Prologue and the Hellenistic literature are often on the surface level For example the Logos is related to creation The deep blending of the Prologue motifs of Genesis 1-3 in the beginning, creation, light, life, darkness against light And that of the Sinai Theophany, tenter tabernacle, glory, enduring love Suggests that the basic imagery of the hymn comes from the Old Testament The activity of the word in creation in the world and above all in the history of salvation indicates that this concept is closer to the dynamic implications of the Hebrew Dabbar Than the intellectual abstraction implicit in the philological usages of the Greek Logos When one reads the hymn of the Prologue and compares it to the Hellenistic parallels suggested above One realizes the truth of Augustine's remark from the Confessions That while he found the equivalent of most Christian doctrines and pagan authors There was one thing that he never read in them, that the word became flesh The basic theme of the Prologue is strange to the Hellenistic parallels that have been offered And so let us see a better background that may be found in biblical and Jewish thought And then he goes into again the word of the Lord in the Old Testament Which is an amazing thing to see The personification of wisdom in wisdom literature both in extra-canonical Jewish literature and in the canonical literature in the Bible Jesus as personified wisdom and how wisdom in wisdom literature was there with God in creation And so you hear that in John's, you hear that in John's The Bible, the Bible, the Bible, the Bible, the Bible, the Bible, the Bible The Bible, the Bible, the Bible, the Bible, the Bible, the Bible And so you hear that in John's, you hear that in John's, in John's Prologue The Jewish speculation of the law And a little later in Peterson's thing he'll go through his, kind of his attributes of God He's only got about seven minutes to finish it up because he ran out of time And I'm trying to remember back if he actually goes back over that carefully, I wish he would Jewish speculation of the law, the relationship between the logos and the law And then the Targum use which was Aramaic of Memra When John cites scripture as we've seen Sometimes the citation is taken from neither the Hebrew nor the Septuagint Which is the first century Greek translation of the Old Testament into the Greek But from the Targums or the Aramaic translations In these Targums, Memra, Aramaic for word, has a special function The Memra of the Lord in the Targums is not simply a translation Of what we have spoken as of the word of the Lord Rather it is a surrogate for God himself If you read in Colossians, if you read it in the Greek That Jesus is the icon of the invisible God And of course for those in the orthodox tradition who are used to dealing with icons Not from an iconoclastic tradition like more Protestant traditions This surrogate for God himself If in Exodus 312 God says I will be with you in the Targum God says my Memra will be your support In Exodus 19, 17 we are told that Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God In the Targum we are told that he was brought to the Memra of God If Genesis 28, 21 says Yahweh shall be my God The Targum speaks of the Memra of Yahweh This is not a personification But the use of Memra serves as a buffer for divine transcendence And again so when you see this the word becomes flesh in the Gospel of John And you understand this say through the Targum and through the Aramaic And we know that the author of the Gospel of John used the Aramaic translation often of the Old Testament You can see this coming through now in this logos in the word of God If Aramaic expression word was used in Targum as a paraphrase for God and his dealings with men The author of the prologue hymn may have seen fit to use this title for Jesus Who preeminently incorporated God's presence among men The personification of the word would of course be part of the Christian theological innovation In some it seems that the prologue's description of the word is far closer to the biblical and the Jewish strains of thought Than anything purely Hellenistic In the mind of the theologian of the prologue the creative word of God The word of the Lord that comes to the prophets has been personal in Jesus Who is the embodiment of divine revelation Jesus' divine wisdom pre-existent but now come among men to teach them and give them life Not the Torah but Jesus Christ is the creator and source of light and life He is the Memra, God's presence among men And yet even though all these strands are woven into the Joannine concept of the word This concept remains a unique contribution of Christianity It is beyond all that has gone before it Even as Jesus is beyond all who have gone before Before we close we may ask about one more point Is the revelation of God in the word formulated against the background of God's previous silence? And then he goes into that because part of what the first century Jewish community was straining with Under their in a sense house arrest exile of the Roman Empire Why has God not sent a prophet? Why has God not sent a voice? Someone to rescue us and then of course the New Testament the Gospel writers all begin with John And is he a prophet? John says no Is he a prophet? Jesus says yes This is again another great example of the Bible having this conversation Well how can John and Jesus disagree? Well they'll disagree on love and they're going to talk about it and they're going to work it through And we're invited into the conversation to work these things through Now I wanted to end with this Somebody that I've a friend I've recently made through making these videos A pastor in Canada who I'm probably going to have a conversation with at one point Pointed me to this video that isn't in the Jordan Peterson Isn't in the Jordan Peterson channel it's in the John Peugeot channel And it is an event that John and Jordan Peterson and some I don't have I know the Orthodox have their own terminology The Orthodox priests spoke at this event And so this is where Peterson gets into because the topic of the event was the resurrection of the logos And part of what's so beautiful about the Orthodox tradition is that they haven't kind of been diced and sliced through Through all the different language transformations that say Protestants have had to go through But part of what is beautiful about this is here is Peterson in a place Which is really kind of funny and what I really enjoy about And I'll just play the little part of the speech I'll put the link for it in the notes But what I enjoy about part of this speech is that he's so affected And I wonder as a preacher sometimes you preach in some places and some context And you're affected by the context and I think this is Peterson I think in some ways opening his heart and the sound quality isn't good And that's not unusual for churches but again you can look up the video yourself and play the whole thing But I just wanted to play the part that he talked about the logos So I'm going to start with a hypothesis I spend a lot of time thinking about religious symbolism and archetypes But there's a problem with that and the problem is It lacks concretization to think about the ultimate ideal as only something that's symbolic And again I think this is where Peterson comes right up to his edge and what does this mean? The word becomes flesh and tabernacles with us It moves away from the real world and it's partly for this reason that there's an insistence in Christianity That the logos is two things at once. It took me a long time to figure this out I was guided in my attempts to understand it by Carl Jung who was a truly remarkable person And probably orthodox in his fundamental convictions I would say He talked about the logos as the thing that existed at the beginning of time And this is a very particular way of looking at things and so the idea is essentially that as Jonathan pointed out That there's something about consciousness that calls forth being from chaotic potential And you all understand what this means because when you look at the future or if you look at yourselves You know that what you confront is a field of potential and everyone tells you that And I think when we dive into Genesis 1 more, this I think is a gospel articulation that Especially the Protestant churches have not fully mined is the relationship with chaos in Genesis 1 And actually throughout the Old Testament and all the way to the book of Revelation where there isn't any sea And this is something I think Peterson is making a contribution with They tell you you're not living up to your potential and potential is a very strange thing because it doesn't yet exist And so by the canons of say modern science, it's not something that has any reality whatsoever But everyone knows precisely what it it means and everything around you is full of potential because you can interact with it and bring forth new things And you know that and you can be called for your failure to do it and you You call you call out yourself for your failure to do it because you wake up at three in the morning and you and you torture yourself With your inability to bring forth the potential that's within you and it haunts your soul and it's hellish And the reason it's hellish is because it is hellish and if you don't call forth the potential that's within you and outside of you Then the world does transform into hell because that's its tendency anyways And we've had no shortage of evidence of that in the last 100 years It's part of the Christian doctrine that at the beginning of time The logos of Yawa Operate on potential and brought forth habitable the habitable world order and it was perfect in some strange sense It was the paradise in which Adam and Eve were placed in the paradise was a walled garden a well watered place And the walled garden is a place of order and chaos culture and nature and that's because people inhabit a garden of culture and nature That that's that's our environment and if those two properties are properly balanced then inside that garden everyone can flourish And human beings are in principle made in the image of that logos And that's why we can speak things into being and we do and when you speak truth then you speak paradise into being and when you speak falsely you speak hell into being And that's the truth and what that means is that with every decision that you make You decide for yourself and for everyone else whether you're going to tilt the world a little bit more towards hell or a little bit more towards heaven And that's the burden you bear for your existence and the choices that you make as you pass through life and it's the fleeing from that And that's at the bottom of the nihilism of postmodernism and the escape into the totalitarian certainties of idol worship And none of this is fictional because we've seen the consequences And I think that's that's just such a You listen to this guy and you don't get the sense he's being duplicitous He is he is he is he is serious about what he's doing and he believes it and you know when he talks about I believe him I believe him when he talks about this and it's this is this is his calling and he's pursuing it Where will it go will the new order come out of the chaos I don't know we'll see so again thanks for thanks for watching And if you like it if this helps you just leave me a comment just say hey I liked it or or you can say you suck or shave or grow more hair or just turn it off But I I am processing I am processing this as part of my work process and asking if this is I know if if this is fruitful and so far I found it to be fruitful And I'm again just really grateful for the comments and the new leads that that this has brought me so thanks for watching and again I I hope it's helpful
