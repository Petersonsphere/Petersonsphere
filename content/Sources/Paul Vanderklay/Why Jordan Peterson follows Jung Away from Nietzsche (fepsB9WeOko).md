 Hi, my name is Paul. I'm the pastor of Livingstone's Christian Reformed Church in Sacramento, and I'm doing a series of videos on Jordan Peterson. I've been fascinated by his presentations, and I've wanted to engage with them, and so I figured YouTube seemed about the best place to do it, and so far based on comments, it's proven right. This seems to be a place that I can talk about what I'm discovering. I'm still working through his biblical series, Lesson 1. I call this a prolegomena because I think really what he does, if you study theology, most of what his first lecture is really is prolegomena. Where do we found the things that we're talking about? And one of the early slides he has, he begins with Nietzsche, and in my last video, which was very long, most of it, just pieces from Peterson and various interviews, I dealt mostly with Nietzsche and now Jung. I want to do a little brief review of what I dealt with in the last one. I talked about the fact that medieval Christianity and Christendom possessed Europe in many ways and possessed the West, and as Peterson noted, Nietzsche's observation was that discipline the European mind and focused it. Now, along comes the Protestant Reformation after, kind of in the light of Renaissance humanism, Martin Luther, Erasmus, a whole generation of scholars are getting back to the sources, and there's this huge split in the church, and to a certain degree, the split in the church is over authority. Now, this is a very low resolution representation of what I'm talking about, but you have Sola Scriptura, where the Protestant churches say that scripture is the basis of our knowledge, and that's a nuanced position from the Roman Catholic position, which said that, for example, the church, in a sense, produces scripture, or the church gives birth to scripture, whereas the Protestants said the church recognizes scripture, and the Protestants wanted to make the scripture, make the Bible the arbiter, the judge, the playing field by which contradictory interpretations of the Bible could be adjudicated and resolved. The difficulty of the Protestant Reformation was that never really happened, that in fact the church fractured how many different ways, and that happened nearly right from the beginning. And so after the Reformation, there was a hundred years of war between Protestants and Catholics. Now, these wars were not just about religion. Religion and politics were all intertwined. That was, if you read some of the current stuff on the Protestant Reformation, I mean, that's just a factor of the conflict. And so there was a whole generation of people who said, this is crazy how we're killing each other. We need to found a new basis for agreement and for life, so that we're not killing each other over religious interpretation. Now, ideally, they would have come up with one thing, but in fact, Europe was looking back over the Classical period, and it really split into two things. You had rationalism, which is in a sense up in the cloud. It's disconnected from the world. It's pure reason. I think, therefore I am. On first principles, we can deduce what is truth. And then empiricism, which is kind of from the bottom, which is looking at the stuff of nature, and nature will ground us. And you can see in some ways you have heaven and earth with these two positions. And in some ways that when they come together, in some ways they form science, because science, as Peterson notes in that one clip I showed in the last video, science tries to get rid of all individuality and come up with a principle, a transcending principle to make individuality coherent. So in a sense, science does kind of put rationalism and empiricism together, but still the kind of unity Europe really can't come up with. But at the same time now, they find this system to be a better system, and we'll engage Sam Harris a little bit later in this, they find this to be a better system in a sense than fighting about the Bible, because people with differing interpretations of the Bible can agree with some of these things, either by reason or by observation. And then of course that leads Nietzsche to his death of God observation. Now after, as Peterson said, Nietzsche is in a sense the prophet of what is to come, and according to Peterson, Europe will now swing between nihilism and ideologies. And a little bit later I'll show a clip about how Peterson regards ideologies. Of course Darwin comes along, and if you read the book The Metaphysical Club, part of the point that that book makes is that plenty of Christians were assuming that God used processes for evolution. And Darwin's big statement was that we didn't need God to account for the world. And so therefore a lot of these medieval arguments that for many people in common sense that of course there's a God, because how can we account for the order we see in this world? Now Darwin comes along and says it's a process of natural selection. We don't need a God to produce this world. This world can be produced, we imagine we can see a process without a divine hand that can produce the world. And so in many ways progressive ideas and the idea of progress rolls through Europe and it takes on different shapes. And again some of this is Yuval Harari's idea that really what the 20th century was was three competing humanisms. And again when we get to Sam Harris, it's important to see that Sam Harris and Brett Weinstein are all humanists. Nick Waltersdorf, who again is a philosopher from my tradition taught at Calvin College and then at Yale Divinity School, Nick Waltersdorf made the observation a number of years ago that humanism is based on the Imago Dei. This is all based on the idea that God made us in our in his image and that gives humanity a privileged position over the rest of creation. What will happen to humanism when we give up the Imago Dei? So what happens in the 20th century is that the Nazis believe in some idea of progressive racial evolution and that fuels their ideas of exterminating the Jews and exterminating supposedly you know sub-optimal races and of course Nazis lose World War Two. Now the Soviet Union gets going and just on the heels of World War One and they have this idea of progressive class evolution and so they're trying to apply their ideas of class evolution and as Brett Weinstein noted, their doctrine and really the doctrine of both of these groups hinders them and they in fact lose the struggles of the 20th century and what emerges is the West and the West also has progressivist ideas but the West in a sense believes they're more Darwinian in a sense and that they believe in the market and the market is a place of a place of competition and it's competition between economic factors and it's competition between ideas and it's competition between moralities and this is the idea that the West says well this is what's driving progress. It's the competition between all of these forces and we need to let them play. This very much is an expression and really an evolution of West classical Western liberalism. Now the difficulty that we wind up with however is okay so we can account for the creation of the world and the differentiation of animals and the physics of the sun and the planets coming together with these with these rocks as they cool and we can account for all of this and somewhere again between rationalism and empiricism but we can't come what we can't account for is morality and you'll often hear Peterson talking about Hume that you can't get an ought from an is and as we saw in the lectures with some of the debates with Sam Harrison I'll play and the ones with the ones with Weinstein both Sam Harrison Weinstein on wonder on one hand say we can account for how we are and what we do to a great degree by evolution. This is how we can account for who we are but now both of them will say but evolution is immoral. They would at least say evolution is amoral but as I as in the clips I played last time both of them critique evolution and say evolution is immoral and I think part of this comes about again because of the Nazi experience. Before the second world war if you read broadly the late 19th early 20th century you will find many many scholars touting you know what we would look upon today as racist ideologies and and these things were simply common for educated people. What happens during World War II is that we see in in Nazi Germany the horrible logical conclusion of this thinking and we draw back from it and we say well this is immoral. Now I completely agree 100 percent the the you know World War II wiped out a bunch of my distant cousins who didn't emigrate from Europe but on what basis can you call this immoral? Can you make can you fashion a Darwinian argument and if so why are some Darwinian observations moral and some Darwinian observations immoral? So what we are left with again is exactly where we were left at the end of the Protestant Reformation which is can we find morality from rationalism from above? Can we find morality from empiricism from below? Now what I think this has led to is that we had a generation of really a number of generations of people waiting to say well upon what can we found morality? And I think in many ways the world stopped waiting and and what has taken its place is I'm gonna I'm gonna mention C.S. Lewis's book Miracles which is one of my favorite books and I can't get it out of my face one of my favorite books and and a book that I try to read two or three times a year simply because Lewis is so perceptive and at sussing through nature and now Lewis is a rationalist and so I think most people either tend to come from above or tend to come from below so so Lewis is is a rationalist and he's a you know he he likes Plato and that's just who Lewis is but where's it going with this? But Lewis begins to say you know that the kind of the natural human state is is a rather pantheistic state and in terms of our our religious assumptions assumptions if you leave humanism alone if you leave people alone they will kind of on their on their own either devolve or evolve to to a rather pantheist religion. Now one of the one of the fine books of a couple years ago is David Brooks The Road to Character and and David Brooks at the beginning of the book talks about where he sees the culture going and as I looked around the popular culture I kept finding the same messages everywhere you are special trust yourself be true to yourself movies from Pixar and Disney are constantly telling children how wonderful they are commencement speeches are larded with the same cliches follow your passion don't accept your limits chart your own course you have responsibility to do great things because you are so great this is the gospel of self-trust as Ellen DeGeneres put it in the 2009 commencement address my advice to you is to be true to yourself and everything will be fine celebrity chef Mario Battili Battali advises graduates to follow their own truth expressed consistently by you Anna Quindlen urges another audience to have the courage to honor your character your intellect your inclinations and yes your soul by listening to its clean clear voice instead of following the muddied messages of a timid world in her mega-selling book Eat Pray Love I am the only man to ever finish the book says Brooks I've never read it Elizabeth Gilbert wrote that God manifests himself through my own voice from within my own self God dwells within you as yourself exactly the way you are now Brooks looks at this and says this is clearly where the culture is going now if I if I look at CS Lewis and this book I hear CS Lewis saying we are in a sense devolving back to this this rather pantheistic posture that that we as human beings tend to assume when we don't have anything else that's moving us now I don't think it's a big jump from this from this pantheism from this internal self-sufficiency that that I am a god and the god is me to this identitarian culture movement that we see Peterson very much engaging because if if I am a god exactly how I am then the whole world ought to adore me and and and the whole whole world ought to make room for me and establish laws for for the great me that I am and everyone must use whatever pronoun I choose to use if I tell my neighbors my pronouns are we I'm going to take on the pronouns of kings and the divine we and and my third person pronoun is his highness so whenever you refer to me please use the pronoun his highness and and the divine me inside demands that the world comply now now this obviously is a as a different posture from modernism which said well there's an objective world out there and and we in fact need to negotiate and come to terms with with this and we in fact can be better in touch with this objective world if we collaborate and communicate together and if I in fact can get beyond my own biases now now this is where we get into the the post-Nichian turn that Peterson makes in his prolegomena where where you'll have in a in effect Sam Harris and and Brett Weinstein producing their own values and and they believe they can and and again if you go back at the other video and you look at what Peterson lectures in terms of his personality class and he's he's quoting Dostoevsky and Dostoevsky is saying you know am I piano keys and and you can read you can read Tolstoy in his in his great um oh I can't remember the the title of the the little book is tiny little memoir that he wrote a little spiritual memoir it's a terrific little book we are if we are just piano keys then you know so what the thing is as both Harris and Weinstein say you can't simply accept the morality of your genes your genes are amoral if not immoral so where do you go from there now this is this is hardly a new thing one of the most important books I think it was written in about in the late aughts maybe 2009 book by a sociologist named Christian Smith and and what Christian Smith did was was interview thousands and or hundreds and thousands of of young teenagers and he wanted to interview them about their religious and their spiritual ideas and and this is what he found he said American everyone decides for themselves American youth like American adults are nearly without exceptional exception profoundly individualistic instinctively presumptive um instinctively presumingly autonomous individual self-direction to be a universal human norm and life goal thoroughgoing individualism is not a contested orthodoxy for teenagers notice the word it's an orthodoxy this is in fact the baseline of our cultural belief it is an invisible and pervasive doxa that's a dogma this is this is what we think in fact this is the bubble within which we live that is an unrecognized unquestioned invisible premise or presupposition US teenagers US teenagers profound individualism informs a number of other issues which he gets into for most teens nobody has to do anything in life including anything to do with religion whatever is fine if that's what a person wants consequently certain traditional religious languages and vocabularies vocabularies of commitment duty I don't know my thing's covering us obedience calling obligation accountability and if you read Brooks's the road to character these are all the things that he's talking about in terms of this transition that our culture's been in since the second world war instead religion is presupposed to be something that individuals choose and must reaffirm for themselves based on their present and ongoing personal felt needs and preferences and in other words find the religion of your choosing second most US teens are at least somewhat allergic to anything they view as trying to influence them now this of course is enormously ironic because we we are immersed in a culture that is usually for market reasons always trying to influence us and and this is part of the this the challenge that that marketing marketing people have because if they get too overt then we recoil and say oh you're trying to influence me so instead of saying buy apple we just show someone who's attractive and appealing and that we esteem using the product and we absorb it that way but oh no I'm not being influenced they generally view themselves as autonomous mediators or arbiters from outside influences and a little bit later when we talk about Charles Taylor we're going to talk about the buffered self we very much imagine ourselves to be buffered selves other people in institutions provide information that youth see themselves as filtering processing and assimilating based on this information they make their own decisions for themselves or the story goes and and what I like to what I like to point out is that often if you talk to someone about Christianity and usually a very common thing people will say is well I don't I don't think it's fair that God would judge let's say someone who grew up in a the Christian God would judge someone who grew up in a Muslim country for not being Christians because you know if they grow up in a Muslim country well they'll be Muslim and that's right we call this sociology of knowledge but here's the funny thing about Americans we all believe in sociology of knowledge but we think that I myself and the exception to it all those people growing up in that Muslim country or all those people growing up in the bush in Africa or all those people growing up in in communist China they're all being influenced by by the culture that's around them but me I somehow stand above it I am not a constructed self I am my own autonomous person who chooses and of course what I choose is clearly what's reasonable and rational and as Garrison Keeler says all the children in Lake Wobegon are above average and so we live in these powerful we are powerful bubble boys like many of the adults who are socializing them they are often highly pro proffered to sit they often readily proffer decisive judgments as obvious facts that take that they take as self-evident to any reasonable person such as obviously you shouldn't hurt anyone else or it's totally wrong to have sex with someone you don't really care about I think that one's probably changing in our culture since the late 90s what almost all US teenagers and adults lack however are any tools or concepts of or rationales by which to connect or integrate their radical relativistic individual individualistic selves on the one hand and their commonsensical evaluative moralistic selves on the other and and we see this today in our in our political polarization we imagine that that the politics that I embrace are so obvious and so self-evident now I wouldn't want to judge anyone but all those other people over there are clearly stupid and need to be jailed or silenced or put away because because they just don't know anything and and what's what strikes me about this position is that this position is so radically difficult to hold if you actually know people of other cultures or read history or or or travel that that we somehow imagine that here we have arrived now it's it's absolutely normal to believe that all of my ideas are right and any ideas that contradict them are wrong because if I didn't believe my ideas were right I would discard them and grab the other ideas I believed is right but but to not have the self-awareness that we ourselves are not exceptions to sociology of knowledge says that we're that we're in many ways bubble boys and girls but the the difficulty is we are as Jordan Peterson often reminds us we are in fact the elites of the world so we are powerful bubble boys and girls and it's often the case that if you travel to other countries and you can watch on YouTube now there's no end of YouTube so people of other countries saying what they think about Americans well you know they see us as different they're they're not within our bubble so so where does this leave us most US most US youth tend to assume an instrumental view of religion now now this is important because in my experience a lot of people decide to leave the church or or stop praying or stop reading their Bible maybe they grew up with these things maybe they didn't now we're we're within there are great many people in the United States who didn't grow up going to church now as as the as the rates of church attendance recede now I should also include Canada obviously because Peterson and many of his audiences are in Canada but but a lot of the assumption underneath the idea of what religion is for even even when you ask the question that way is is instrumental and so and so people have a kind of a a demythologizing story such as you know I sat down and I prayed for my grandmother who had cancer and God didn't hear my prayers and she died therefore I was not able to do that therefore I know there isn't a God and you know on one hand that's a that's a very reasonable approach because the whole problem of evil is founded on this if God is good if God is powerful if God is loving why wouldn't he he heal my grandmother's cancer well that's a very good question but but one thing that we often don't look at is that there's an instrumentalist assumption beneath that and and I want to play a little bit of the a little bit of the interview with with Jordan Peterson and and Sam Harris about what a religion is because I think I think Harris in many ways really boils it down in a succinct way and I think part of the reason Harris has become so popular is because he's been able to articulate the assumptions of a generation so let's let's listen to let's listen to Harris to make of that claim generically I think I think we should talk about your view of Christianity at some point soon to see if we can talk about specifics but I just want to take a generic starting point which for me is more accessible and I think more illuminating it certainly describes the divide between science and religion that resonates with me and I think it connects nicely to the way you were describing kind of our primal circumstance of being an individual or a tribe standing in the face of mute and often hostile nature and trying to figure out what's going on and how to live within it I think that really is the primal circumstance this is what I think of religion as you know as a kind of failed science as a kind of first attempt to tell a story about what's going on that gives us some power over it but it's a bad attempt because we didn't develop any kind of methodology at that point to differentiate fact from fiction we should pause there because pay attention now because he's also located science religion is a sort of failed science to give us power over nature well is that really what science is or is that what we use technology for so he's already kind of blurred science and technology but you notice again what Christian Smith notes is this instrumental assumption as to what religion is and I see this as a pastor all the time with church people come into my church often if it's a first someone coming in who I've had no contact with before they come in they come in desperate they'll they'll come in and after the service pastor I want to join the church oh why do you want to join the church and I know some tragedies happen they might have had a fight with their spouse they're short of money they're looking for help they want me to pray they're hoping that the deacons at the church can can help them out with a financial need they're desperate for something to fix something and they imagine that if they can get this thing fixed then their life can go on as usual now yeah and maybe we can't help them fix their thing maybe they'll just feel better after I'll pray with them and and maybe in fact something will be fixed and they'll say oh it worked but their life will pretty much go on as before but again that expresses this rather this rather instrumental assumption about what religion is for so let's keep listening take the case that every parent will be familiar with of standing helplessly over your sick child wondering what's wrong let's say your child throws up and has a fever and you don't know what's wrong with him or her and this is obviously one of the more the more ancient moments for any person and there's a you know obvious evolutionary reasons why we would be concerned about this and so this is quite darwinian to care what's happening to your your infant but today this primitive uncertainty and helplessness and fear is bracketed by a basic understanding of the processes in the world that can affect a human body and there's obviously enough to worry about there to drive almost any parent crazy but now now again bracketed by what affects the human body now now again pay attention here because okay so a child is sick so they might have a virus again i've been reading the book 1493 and looking at you know how malaria smuggled itself across the ocean and the bodies of of africans and europeans and and just how this works so so on one hand i'm in no way delegitimizing the the reality of of the material world but it's important to recognize that that harris is in is himself setting this up within a frame and and and setting up okay well this is what religion is for one thing that is no longer on the menu is the evil eye when your child gets sick no part of your mind if you're sane is now devoted to the question of whether or not you should go burn your neighbor as a witch now i i love this example because i before i pastored in sacramento i was a missionary and in the dominican republic and so we dealt with these kinds of things all the time now now when he says no one who is sane i i when i hear this i think that's a that's an awfully colonial posture to take now no one who is sane well i would say well maybe a lot of people who are sane but they are living within their own bubble but what makes us think we don't have a bubble what makes us think we don't have a culture now we may very well believe that we are right and and and the question of the evil eye yes someone someone looked at me funny and i think that they put a spell on me and therefore or they put a spell on my child and therefore my child is sick i remember one day i had my child was three or four years old and i had to walk a ways to my home and it was cloudy and was starting to rain i'm holding my child i'm walking to the house and and a frantic woman dominican woman comes up to him and say i say daniel you're hurting your son so why am i hurting my son he's out here in the rain and to me it's like i bathe the kid all the time little water isn't going to hurt him so so on one hand i'm on sam harris's side but at the same time well how about that evil eye when your neighbor looks at you funny and the wheels start to turn in your head and you start to think well are they um are they putting something in my water are they putting something in my food are they are they saying things about me one of the things that we might notice is the other weinstein harvey weinstein here's a guy that goes from the top of the heap all the way to the bottom a man of enormous influence power and money goes all the way to being scumbag of the earth why reputation has anything material changed what in what realm you cannot take what changed with harvey weinstein and put it under a microscope you cannot see it on a slide this is all relational and this relational world is very real so on one hand i i completely well i don't completely agree actually and and we'll get into that um yes if your child is sick see a doctor but what does that mean if you are depressed and you are depressed because everyone in your neighborhood thinks you're a dirt bag can that depression make you sick well then you know you say well that affected my mood and my chemistry okay but now again here c.s lewis makes makes this point here when i decide to move my hand to the controls on this computer what's moving my hand isn't it as c.s lewis and jordan peterson might say spirit isn't in a sense spirit moving my hand well how do we account for that because she might have cast a malicious glance at your child right but as you know that was not always so and in fact in africa people are still murdering their neighbors for the crime of witchcraft so the problem from my point of view sorry about leaving that on during that people in africa are still murdering their neighbors for the crime of witchcraft which which i think is a is a rather funny thing because people and neighbors in africa and the united states and canada are murdering their neighbors because they're jealous of their spouse because they're moving they're murdering their spouses because they said something wrong to them because they haven't filled their expectation we are still murdering people because of thoughts now you might think well that evil eye put a hex on them okay but they looked funny at me and so by road rage i pull out my gun and shoot them is there really a lot of difference now obviously i'm not advocating that we set up and try people for giving the evil eye but we in fact do try people for all kinds of other relational crimes that are in fact relational and not material it's twofold one is that we know that there's a path forward to rule out things like witchcraft and the evil eye and that this path science and rationality generally again also watch the presumptions there's a path forward okay now now i agree this we live in a better world but that is in fact and again another assertion but the other problem is that you could still play this game by resort to ancient stories and finding some connection between those stories and evolution you could play a game of dignifying a belief in magic in this case you know the evil eye specifically along yongyan lines or archetypal lines or something you could be sympathetic with this picture but my point is now again he's he's basically making a moral assertion here that's he's making a moral argument and we might ask well and i agree with him to a certain degree well i think it's better that we not that we not try people for witchcraft but we regularly try people for their relational crimes for hating someone there are there is in fact the category of hate crimes and so what really is the basis for the distinction here that you've got one story over here and another over here and you're saying i have a moral problem with this story okay i have moral problems with lots of stories but why what is your moral foundation where upon what criteria do you state that this morality is problematic what would be the point of that i mean given the obvious harms that we no longer need commit based on disavowing this ancient ignorance why would one spend any time at all trying to make sense of admittedly ancient concern about sympathetic magic what other ancient concerns don't we have what other what other things don't we bring from from the past into our present and this is fundamentally the the difficulty i have with sam harris and that there's a whole bubble around him he is the heir of this of this process that that happens and in renaissance humanism and the protestant reformation and the and the and the grabbing on to uh rationalism and empiricism and the death of god he is the heir of all of this all of this is ancient and in many ways this is exactly the the the point that peterson is making with all of this and saying we're standing on the shoulders do we need to do sifting hey um i sift as much as anyone but but let's ask ourselves you know the broader questions about where this stuff comes from let's see now now again sam sam harris's insta sam harris's religion i wrote this slide a little bit ago now i can't remember what i was going to say um fails fails instrumentally well religion okay this is posture about religion religion fails instrumentally religion fails morally but then the the question that in the sense peterson and nichi are saying what do you replace it with and and the question that they are asking is what can't you see and now if you remember maybe i won't play it right now if you remember brett weinstein and the joe rogan i'll play it anyway brett weinstein basically makes the assertion this is the top level truth as i see it at least there is this overarching truth the one that sam harris was pointing to the one i think you're pointing to also and the one i'm imagining we all subscribe to right there is the testable truth that reveals itself in the laboratory we're in a careful experiment in the field and that really is the top level truth but then there are the truths you can't remember to turn the light here he says again that really is the top level truth well how do you know and then again this this gets back to my argument about the alligator in the pond um i told the story in the last one you visit you visit a you visit a gator farm in florida you see all these alligators and in cement ponds and warm pools sitting there all day throwing in chunks of sand and then you see the alligator in the pond and then you see the alligator in the pond and then in cement ponds and warm pools sitting there all day throwing in chickens and and you say well don't these alligators get bored why don't they just attack each other no they're well fed they're happy there they sit and this is where you get to dostoevsky am i piano key um people are in fact if you feed them yes they're far more well behaved than if you don't feed them but is this the top level truth and and i would assert and i think this is essentially peterson's assertion people don't work this way they really don't and and when i listen to when i when i listen to when i listen to weinstein and harris part of me wants to ask have you do you know people have you met people i i think dostoevsky is is far more insightful in saying no if you if you give someone everything they want tolstoy basically says the same thing and in fact tolstoy lived it he was a successful writer he had a great reputation he had a wonderful group of friends he had had all the money and pleasures he could and what starts eating at him it's the far bigger questions the kinds of questions that religions often ask and so then you have to ask the question well which are the top level truths and what people seem to graduate to is is saying okay well i've got my food i've got my job and in fact i find this with people all the time i have everything set around me now what do i care about and that's when they start to get into what the religions of the world have always been conversing about uh here we go and and to me that's where um this is exactly the point that that peterson moves now in terms of going from nichi to young because the question is here well how how can we account then for any reason to study the bible because that's really the question why bother why do this at all and peterson says well i've got my personal reasons but i want to talk about this because in a sense peterson says hey i'm well fed i've arrived at my career now i want to know why the heck i'm here now now people have made the argument well that's just the brain being silly you've got way too much extra power so why think about it okay but but why do art and why have ambition and why have ideas that one thing is better than another thing and and so then when you come to the bible you say well well why should we read this one book and not other books and i would say well read all the books you can but but what about this book should warrant our attention and so now peterson is going to in a sense reject the implicit embrace of nichi that brett weinstein and sam harris make in terms of trying to develop their own values and turn and say we have already a platform of values that we should continue and i'm not going to to stand on is a little too uncritical but i would say work and and in fact i've been going through the book of ezekiel right now in my adult sunday school class you can find all of that is on youtube if you're if you're interested in watching but but if you read the bible one of the things that you see is that the bible doesn't just sit there as as peterson shows the bible is hyperlinked and so the the new testament is always working on the old testament and i was just studying ezekiel 18 last for the last two weeks of my adult sunday school class and it begins with the question really engaging an idea that's right there in the ten commandments and it's working it over is it true that god punishes the children for the sins of the fathers is that true well well ezekiel 18 takes on that idea but then adds to it and so what brett weinstein said which i think was quite right we shouldn't just uncritically take what we've been given because i think actually uncritically we don't make it ours and so we should in fact critically engage it and work on it so let's let's take a look at where peterson transitions from nichi to young so i think it's very important that we sort out this problem um i think that i think that there isn't anything more important that needs to be done than that i've thought that for a long long time probably since the early 80s when i started looking at the psych the role that belief systems played in regulating psychological and social health because you can tell that they do that because of how upset people get if you challenge their belief systems it's like why the hell do they care exactly what difference does it make if and and this i i love this point because because peterson again if you if you look at his maps of meaning he alludes to it here in this course that that in the 1980s and i'm a contemporary peterson i'm about his saying about the same age he is yeah the 80s why did the world almost blow itself up for what and and i think in many ways you have to ask sam harris and brett weinstein why do you care so much if if africans um are are still killing each other over the evil eye now i agree that they care and i care too and i like that they care but but i think they have a more difficult time answering that question why should you care and that that gets into the question that peterson often gets into when he talks about the the killers at columbine and others that that there's a we're invested in this for good reason if all of your ideological axioms are 100 correct like people get unbelievably upset when you when you poke them in the axioms so to speak and it isn't it is not by any stretch of the imagination obvious why you know but there's some it's like there's a fundamental truth that they're standing on it's it's it's like they're on a raft in the middle of the ocean and you're starting to pull out the logs you know and they're afraid they're going to fall in and drown and and again this is an empirical this isn't peterson is this this is an empirically validated thing that you know for example if we look at what's what's been going on in the islamic world or you look at the hotbed in the middle east or you look at the culture war in the united states why are people so angry because what are we fighting about in in the united states where we're gloriously secure at least many of us and and why do we care so much to to fight this culture war what is going on and i think peterson is right that all of this stuff it matters to us we don't know why it matters we don't even know how it matters but it sure does matter and and for the same reasons that yeah we might not kill each other over the evil eye in the united states but you know we find our we find our neighbor either putting trump signs on the lawn or hillary signs on the lawn or bernie sanders signs on the lawn or flying a rainbow flag or flying a christian flag and people are upset they're ready to do stuff against each other why are we so connected to all of this non-material stuff why does the relational world matter so much it's like drowning what and what are the logs protecting themselves protecting them from and why are they so afraid to to move beyond the confines of the ideological system and these are not obvious things so i've been trying to puzzle that out for a very long time and i've done some lectures about that that are on youtube most of you know that and some of what i'm going to talk about in this series you'll have heard if you've listened to the youtube videos but you know i'm trying to hit it from different angles and so okay so niche's idea was that human beings were going to have to create their own values essentially now he understood that we had bodies and that we had motivations and emotions like he was a romantic thinker in some sense but way ahead of his time because he knew that our capacity to think wasn't some free-floating soul but was embedded in our physiology constrained by our emotions shaped by our motivation shaped by our body he understood that but he still believed that the only possible way out of the problem would be for human beings themselves to become something akin to god and to create their own values that was that's and he thought that the person okay now remember david brooks the road to character that human beings would have to create themselves as god this is again in a sense what ellen degenerous go to almost any commencement speaker and and any commencement address in the country at least in a secular form and you will hear something to the effect that you are right you are beautiful you are exactly who you are as you are now what's striking about this movement around peterson is that he is talking to people and saying you're not you're a mess now as a calvinist preacher i'm very used to that because if you look at tulip for example and i'm not going to get into all of that right now but total depravity we begin with the assumption that there's something deeply wrong with me and and almost the first principle of my religion is yes there is something wrong with me and and not only is there something wrong with me there's something wrong with me morally there's something wrong with me in terms of my character but again if you look at for example 12 step and remember that peterson himself worked in the area of of alcoholism and and rehab that that the first the first step in the 12 step program is to say i am out of control and i need another power to possess me i need another power to rescue me from myself now that's a long way from saying you're a god and so in a sense not only does nichi predict what happens in the soviet union or encourage what happens in nazi germany we can in fact in a sense see nichi in what's happening now in this movement since world war two in the united states where first we say i am godlike and the world must revolve around me and then we say well this aspect of my identity is foundational and therefore the world must revolve around it he talked about the person who could create their own values as the over man or the superman and that was one of the parts of nichian philosophy that the nazis i would say took out of context used to fuel their you know superior man ideology so and we know what happened with that that didn't seem to turn out very well that's for sure and see i also spent a lot of time reading carl young and it was through young and also john piaget who's developmental psychologist that i started to understand that our articulated systems of thought are embedded in something like a dream and that that dream is informed in a complex way by the way we act so you know we act out things we don't understand all the time and if that wasn't the case then we wouldn't need a psychology or a sociology or an anthropology or any of that because we would be completely transparent to ourselves and again as well read the apostle paul uh the good that i would do i do not do read augustin's confession talk about someone who is who's recognizing the layers to himself and someone who's who's painstakingly going through those layers when we when we realize we are we are not transparent we are not transparent to ourselves and again this is this is an aspect that you know almost any religious tradition will look at and and this is exactly the level that most religious traditions will sit you down and say you need to confront you because you don't know who you are and and you can't begin to deal with who you are and this entire world that you're living in and whatever bubble you're fabricating until you get in touch with who you are and what you are and then the questions will be well well well what am i and and this is in fact where peterson is going and we're clearly not so we're much more complicated than we understand which means that the way that we behave contains way more information than we know as a pastor i you know i one of the things i appreciate about peterson is that he's a clinician and as a pastor i i hear this stuff and i say oh yes it's so often the case that people say and you find this in in the press often they'll say well this this preacher is teaching this in church now as a preacher it's like you know i know how little talking at people gives or does how little changes them people often come up to me say you know pastor those people are doing wrong and you should tell them to stop it's like oh really um and do you think that will stop them and well maybe if you tell them it will and i think well i guess you've never watched me tell people to stop i could stand up and on church on sunday morning and say be good not bad and and it doesn't mean that people will stop people aren't like this we are enormously mysterious we are enormously complex we are enormously not in touch with ourselves and and and and those who don't know this about themselves are the most not in touch with themselves and and those who don't take this into account when they think about people well i i often just think well have you ever met a human being have you ever looked at one and watched one and paid attention to one because this is exactly what we're like and you can see this if you're a pastor if you're a school teacher if you're a social worker if you're a cop if you're a judge if you're a spouse if you're a parent if you're a child it should be obvious to any of us if we're paying attention and part of the dream that surrounds our articulated knowledge has been extracted as a consequence of us watching each other behave and telling stories about it for thousands and thousands and thousands of years extracting out patterns of behavior that characterize humanity and trying to represent them partly through imitation but also through drama and mythology and literature and art and all of that to represent what we're like so that we can understand what we're like and that process of understanding is what i see unfolding at least in part in the biblical stories and it's it's halting and partial and awkward and contradictory and and all of that which is one of the things that makes the book so complex but i see in it the struggle of humanity to arise to rise above its animal forebearers say and to become conscious of what it means to be human and that's a very difficult thing because we don't know who we are what we are where we came from or any of those things and you know the light life is an unbroken chain going back three and a half billion years it's an absolutely unbelievable thing every single one of your ancestors reproduced successfully for three and a half billion years it's absolutely unbelievable and we rose out of the dirt and the muck and here we are conscious but not knowing and we're trying to figure out who we are and a story that we've been telling or a set of stories that we've been telling for three thousand years seems to me to have something to offer and so when when i look at the stories in the bible i do i would say in some sense with the beginner's mind it's it's a mystery this book how the hell it was made why it was made why we preserved it how it happened to motivate an entire culture for two thousand years and to transform the world like what's going on how did that happen it's by no means obvious and one of the things that bothers me about casual critics of religion is that they don't take the phenomena seriously and it's a serious phenomena i mean um not at least because people have the capacity for religious experience and no one knows why that is and i mean you can induce it reliably in all sorts of different ways you can do it with brain stimulation you can certainly do it with drugs there's especially the psychedelic variety they produce intimations of the divine extraordinarily regularly people have been using drugs like that for god only knows how long 50 000 years maybe more than that to produce some sort of intimate union with the divine it's like we don't understand any of that when we discovered the psychedelics in the late 60s it shocked everybody so badly that they were instantly made illegal and abandoned in terms of research for like 50 years and it's no wonder because who the hell expected that nobody now now young was a student of niches you see and he was also i would say at a very astute critic of niches he was educated by freud and freud freud i suppose in some sense started to collate collate the information that we had pertaining to the notion that people lived inside a dream you know it was freud who really popularized the idea of the unconscious mind and we take this for granted to such a degree today that we don't understand how revolutionary the idea was like with what's happened with freud is that we've taken all the marrow out of his bones so to speak and left the husk behind and you know now when we think about freud we just think about the husk because that's everything that's been discarded but so much of what he discovered is part of our popular conception now including the idea that your perceptions and your actions and your thoughts are all what would you say informed and and shaped by unconscious motivations that are not part of your voluntary control and that's a very very strange thing it's one of the most unsettling things about the psychoanalytic theories because the psychoanalytic theories are something like you're a loose collection of living sub-personalities each with its own set of motivations and perceptions and emotions and rationales all of that and you have limited control over that so you're like a plurality of of of internal personalities that's loosely linked into a unity you know that because you can't control yourself very well which is one of Jung's objections to Nietzsche's idea that we could create our own values so Jung didn't believe that especially not after interacting with freud because he saw that human beings were affected by things that were deeply deeply affected by things that were beyond their conscious control and no one really knows how to conceptualize those things you know the cognitive psychologists think about them in some sense as computational machines and the ancient people i think thought of them as gods although it's more complex than that like rage would be a god mars the god of rage that's the thing that possesses you when you're angry you know it has a viewpoint and it it says what it wants to say and that might have very little to do with what you want to say when you're being sensible and it doesn't just inhabit you it inhabits everyone and it lives forever and it even inhabits animals and so it's this transcendent psychological entity that inhabits the the body politic like like a thought inhabits the brain that's one way of thinking about it it's a very strange way of thinking but it certainly it certainly has its merits i think that's a good place to stop for now these videos get long i won't play too much more but but i before a few years ago i came across jonathan hate's work and was very much gripped by it and and hate too is is hate doesn't profess any any christian belief at all but if if you if you read his first book and it's i think it's i think it's quite a helpful book i i found i found it quite helpful when he when he set up at least our anthropology as something like a an elephant and a rider the mind is divided into parts that sometimes conflict like a rider on the back of an elephant the conscious reasoning part of the mind has only limited control of what the elephant does nowadays we know the causes of these divisions in a few ways to help the rider and the elephant work better as a team and and but hate begins the book with the divided self and and we'll talk about how we are in fact divided and he has a quote from the book of galatians he has a quote from um you you look at roman's chapter seven and and we are terribly conflicted and and we don't know what we're doing and so i i found hate's idea of a rider and an elephant you know that that rider is severely outmatched by that elephant and and the elephant is this in a sense this this unconscious self and and every time i have i have a number of children and every time i would teach my child to to drive i would i would tell them i would tell them about the rider and well actually only my last one's got it because i read the book too late in the process but but i would tell them about the rider and the elephant and it's not unlike riding a bike or driving a car where in effect you learn to drive a car by taking what at the beginning is a tremendously conscious thing and teaching your unconscious brain to process it and and and that's a good deal of what we do we do it with math we do it when we learn an instrument you know you will you will mess up your free throws when you play basketball if you sit there and you think about it well oh why is that and and why is it that as the apostle paul says in romans chapter seven the good i would do i don't do and the evil i don't want to do i do who can save me and and and this is the human condition and and hate goes back and looks at a whole number of of examples from philosophy and different religions to try to just simply highlight this point that we're disconnected now now i think following hate um and here's another low representation drawing of me in a sense what we are are we are these these selves and i've really appreciated peterson's articulation that there are these oh shoot no i can't remember we you know we're a plurality loosely linked into a unity we have these these selves inside of us and and some of our some of our language has has gotten into this but but we're a jumble of those if you watch the movie inside out you've got all those little cartoon characters at the control rooms and you've got rage and you've got all these different emotions and they're they're trying to make the whole thing work and they're they're working as a committee but but as a pastor i see this all the time with people and and i see this with as myself and so now now the idea from young is that you know all these selves are watching and and we know way more than than we know right now in in terms of our conscious brain our unconscious self is in fact enormous and and only loosely connected with it and we might get insights you know when we dream or we have this experientially where we're we're sitting around and boom an idea pops into my head and that is in fact the strangest idea that an idea would pop into my head well where does that idea come from now now again when you when you get into questions of religion you get into a lot of things one of my favorite movies is is steve martin's leap of faith and and i love the scene where he he goes up to this cross and says why did you make so many suckers and and as a pastor i know plenty of charlatan pastors i know i know plenty of people who whether sincerely or or or whether duplicitously are you know so often simply manipulating people and and and people are in fact so easy to manipulate and and so i you know i come from a tradition that is that is um that i think is fairly balanced in this on one hand i was i was reading a story from a friend of mine who who was writing about the fact that his his wife's grandfather was dying and um and the family was around and they were keeping vigil he wasn't in the room in fact he was someplace else and he was you know some of his favorite hymns were going off in his head and then suddenly into his head pops a rather obscure dutch hymn now i'm from the christian reform church a lot of dutch reformed people um a rather obscure dutch hymn that was translated into english and that just just filled his mind and and later he finds out and talking he shares the story with his wife and finds out well that's just exactly the time that that her grandfather passed now again could that be coincidence absolutely but but what does it mean that it popped into his head and as a pastor i talk to people all the time who um i hear stories like this a lot so on one hand i say well i don't want to make too much of this because i also have people all the time saying well god told me this and i think well maybe he did or maybe he didn't um i suppose if god really wants to say it he can tell me but at the same time things happen that are just mysterious um read craig keener's book on miracles um he goes he goes into that deeply and c.s lewis doesn't go into this much but um craig keener's book on miracles a massive study on miracles which is story after story after story after story of of things that are simply difficult to explain and and so then you have to you have to ask yourself well what is going on and now this this idea of this great cloud inside of us you know makes good sense um but it doesn't it actually doesn't necessarily explain anything but it helps at least understand our experience but now then you get into the question and and actually i've got a lot of thoughts about this and so in some ways these are my prolegomena because the real the real issues that especially many who are engaging with jordan peterson are going to come down and say well well what about the bible and and so where jordan peterson is going to go is that that we have this dream-like state and it's it's in a dream is kind of the best word for it and i think that itself is an example of we can't articulate exactly what we're talking about but it's it's from there generations after generations that these stories emerge and there's an evolutionary process with these stories and and and then these are the stories and you can point to fairy tales and other religious traditions and and and these are the stories that emerge from our dream-like state and we don't know how they work we don't know why they work just like we don't know why music works we really don't but but we know it does work and we know that it's here and so therefore we should honor it but christians have this story of divine revelation that that the whole idea of revelation is that god reveals now now one of the things that i that i often try to point out with people that is at least in my tradition and i think in many of the best established christian traditions we believe that i got bibles over we got bibles everywhere we believe that the bible is inspired by god but it is organic inspiration and what that means is is not that and and i find i find certain groups of christians don't know this certain certain religious traditions believe in what they call mechanical inspiration the latter-day saints and joseph smith and the golden tablets and the seeing stones you know this is god transcribes and so then you have the problem of well does god make grammatical errors or or i i think the the the muslims with the quran have some similar ideas but in the christian tradition it's it's organic inspiration which means that god doesn't just you know put someone into a trance and they start writing but but but god is moving through the normal processes of history and and and then you say well well how can he move through that now the fun that's a funny question to ask because no ancient would ask it yet yet we're going to have to engage this question at some point between and and i think this is really some of the the real interesting things that you would want to engage peterson in in terms of okay well we've got this entire tradition of christian practice where we bow our heads and we either talk in our head or we speak out loud we pray as if we're talking to another human being well what's that about and and we look up in the sky and and what's that about and heaven is up and hell is down and the earth is here and and and what's that about so so and and how should someone who is listening to peterson who might say might begin from a presuppositional place to say well i i believe in in evolution well okay well here in a sense what peterson is giving you is a evolutionary argument to take the bible seriously and in other speeches in other places peterson will say act as if it is true now that's that's really interesting to me and i i'm you know i'm going to continue to play with that idea but but even this whole idea of okay well how do we regard the bible and for a long time i've wondered about the idea that well i see people over here who in fact their biblical stories about their people over here who don't believe any of it but actually do good people over here who say they believe it and they're they're morally outrageous now c.s lewis talks about that in mere christianity and i think he gives some good arguments but this whole business the part of what's really intriguing me about peterson is okay well let's unpack this so so jordan peterson in a sense is establishing a foundation for people who look at evolution to say yeah it's just obvious look at our dna look at the natural world of course evolution is true but in a sense undoing darwin and saying because evolution is true and because darwin is right therefore you should take the bible seriously so of course people like brett weinstein and sam harris are going to say wait a minute we thought we exercised this demon and peterson says no this is exactly why we should listen to this book then you've got a bunch of christians over here who perhaps are anti-evolution and they're going to say well that's just wrong you should just believe the bible is the word of god but peterson quite rightly asks well what do you mean by the word of god and and i've found for a long time um part of what i do in my sunday school classes someone will come into my sunday school quiet wonderful christian quite innocently just flop down a pat christian answer to a question and i will just ask them one more question and they're out of their depths what does it mean the bible is the word of god that's not an easy thing to answer and so when peterson says what does it mean to believe well that's that's actually a very good question and in fact what we do at least what we do in my church um and what i want to see done in church is that we wrestle with these questions because to just stand up and say i believe the bible is the word of god i believe in jesus as my savior if you if you confess with your lips and believe in your heart and sometimes i will i will stop people and say well confess with your lips i understand what that means what do you mean i believe in your heart if the bible is supposed to be um accurate in terms of geology shouldn't it also be accurate in terms of autonomy and well there's nerves down there but it doesn't say nerves it's you know this is enormously complex and so i think as christians at least for myself we ought to engage in these questions and so i find peterson tremendously fun to engage with well you just i just got lost in a rant and now i'm getting sidetracked so organic inspiration that god moves in history god moves in hosanna's life and god moves in paul's life and god moves in isaiah's life and and and and this is what emerges from it and the truth is as as peterson rightly says the vast majority of the bible is written by we don't know who oh we have ideas maybe people at this time and maybe people in this role and people with these resources but most of the bible is is anonymously written and and we simply don't know with the exception of paul and if you look at some really interesting things by gary habermass and the resurrection there's there's some interesting it's very curious that we know so much about paul and first corinthians 15 but i won't go there i too often go down rabbit trails so so you have then brett weinstein saying okay i can understand this there's that that there's an evolution of communities and and in a sense the group with the best story wins but but what you wind up with then is is in a sense the the the problem of pragmatism darwin and truth and and and that in a sense that you can say well well if what these stories are giving a community is an evolutionary advantage to prevail over their other community and you know actually this was this was worked out fairly selectively in the united states during the cold war that in a sense part of the reason church attendance reached its peak in the cold war in the united states was that we believed god was an asset in fighting communism not just in terms of our prayers but but and someone may could make an evolutionary argument and say we prevailed over the soviet union because of god others might say we prevailed over the soviet union because of the marketplace the difficulty you face with an argument like that is that there are so many counter examples that before the rise of of of nazism germany was about the most christian country you could find in the world why did it cave so easily to to to nazi paganism so you you've got this argument that basically says well we can't really know the truth but the closer we are to the truth the better we will adapt the better we will compete and so therefore we're always approximating the truth now i would i would recommend two books again c.s lewis's miracles which again i think is is just a an immensely helpful book but also alvin plantinga i mentioned him in my previous video where the conflict really lies where where you have to ask yourself the question that can darwin and pragmatism get us close enough to the truth and and in some sense that's that's in a sense the challenge behind peterson because well we don't know do we i was listening to one youtube where when one astrophysicist was was talking about the fact that you know are there are there life in other planets it might have been a veritas forum video are there life in other planets and he says well we've gotten to this point we haven't killed each other yet well that's good um but what other challenges lie ahead and obviously in terms of a christian narrative there's a there's a controlling narrative that that offers emotional hope on one sense but that you embrace that says well you know we ought to be um we we actually have hope in the future but but both plantica and lewis very much engage the question of but if can we really know truth if all we've been adapted to do is compete and and and one of the interesting groups i you know and i was thinking about this was you know the story of the jews since the jewish stories outlasted the babalones you know everybody know who knows who yawai is and the bible and only in the 19th century did we dig up gilgamesh um you know shouldn't you say that the jews should be out competing and now on one hand they are because they're still around and you know we're not no longer looking at the hit tites or the babalones in the same way even though saddam hussein tried to tried to resurrect it in a sense these stories prevailed over other stories and you could look at you could look at history perhaps as competition between stories and and in some ways throughout the whole medieval period it was the the islamic world versus the christian world at least in in the the parts of the former roman empire and now you've got christianity growing in africa and asia and china well is is history finally the story of of competing stories well well again the jews are a funny example because um on one hand were their stories better nebuchadnezzar came and destroyed jerusalem and it's at about that time that we think actually a lot of the stuff got written down so so who won that war really was it nebuchadnezzar or was it the jews and and so you have the story of the jews which are you know look at a people who you know have have basically had the world against them but they've been so doggedly determined to preserve their culture it's it's actually one of the most remarkable stories about humanity and and so but their story gets popularized not so much by let's say you know in the first century there's a split in judaism basically between the rabbinic tradition which is one approach to the old testament and christianity which is another approach to the old testament and as for example if you read and and t writes so if you if you really want to read something fat you can read nt writes the resurrection of the son of god where he basically says the existence of christianity is the best argument for the historicity of the of the resurrection that we have so history is this crazy thing and and and again um and the grand miracle which is probably the best chapter in this book where louis basically says we we imagine such a democratic approach to reality when nothing in evolution or in history is it all democratic um it's history is this crazy crazy thing and and so here perhaps you know if if i'm going to play with brett weinstein and sam harris perhaps it's not really our genes that are competing for history perhaps it is in fact our stories that are competing for history so um culture and belief so here we are and and and everyone walks around and thinking well sociology of knowledge works on everybody else but me and and then but but that basically assumes that i am a buffered self and this is again this is american culture and charles taylor has this idea and this is part of his his argument from 1500 to now why so few people believe in god and believe in god as compared to 500 years ago well we believe that we are a buffered self but now when you look at peterson and young you begin to see that parts of me are watching everything all the time i'm not that buffered and you know study after study of all kinds of weird psychological things come out to realize we're being impacted by all sorts of things the book 1493 you know the these malarial mosquitoes get in and and so why why did african slavery you know get strong in this one in this one area of the united states and not another why in the southern united states why in brazil and not argentina why not in massachusetts and why in virginia and then this particular author goes and says well you know mosquitoes and i think yeah that makes a lot of sense so i am not nearly as buffered from anything so why should i imagine i am buffered from god if a god exists so so can materialists finally found and this i think is always the big question can they finally find a foundation for their ought why must i embrace your value system why must i embrace any value system just so you can regard me as a good person and again so you've got sociology of knowledge working we are we are hardly buffered in just about any way and and again what one of the things that i appreciate about this is that we know more than we know we know and and so this this idea and that i think is that i think is is quite true that that we we are far more complex than we know we act out and we do things we don't realize that we know we're doing so how can we account for this and then peterson turns and says if you just look on the face of it you'd better read this book or at least come to terms with it if you if you actually want to have any clue about how we got here well that's that's what i got for now i'm not entirely happy with how it ended but that's the way it goes i if if i'm going to have time to do these things that's going to have to be first drafts so i just looked at comments today and i was you know i i'm a pastor of a tiny little church in sacramento california and i am not an important person in in almost any respect but i i'm just surprised that anybody listens to this but then again i'm a lot of people ask say to me i'm surprised you listen to jordan peterson videos but i find that there are tens or tens of thousands of people out there doing this which i guess is the miracle of the internet if i may use this word so so thank you for watching and thank you for indulging me and you know yeah leave a comment and um again i you know why do i bother doing this well i i do this because you know and again when i when i look at peterson because parts of me that are behind me are you know prompting me to do this is that god is that some you know leftover stuff from my father is that you know why i have no idea but i do it and here it is and if you find it helpful i'm a happy man if you don't find it helpful it's good enough for me doing it myself so thanks for watching leave a comment subscribe i hope it's worthwhile
