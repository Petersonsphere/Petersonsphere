 Hi, this is Paul. I just watched a video debunking Jordan Peterson now and I thought I'd make a response video saying why Jordan Peterson had to reintroduce God in scare quotes to save science. Now, I like a good debunking and I wish I had a cool British accent and I actually enjoyed this video a lot. I had a lot of fun with it. One of the things that I picked up right away was realism and I always have a little bit of trouble with realism because especially how it's used in this video it's kind of like truthism or what I believe-ism or not what some other idiot believes-ism because real is kind of grabbing the verbal high ground around this word and in fact there's lots of different realisms that even Wikipedia notes. Platonic realism, medieval realism, Scottish common sense realism, naive realism, scientific realism, realism in physics, aesthetic realism, lots of realisms and if there's more than one realism can we really have a realism? But anyway, back to the video. Jordan Peterson has a funny and not funny haha but funny strange idea of truth and I thought the video did a nice job of using Transliminal 2015 which I think is probably on YouTube the clearest articulation of these beliefs of Jordan Peterson that I've been working on and processing over a number of my videos. Now one of the things that I think this video does well and unintentionally is that it exposes which in Greek to expose or to reveal is the word apocalypse and some of you who know something about apocalypse also know that expose, reveal is connected with the book of Revelation and that's going to come up a little bit later in our video. So one idea of truth and I think what this video really does nicely a job of is exposing how objective or realism our common idea of truth is while saying that Jordan Peterson's idea of truth is pragmatic and therefore doesn't work and this is what gets, this is what Jordan Peterson gets into when he talks to Sam Harris and so maybe actually what this video is doing is exposing or being a little apocalyptic on our assumptions of the objective but I couldn't find the guy's name so I don't mean this with any disrespect but Mr. Rational, his main argument in the video basically is Bret Weinstein, I hope I'm saying that name right, Bret Weinstein's argument in that conversation he had with Jordan Peterson and Jonathan Pageau where he says what makes the scientific truth hierarchically superior is that it explains all the subordinate truths in a way that is logically consistent. I think this is a really good argument and I like the way it's said and I in fact want to use this argument throughout this video to ask if Mr. Rational's ideas are quite so clear-cut as he presents them to be and if Jordan Peterson's ideas are quite so easily debunked so let's continue and if you remember my video about that I did a little bit last week on C.S. Lewis and we're going to get into C.S. Lewis again in this video. This is kind of the materialist perspective that Jordan Peterson treats in Transliminal 2015 that materialists are Newtonians because they see objects and why they're Newtonian is that the world is full of objects and kind of like Newtonian mechanics that works on billiard balls, well there's atoms and they're little solid objects and the world is built with these atoms and we can do all kinds of things with these atoms and there we are. This is obviously pre-quantum and in one of the videos I have to do a little something in quantum because that matters because a lot of I didn't understand what quantum was until I learned how it's used and why it got used in terms of very very tiny particles and theory and all of this stuff so Newtonians the world is full of objects these objects are real if and we're going to talk about trees falling in the woods and so Peterson says ah these materialists they're seeing objects and he comes along and says aha being is much more complicated than that because story governs stuff that was basically Jonathan Peugeot's argument in the video where he's talking with Jonathan Peterson and Brett Weinstein and Jordan Peterson keeps saying we see tools and after Jordan Peterson said that I said dog got it he's right we do see tools because when I walk into a mall I eyes focus on all of the things that I'm motivated to see not necessarily all the things are in the room because I can't see all the things are in the room so in other words I'm following Augustine and those of you who want to look at some reworking of Augustine in a contemporary frame can look at James K. Smith because that's basically what he's doing you are what you love and and in these liturgies of worship and all these kind of things we see tools we don't see objects there's too many objects to see so what we really so we filter the objects and we see tools and then there's also these hierarchies that we're dealing with we're kicking out dominance we're competence hierarchies and all these other hierarchies so that's what Jordan Peterson says and um I think he's right stuff story governs stuff and we built hydrogen bombs why we didn't walk through the forest and say oh look a hydrogen bomb like a fallen tree no we built hydrogen bombs why did we build hydrogen bombs do we know everything again watch Transliminal 2015 for this we didn't build tiger bombs now I thought you know the problem with hydrogen bombs is that after you explode them they destroy the cities and they leave radioactive contaminations and they do all this stuff if you really want to get rid of the people well remember some of you might remember back in the 80s what was it the neutron bomb that was supposed to kill all the peeps and keep all the stuff well well I'm thinking we should use tiger bombs because I think tigers are cool and tigers are endangered but you know if we put the kind of money that we put into figuring out nuclear weapons into breeding tigers I'm sure we could breed lots of them and then maybe what we should do is parachute tigers on our enemies and flood the lands with tigers and the tigers would go around and they kill all the the people and they kill the dogs and the cats and you know tiger bombs what's wrong with tiger bombs well what story is governing this well the story that we want we have enemies and we want to kill other people and so that's why we develop hydrogen bombs well stuff exists because there are stories behind it that's why we make stuff colt Tolkien calls us sub-creators and this is what we done in fact Mr. Rationality created his the rationality channel and on his Facebook page he says rationality rules is predominantly a YouTube channel dedicated to debunking the religious and supernatural and again I like a good debunking now and then when you have too much bunk around it's good to debunk and get the bunk out of there but apparently Mr. Rationality feels that religion and the supernatural now we're you know got to be knocking on the door of C.S. Lewis and his book miracles here the supernatural needs to be debunked in other words it isn't real now do we have a motive for this perhaps well of course we have a motive you you can't be human and think and not have motives right or are you going to make that argument why do motives qualify truth claims so we all feel this well you're just you're just attacking Mr. Rationality because you're a pastor and if Mr. Rationality wins pastors lose and then I'll have to get a job being a fireman or a dump truck driver or who knows or maybe I'm just old enough to get on social security pretty soon so why does the needing to be debunked religious and supernatural exist anyway where did this come from well fortunately Freud gave us the answer to that life is scary because people die and we are afraid of death and so people make up stories to cope with the fear notice that we just made up a story to account for the religious and supernatural and notice also that once we have a story to account for it then somewhere in the back of our minds we imagine well then we should be able to dismiss it okay but there's a story and a motive to account for everything we make and that doesn't mean those things aren't real that doesn't mean those things don't exist so and when then we might ask the question why do we keep making up stories well but here we are back in Jordan Peterson's frame and saying well you know this is exactly Peterson's point you've got all of this stuff and so you can't imagine truth without story you can't imagine truth without seeing that we see tools and you can't imagine truth without these hierarchies and in fact Mr. Rationality probably won't make a video about this video he might think that this video isn't good enough or probably he doesn't think um you know really make worth making a video about because making a video about me won't get him extra views oh there's motivation um he might leave a comment which would be fine if he did i'd love to sit down and do a video with Mr. Rational that would be fun um but Rationality Rules has 35,000 subs and i've only got 4,000 subs and in the YouTube universe he is up the hierarchy for me now it's interesting that he also picked on Jordan Peterson who is up the hierarchy from him so in other words the hierarchy is looming in our little universe and motivations are lurking and do we really pay any attention to all of this yes we do why we think this is real so what does realism really mean what do you really mean by real um it's a funny word real and in fact if you look at Rationality Rules um i can learn some things about what is ruling rationality in this case and it seems to be some sort of hierarchy and i'll notice that his um is Jordan Peterson debunking video is is shooting up fast um that's good and i've done the same thing in my channel talking about Jordan Peterson talked about um you know gave me 4,000 subscribers when it was just the Freddy and Paul show we had 15 and um is the is is are my talks about Jordan Peterson more important than than my um than my that's probably Freddy calling right now because we did a show this morning and i'm going to post it and he's going to call me every 10 minutes until i post it now you have a little window into what life as a pastor is like i don't even have to look at the phone and know that that's Freddy and i was too stupid to un i was too stupid to not unplug the phone before starting this video but here's Mr Rationality and i think he's doing something very rational something very human in fact this is completely rational if Mr Rationality is motivated to put his message out there and i think Mr Rationality is very real and i think Mr Rationality's motivations are very real and i think they're fine he is playing this game just like the rest of us and it's a real game tree bark roots or not so why make a channel about people's false beliefs well now this is going to get kind of interesting because we say well people's beliefs don't hurt anyone sticks and stones can break my bones but words will never hurt me which has never been true because actually we we are afraid of beliefs when lots of people believe them and that's where we have you know religion and superstition and the supernatural and we're bothered by all these people who believe in these things because all of these people have clout or maybe just a few people who believe in them have power so for example if if someone sitting at a nuclear button thinks the world would be better without another country and presses the button well that's a belief to contend with and so yeah well how real are beliefs are beliefs like that tree that will fall in the forest that we're about to hear about is that what qualifies something to be real well how does science work because that's what we want to talk about we want to talk about science because you know science seems to be the way we know things well how does science work well as peterson mentions in transliminal 2015 we first strip out the subjective and we do that on purpose now paul vanderkley might believe in tiger bombs paul vanderkley might believe that the um that india lacking nuclear no actually they do have nuclear weapons well maybe india has decided that in addition to nuclear weapons they are going to breed tigers and they're going to launch tigers on their enemies but paul vanderkley is the only one to believe in tiger bombs and is motivated to do so and he's motivated because he wishes to climb a hierarchy by making a funny little story with pretty little tigers and and maybe someone will make a meme out of my pretty little tiger bombs but therefore it's unlikely that it's likely that tiger bombs do not exist but do we know that tiger bombs don't exist well we can't really say we know that but we're we're we're let's say it this way we're sure enough we're sure enough that tiger bombs don't exist that the united states is not making preparations to to thwart an imminent tiger bomb attack from the the government of india and i think it's very reasonable to imagine that we don't believe in tiger bombs because paul has made up this cute little story he has motive and he's made a video to pick on a bigger fish mr rationality and he's made up a story with it but again dog on it we're still dealing with jordan peterson's funny definition of truth and even his funny definition of real well let's talk a little bit more science we care about false beliefs because they impact our politics because in fact we have democracies and all of these people running around with false beliefs whether they be christian beliefs or new age beliefs or or beliefs in scientism let's be fair to both sides um they vote and they impact policy and so for example the great climate change debate i personally believe that all of these cars are pumping lots of co2 into the atmosphere and i personally believe that the the co2 in the atmosphere is going to have an effect on our environment that is going to have an effect on the oceans and we will not like this effect i believe that but there's a lot of people out there and some of you who watch my videos i know because you've made comments to this effect who don't believe this therefore what we really want to do is really did i just say real again what we really want to do is talk about what's real and it's very real that lots of people have lots of ideas and those people vote and therefore well listen to richard dawkins i'll put the link in his he appeared on unbelievable which is a christian show and i mentioned this in a commentary on jordan peterson biblical series three one of those videos um and here richard dawkins who is this notorious four horsemen of the of the of the atheists he comes along i think it was was it alvin planninger that made we'll talk about alvin planning a little bit later so richard dawkins is talking to a jewish scholar and an evangelical scholar and they're having a lovely conversation on this program and richard dawkins basically says yeah but you're not the kind of christians i'm trying to debunk with my book it's those kind of christians that vote against evolution being taught in schools and those kind of christians that don't believe in heating up that we're heating up the environment it's those people's ideas i want to counter so therefore i'm going to write a book and develop all of this science and popularize this i've spiced i can so that these people will stop believing it then we'll all come together but what is real in this um i think co2 in the atmosphere is real i think e co2 leaching into the ocean is real i think the the climate heating up is real i may not be able to um convince you of that i may be wrong in my ideas but that's that's my realism baby and so all of these false beliefs impact lives now what are we going to do with all these false believers now we don't want to kill them because of their false beliefs and we like to think that we've grown beyond that because after all um john calvin's geneva killed servetus which someone will usually bring up if i bring up calvinism or um catholics burn people at the stake or buddhist monks who we think must all be nice guys and me and mar are kicking out muslim the muslims that we think all must be hateful guys and we we we don't want to kill people over beliefs anymore but what are we going to do with all these people who believe wrong things well isn't this why jordan peterson wrote maps of meaning wasn't he anxious as a young man about the cold war and asked himself why are these two civilizations try to kill each other isn't this the question that launched this whole business it'd be nice if he could answer that well why is sam harris an ally with jordan peterson sometimes and sometimes a rival well it's because they both believe in science now let's like take a look at what i think again is is a really good statement by brett weinstein what makes the scientific truth hierarchically superior is that it explains all the subordinate truths in a way that is logically consistent in other words jordan peterson so far in his idea of his funny idea of truth which is not like the assumed idea of truth that most of us are running around with well what where did we get this idea probably through a lot of videos like this realism one that says oh but real things are like trees and i would say yeah but real things are like ideas because i don't think if if richard dawkins didn't think the ideas in people's heads about global climate change or evolution or creationism weren't real he wouldn't be writing about it they're real enough to motivate richard dawkins they're real enough to motivate sam harris and they're real enough to motivate mr rationality to make videos that's pretty doggone real they're real enough to make people act oh yeah pragmatism what does peterson keep saying it's it's what people really believe oh there we use that word again what i can i say this sentence without what people really believe is what they act on so we're still left with jordan peterson's truth ah but let's talk about the betrayal and the dead wife argument and it's a this is a fun argument well fun adultery and suicide but basically the argument is this let's how do you know your wife's not cheating on you and let's be let's be gender fair and swap it around how do you know how does a wife know her husband isn't cheating on her maybe he's a scumbag maybe she's never found that little text in his phone maybe you know she doesn't know and so but it's real enough for her to act and she kills herself okay well it was real enough for her to act was it true well what if he never did the dirty with another woman or another man let's be you know politically correct here um broke back analogy what if what if how can she know well let's take a look at mr realism's argument here because this is where he kind of comes to the climax of his video and uh see what he says true that she was having an affair that move is not open to you and yet you're acting like it is now in my opinion this application of the reductio ad absurdum technique annihilates peterson's assertion it's simple if one was to commit suicide because their partner was cheating on them the act of suicide wouldn't make their partners cheating on them untrue in the realist sense sure it would make it untrue in the peterson sense but it wouldn't in the realist period if a tree falls and nobody hears it it still makes a sound it still omits vibrations now with peterson okay let's pause there now let's talk about the tree so tree falls this is realism okay his brand of realism he hasn't defined it but i think we kind of know what he means his brand of realism is a tree falls in the forest does it make a sound if nobody's there to hear it it still makes a sound well how do we know that well you see you see evidence that the tree fell you're walking along in this in this dark forest that nobody ever goes to anymore and you find a fallen tree and you can say when this tree fell it made a sound and i think that's very reasonable and you know by experience and science that falling trees make sound in space with air now we might say that a falling a tree falling in a vacuum makes no noise but because trees don't grow in vacuums trees that fall make noise but let's pause and slow down our thinking i'm reading alan jacob's new book how to think i'm in chapter one so far i'm really enjoying it what have we done here we have inferred that when this tree fell it made a sound even if no one heard it now that's not a bad inference that's a good inference but it is in fact an inference and you also accept and let's you know let's be fair here because i don't know how many of us have heard trees fall a lot of you city dwellers haven't i've heard a few trees fall in my life i was sitting in my office here one day and i heard this enormous crash and i jumped up out of my chair and ran out to the street and here a tree had fallen over into the street i heard the tree fall i didn't see it fall i went out the tree had fallen and when i got outside i met someone who saw the tree fall i heard it but he heard it and saw it whoo now this whole line of inference however has had a whole lot of people connected with it in fact we also accept this testimony in this way through a chain of evidence through more people again now now let's look at the the realism article let's look at the realism argument here that okay this this woman this woman heard it or this man they they figured this out now where's it going to go next with this since definition of truth thoroughly addressed i want to ask a potent question why does peterson want to nest not only our perception of realist truth but realist truth itself within peterson truth is it perhaps possible that he has a motive is it possible he has a motive and and right here in a sense this he gives up the game with this argument it's like your video could have been a lot better if you hadn't brought motive into it because you know what we're back in peterson land why do people keep bunking up our science with their motives because we imagine that when the tree falls and it makes a sound there's no motive in that it's just real right but peterson has a motive all right peterson has a motive well mr rationality has a motive i have a motive sam harris has a motive richard dawkins has a motive richard dawkins lets christians on a christian radio program that's about apologetic slide when he figures out they're not arguing for christian science he has a motive now why do people keep bunking up our science with their motives well how did science come to be you know we didn't thought we didn't run into science like we run into this fallen tree we made science people made science well did people have motivations when they made science uh yeah motivated people made science well what were their motivations do the motivations of people who made science undermine the validity of science itself kind of like mr rationality says peterson's motive undermines peterson's point motives can undermine points but if any motive undermines every point then nothing humans do can ever be true nothing humans do can ever be true if that's the case because things are causing it see this is why we have to get into csl's book on miracles see mr rationality thinks it does or he wouldn't have mentioned it in the video now this is the dead wife betrayed her lying cheating husband knows it and the woman or man he slept with knows that he cheated on her and she killed herself and she killed herself and so therefore this is his argument even after she kills herself did he cheat with her well maybe and if you ask him maybe say yeah i slept with i slept with my neighbor's wife well there you go adultery just like it says in the ten commandments i slept with my neighbor's wife and we say aha see just be whether or not she believes it doesn't make a difference whether it's true or not true now the hydrogen bomb exists what if this poor woman kills herself after this woman kills herself a nuclear war happens and all human life is wiped out and let's suppose we're not the only life in the universe to keep the argument simple and don't have to go into enter into an interplanetary apocalypse or an interplanetary revelation as we would say translating apocalypse into english uh why are we using this word did the scumbag still cheat on his poor fragile wife even after the nuclear annihilation wiped out all human beings all people who had any concept of adultery or anything at all like that did it still happen now the realist would say of course it happened but how do we still know well who is left to know well by definition of my argument no one is left to know well then does it matter oh but now we're back into motivation what does it mean by did it still happen well you say yeah but we have this mental picture of the world and it's and it's kind of like a movie and so we saw him cheat with his neighbor's wife and we saw her she never had any evidence but she just couldn't trust his lion eyes and so she you know she went into the car and she you know put a garden hose in the tailpipe and closed up the garage and gassed herself to death and poof she's gone and he still cheated on her okay but does it matter what do you mean does it matter we saw the movie we saw the cheating we saw the gassing we saw the nuclear war but here's my question who's we this is the main argument what makes the scientific truth hierarchically superiors that explains all the subordinate truths in a way that is logically consistent the only way the story makes any sense is if after nuclear annihilation and everyone is gone we are still imagining it that's the only way this makes sense that someone still sees it and this is exactly the same problem with the elephant i'll get to the elephant in a minute see see why does peterson need god and i'm putting god in quotes because you know peterson isn't giving an argument for the existence of god but what peterson is saying about this kind of science is that you still need consciousness you still need an observer you still need someone to see it so that at the end of the story where the guy cheats the scumbag cheats on his wife she just can't trust his lion eyes even though she has no evidence she gases herself in the garage uh some mad man puts his finger on the nuclear button causes a chain reaction and all the nukes go off and the entire human race is destroyed and oops this was the only planet that had life in it and and then the the clock winds out in the universe and the universe goes away you can't tell the story without an observer there's inference in here peterson has found a need for god because the realist materialist naturalist needs a god or a viewer or an objective viewer and i would add a single objective viewer one who sees the truth one who sees the truth directly so are we talking naive realism are we talking scottish common sense realism which philosophical realism are you really talking about really such an observer verifies the always inference leap that every fallen tree makes a sound now here's the thing we say that well a tree has to make a sound because all those leaves pushing down on air and the hitting the ground we know by science this makes sounds well how do we know this by science well we have seen this happen and we have inferred that every time it happens because well then we start to categorize things well at least it it won't it won't happen in a vacuum but but every other time it will make a sound okay because we've seen this and well have we seen every time a tree has fallen has has a tree ever fallen that it hasn't made a sound now you can't know this now you say but it's reasonable to believe it i say yeah it is it's very reasonable but might there be that once a tree fell and it never made a sound you say no i can't believe that happens because it would break the rules of nature ah rationale rules we're into rules now too but here's where god comes in handy because god makes the convention work you see god is there to watch the scumbag cheat on his wife god is there to watch the woman who can't trust her husband's lion eyes gas herself in the garage god is there to watch the madman push the nuclear button god is there while we nuke each other all to death god is there to watch the dark destruction of the universe now what are we doing when we tell this story what stand where do we stand when we tell this story we sit in god's chair we are imagining which we commonly do and we do it all the time in fact we do it instinctively and naturally we are imagining that we are watching the truth we imagine that we are watching the real world and that this is the real story in fact we can't tell this story in any other way but to imagine it in fact you can't tell any other story in any other way than to imagine this this is why jordan peterson brings god into it and and i don't think peterson does this quite so clearly as hopefully i'm laying it out today probably not doing it as well so i'm going to bring us to someone else who actually does this far better than i do and far more compactly this is why you need god because you can't tell a story like this a story like we imagine we know about the dark cold end of the universe without sitting in a seat and imagine we're seeing it now this is exactly like the story of the elephant and the blind man and i always wanted to know why are those sick blind men filling up that innocent elephant you know that poor elephant he's not there for the gratification of these perverted blind men i probably shouldn't say things like this but why does the pluralist argument seem to underline undermine religious monarchy well what is monarchy monarchy mono one rk a little bit of greek would be helpful here rk ancient greek greek word with the primary sense is beginning origin or source of action in philosophical language the archaic period rk designates the source origin or root of the story of the cheating jerk the suicide of wife the madman on the nuclear button and nuclear annihilation is told from one point it's a monarchically told story now i'm really good at telling stories like this because i have a consciousness and my consciousness is thinking in the same direction and i can lay out this story for you and say well here's the story it's a monarchical story and the story of the blind man and the elephant and we say you see none of us can see the whole truth all of us can only see the piece of the elephant that we're feeling up all right but the story only works if you already see or know what an elephant is is if you want to hear versions of this read leslie new begin do i have this book right here i think where's where's leslie new begin's book um sorry see i'm a crappy video maker um read leslie new begin uh tim keller gets this from leslie new begin you can't tell this story without already knowing what an elephant is if you undermine and this is where this gets really interesting in terms of monotheism and a singular viewer if you undermine theistic monarchly you lose the elephant again and all you have are a bunch of blind men arguing about this thing that they're touching you have the same problem with theistic watchers so in other words when c.s lewis goes through his book miracles he says i'm going to presume i'm going to presume um i'm going to presume monotheism because in many ways polytheism isn't really the same thing you have all the same problems in polytheism that you have in democracy because none of the gods can see the whole truth and in fact science requires someone to see the whole truth science requires that we are all imagining there is a singular truth this is why science develops behind an entire culture that's been formed by what monotheism this is why science grows out of the abraham religions and not so much out of some of these other religious systems because science itself has embedded within it has it nested within itself this monarchical view of reality that says every time a tree falls it makes sound no matter what because you're imagining an objective viewer will stand there and say it now two people are sitting in my office and the tree falls outside my door i get up and rush to the door and say i heard the truth tree fall another person says i didn't hear that tree fall i don't think that tree fell at all maybe that's my neighbor maybe that's my neighbor saying there's no tree in the road i don't have to clean that up i don't have to pay if that tree fell on someone's car say aha you're motivated by a story you don't want to pay yeah and this was why we imagine a completely objective all-knowing viewer completely objective all-knowing viewer but that's just another word for god and this is what we have and this is why peterson has to reinvent god and he'll keep him in scare quotes in a sense and he'll be an agnostic about him because he can't demonstrate him within his pragmatic epistemology but you can't have science without some kind of monarchical singular viewer monarchical singular viewer to establish this real that you're talking about you lose objective science without god your god fills in every gap because of the inference leap you might say well what if a tree fell without making noise well we can't prove it never happened and this is the same issue we have with miracles the same issue you'll have with with ghosts the same issue you have with all kinds of things we can't explain but we use this monarchical all-knowing completely unbiased totally objective viewer that is imagined by science to assert all trees that fall make noise that's where we get the inferential leap you can't have science without this leap and you need god to make this leap now predictability gives your argument grip because every time we treat if if another tree on my property falls i will hear it i completely believe that i can believe that i believe that's completely rational but you can't run an experiment on all of known history you can't tell me that every tree has that has fallen has made noise without your inferential leap and you can't prove it without saying an objective all-knowing eternal viewer has seen it and speaks the truth nor can you see all known experience you're just one person so and and there's an awful lot of funny testimony out there now realists naturalists materialists we've got enough evidence via probability that such inferences always hold now you can't really say that you can say we've got enough evidence via probability that this is reasonable to believe i'll go with you there it's reasonable to leave but now read jordan peterson's book recommendation the metaphysical club about where probability arose and in the video that um um fell stillborn from the video camera um on chapter two of miracles and then i took some things from a guy explaining random numbers talked about probability probability was discovered or dare we say invented because we didn't discover tree that probability just like we discovered a fallen tree probability was discovered or invented in the 19th century by who the pragmatists because probability is good enough because it has worked for us so far now we're jumping into jordan peterson's pragmatism again why make it truly to make it truly universal you need what i will call the myth of inference c.s lewis addressed all of this none of this is new and in fact the question about inference and the question about knowledge and the question about epistemology has been around a while and and the reason i use c.s lewis you could use alvin plantiga because alvin plantiga runs through this in a far tighter philosophical sense but alvin planting is a lot harder to read than c.s lewis so i just use c.s lewis because he gets the point across so this is a portion of his of his essay called is theology poetry and he's basically picking up brett weinstein's argument about you know the porcupine that we see with the joe rogan jordan peterson video and the argument that he makes with jonathan pageau and jordan peterson on the set peterson and c.s lewis will pick this up and i'll say it much clearer than i will for all these reasons then i think though we though we knew even before freud that the heart is deceitful that those who accept theology are not necessarily being guided by taste rather than reason the picture so often painted of christians huddling together on an ever narrower strip of beach while the incoming tide of science mounts higher and higher correspondence to nothing in my own experience that grand myth which i asked you to admire a few minutes ago is not for me a hostile novelty breaking in on my traditional beliefs on the contrary that cosmology cosmology is what i started from if you look at c.s lewis's biography he gave up christianity and he embraced this cosmology he embraced this realism and bought it wholeheartedly and became an oxford don but as c.s lewis says if you want to keep this you'd better be a little selective about the books that you read because c.s lewis began to see enough to give it up deepening distrust and final abandonment of it preceded my conversion to christianity so now he's addressing actually their motivation long before i believed theology to be true i had already decided that the popular scientific picture it's a picture remember the picture of the cheating husband the suicidal wife the madman with his finger on the nuclear button the death of all complex consciousness in the universe and even the death of all consciousness in the cold dark end of the universe is for us a picture long before i believed in theology be true i'd already decided the popular scientific picture at any rate is false one absolutely central inconsistently consistency ruins it it is the one we touched on a fortnight ago this is from his socratic club the whole picture professes to depend on inferences from observed facts inference such as well when i see the tree fall and i know a little bit of something about sound waves and gravity and all of this they'll always make a sound that's the inference that says every tree will make a fall sound that falls well it's all reasonable inference the whole picture professes to depend on inferences from observed facts unless inference is valid the whole picture disappears unless we can be sure that reality in the remotest nebula or the remotest part obeys the thought laws of human scientists here and now in this laboratory in other words unless reason is an absolute it is in ruin this is where pete this is where louis is going to go in miracles human scientists here and now in this laboratory oops yeah those who ask me to believe this word picture also ask me to believe that reason is simply the unforeseen and unintended byproduct of mindless matter at one stage of its endless and aimless becoming what is that saying well there is no reason guiding ensuring that our faculty of inference is true and always trustworthy we say it's probably trustworthy it's trustworthy this is peterson's argument it's trustworthy enough for existence but we don't know if this will be trustworthy enough on longer periods of existence this is why peterson keeps talking about lobsters and great long periods of time because this little thing we're calling inference is in this worldview a product of chaos and imagined randomness now we're going to have to talk about randomness because that's not such a simple thing either i'll read it again yet those who ask me to believe the word picture also ask me to believe that reason is simply an un the unforeseen and unintended byproduct of mindless matter at one stage of its endless and aimless becoming here is the flat contradiction they ask me to in the same moment accept a conclusion and to discredit the only testimony on which that conclusion can be based the difficulty is to me a fatal one in other words how do you know it's true how do you know that inference this power of inference that we're doing is true we already know people use inference wrongly well the only way it works is if there is this objective observer who not only knows and sees the whole picture but always makes inference right and you've already taken him off the table this is why jordan peterson puts him back on the table and why it annoys the people who've been trying to keep him off the table the difficulty for me is a fatal one and the fact that when you put it to many scientists far from having an answer they seem to not even understand what the difficulty is and this has been my experience as well a difficulty is assures me that i've not found a mare's nest now this is a lovely old saying go ahead and google it find out what a mare's nest is it is exactly what you imagine a mare is a horse if you walk around and you see horses eggs well they're not horses eggs why well it's a it's a mare's nest well there's no such thing as a mare's nest and c.s lewis is saying well here's the point right they seem to not understand what the difficulty is assured me that i've not found a mare's nest but detected a radical disease um but detected a radical disease in their whole mode of thought from the very beginning the man who has once understood the situation is compelled henceforth to regard the scientific cosmology as being in principle a myth it's a story though no doubt a great and many true particulars have been worked out into it and no doubt a great this is why i try to use the audiobook a great many true particulars have been worked into it this is a myth this is a story we're back in the frames i was taught at school when i had done a sum to prove my answer the proof or verification of my the proof or verification of my christian answer to the cosmic sum is this when i accept theology i may find difficulties at this point or that in harmonizing it with some particular truths that are embedded in the myth in the mythical cosmology derived from science but i can get in or allow for science as a whole granted the reason granted that reason is prior to matter and the light of that primordial that primal reason illuminates finite minds this is essentially the much longer version of c.s lewis's book miracles i can understand how men should come by observation and inference to know a lot about the universe they live in trees that fall make sound i agree it's very reasonable but you know it by the myth of inference if on the other hand i swallow the scientific cosmology as a whole then not only can i not fit in christianity motive i cannot even fit in science if minds are holy if minds are wholly dependent on brains and brains on biochemistry and biochemistry in the long run on the meaningless flux of atoms i cannot understand how the thought of those minds should have any more significance maps of meaning should have any more significance than the sound of the wind in the trees and this is to me the final test this is how i distinguish dreaming from waking when i am awake i can in some degree account for my study my account and study my dream read you oh gosh he goes into a lot of dreams the dragon that pursues me last pursued me last night can be fitted into my waking world i know that there are such a such things as dreams i know that i had eaten an indigestible dinner i know that a man of my reading might be expected to dream of dragons tolkien is sitting there reading the hobbit to him but while in the nightmare i could not have fitted in my waking experience the waking world is judged more real because it thus contains the dreaming world the dreaming world is judged less real because it cannot contain the waking one this is this argument lewis is basically saying you can fit science into myth but you can't fit you know you can fit science into the bigger world science is the smaller world it relies on the bigger world it relies on the bigger story it relies on the objective monarchical unbiased viewer for the entire thing to work now ask the pragmatist we can't get there we can only get there via probability and every argument that debunks this is based on probability we say well we we can trust our inference is good enough because it seems to work and this is exactly where peterson goes in terms of his saying yeah but how long will it work we're only living 80 or 100 years and so it's human civilization is maybe only 10 000 years and we've had these stories for maybe a little longer than that but the lobster hierarchy has worked so that's more real than this other story see peterson's not disagreeing with this he's just saying yeah but you're skipping over a lot of these pieces and that's exactly what c.s lewis is saying and this is why lewis says i can't believe this brand of realism for the same reason i am certain that in passing from the scientific point of view to the theological i have passed from dreaming to waking christian theology can fit in science art morality and the sub christian religions the scientific point of view cannot fit in any of these things not even science itself why is mr rationality working hard to debunk the supernatural because he doesn't believe the supernatural is real supernatural cannot fit in his world if one supernatural thing happens you have to abandon mr rationality's world if one supernatural thing happens you don't have to abandon christianality christianity and you don't have to abandon science which gets back to chapter one of c.s lewis's book on miracles why begins with a ghost story the scientific point of view cannot fit in any of these things not even science itself i believe in christianity as i believe the sun has risen not because i see it but because by it i see everything else i've probably read this quote 20 times and it wasn't until after i watched mr rationality's video and walked through all of this stuff that i much more fully understood what lewis is saying here so i have to give mr rationality credit he really helped me and and that's why you know to me this is a fun game and i hold no ill will against mr rationality or his video i'm glad he made his video i'm glad he's got 115 000 views i i hope this is the most successful video he's he's ever made and which is why even though i don't know what three four thousand people maybe total after three months will see this video no big deal i'm not worried about it mr rationality helped me because what it shows is that c.s lewis's picture where he he draws this whole thing and says i believe in christianity because by it i can see everything well why because by it i'm getting a little closer to see this monarchical view of reality that actually in fact all the scientists are using and asserting but not really owning up to at least peterson is owning up to it and this is why peterson calls harris and dawkins and mr rationality i assume but he's mr rationality is lower on the hierarchy than him so he's not going to get this is why he calls them newtonians and this is why peterson says i'm a darwinian well lewis is a christian and for lewis lewis as a christian can fit in darwin andy can fit in tolkien andy can fit in the bible and peterson still working this out as he says he says because by the sun i can see it all jordan prederson jordan peterson brings god back because he needs him now harris and weinstein ally with peterson on science because they need to keep it beyond the human observer science has a problem with democracy um it just is harrison weinstein are depending on jordan peterson's god just as much as peterson is but they can't see it philosophically because they assume or assert the absolute validity of inference which is in fact as c.s lewis calls it a mare's nest well is it a mare's nest well what do you mean by that well think about it peterson rightly footnotes inference with god and what's amazing is that he got there by psychology and again peterson is a pragmatist we need god to validate the inference move so that we can believe in science and this is why jordan peterson does his biblical series and why jordan peterson had to get into young and all of this other stuff this is why he's a gateway drug to religion because he needs to bring god back into the picture or he loses his science and peterson has figured this out because he saw the u.s and the soviet union ready to destroy everyone in the world over ideas and because peterson is watching the post modernists or the people he's calling post modernist threaten to destroy all this idea and peterson says we got to bring the old guy back now this doesn't this isn't an argument for the existence of the old guy he's a pragmatist we need him because the system doesn't work without him we can't know god exists but we need god for the system that knowledge is good enough to keep doing science we should act as if god is real and the same way scientists act as if there is an observer an eternal observer that was there before the singularity that watched the thing unfold that watched one reality unfold one all-knowing completely penetrating reality that is unbiased and sees everything absolutely down to its core now you might say well no such being exists okay you don't believe in such a being but you can't do science without acting as if such an eternal omniscient completely unbiased observer exists this observer and the imagination of this server observer is required for any storytelling in science now harris might deny that weinstein might deny that but peterson is saying and he hasn't said this quite this way so if he disagrees with me he's free to talk to me but again i'm way down the status hierarchy but this is the point this is why we're having this conversation and the real reason we're having this conversation is because i think what i've learned from peterson is right that we have this internal yungian cloud of witnesses and and so a lot of us are out there watching jordan peterson and we're we're absorbing this stuff just like we absorbed the subtraction story just like we absorbed getting rid of god just like we absorbed all of that peterson is talking this way and the little the little the little motivations in my mind are watching and listening and they're saying you know why jordan peterson is bringing back god because if you lose this god you lose science well what does louis say the scientific point of view cannot fit in any of these things not even science itself i believe in christianity as i believe that the sun has risen not because i see it but because by it i see everything else so i'm gonna have to make another stab at miracles chapter two and figure out how to do my little videos because you know this what i'm doing here is is pretty much thinking out loud with you now i hope this has been helpful and uh i'm really interested to see what you're gonna have to say about this video and yeah mr rationality if you want to talk you know where to find me but i'm just a little 4k guy and you're a 35k guy jordan peterson's a 750 000k guy so um we'll just have this conversation with my my 4000 subscribers and we'll have fun with it because the truth is um i believe that finally and this gets freddy asked me today now mention our show and your show so more people watch it i believe that helping freddy this morning with what i helped him with and dealing with all the little annoyances there in uh that we had i believe that all of that is um at least as important as making my silly little video and i believe it because actually within christianity i can fit science and i can fit freddy and i can fit the details of my life and i also believe that well let's say um the guy cheated on his wife and she just couldn't believe his lying eyes and so she took her life and the madman pressed the nuclear button and that within all of this frame it is not all in vain it means something
