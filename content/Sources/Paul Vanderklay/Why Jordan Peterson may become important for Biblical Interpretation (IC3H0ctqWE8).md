 Yesterday I hit y'all with a huge slug of stuff on Jordan Peterson's fourth fourth thing in the biblical series and today I want to do some I'm gonna pick up on a little bit of it and then I'm gonna do some real orientation in terms of where I think some of the interesting pieces are in terms of what Jordan Peterson is doing in raising interest with people about the Bible and also where this kind of fits theologically in terms of what the Bible is and how this fits in to the history of interpretation of the Bible so I'm gonna hit a lot of stuff with my little drawings in this video so hang on so yeah this is kind of the kind of the next in this series on Peterson and the Bible and I'm just gonna show a few seconds because I think this illustrates both exactly how he's using the Bible in his biblical series and why many listening to it who had previously dismissed the Bible as not being credible now are finding credibility in the Bible so let's take a peek some other representations this one I like the one on the left that's paradise as a walled garden and that's what paradise means it's paradisa which is I don't remember the language it's associated with Persian paradisa means walled garden and why a walled garden well it goes back to the chaos order idea so this is where God puts man and woman after the creation in a walled garden well the wall is culture and order and the garden is nature and the idea is the proper human habitat is nature and culture in balance it's well we like gardens well why okay and that's that's that's all we really need here to see what's going on so let's let's jump back to the PowerPoint and let's this is this is I would say the heart of his method with the biblical series this is the this is the heart of his project of trying to figure out the Bible and what he's doing and why I think a lot of people are watching his biblical series and saying I have newfound credibility in the Bible now what I'm about to do is probably gonna disturb some of you and it's gonna disturb some Christians over here and it's gonna disturb some Peterson fans over there but if I'm gonna be if I'm not gonna be a lying pastor I'm gonna tell you exactly what I think and let's let's work through these now this is essentially what's happening here so you have Peterson in the middle and he's saying look at this walled garden this is and this is an image and this image you know if you've been following Peterson's view this image has come down to us through the archetypes through our evolution through our biology through watching each other this this entire framework of chaos and order is is perfectly illustrated in the story of the Garden of Eden as a walled garden and maybe in my next video I'll open up logos and pull up the Hebrew and take a little bit of look at that it's but yeah there it is it's you're finding the walled garden which is an ideal representation of chaos and order which is obviously Peterson's big framing you know is big framing metaphor for life in the world and the logos and this this whole thing fits together with chaos and order in his new book 12 rules for life and antidote to chaos and the idea that we're at our most productive when we're when we've got chaos and I've said before that I think this is a this is a tremendously powerful tremendously insightful tremendously practical way of conceptualizing what it means to live here and it's incredibly to live as human beings in this world it's this this really works well and and one of the things that I've been blessed by through this whole process is seeing yeah this this this way of talking this language this this framework in terms of looking at ourselves psychologically even religiously theologically this this is a very this is a very powerful system and so then when Peterson says well this is the first story in the Bible now suddenly we all look at this and we say wow I I had dismissed the Bible as you know it's just some myths out there written by archaic people and maybe I associated it with with evil and violence and patriarchy and anti-women stuff and so but now seeing this all and Jordan Peterson's new like I like I knew have a I have a newfound respect for the Bible and so I want to study the Bible and so on and so forth well that's psychological and that's how we work now it's okay now I'm gonna be fair because basically before the scientific before recent developments in the scientific revolution in biology through Darwin in geology where suddenly these new sciences casted tremendous doubt on the old stories of the world because what had happened in the old stories of the world was they said hey do you want validation of the flood that we find in the Bible well look at the Grand Canyon and and so there you know there's your validation I believe the Bible because I believe the Grand Canyon and I know that the Grand Canyon was was produced by the process of erosion and so when I read the biblical story about the flood and I see the Grand Canyon I say aha! and then of course later on geologists come along and say oh no it wasn't it wasn't a global flood we don't have any any evidence for a global flood and then of course creation scientists come along and say oh let's not be so sure and my take on it is let the let the creation sciences scientists have at it I my opinion is not unlike Brett Weinstein's position position in his talk on the Rubin report where he said you know don't don't shut down the the the climate change skeptics and let them have their say in court let them you know don't know platform them let them speak and then weigh the evidence now we're going to get into this evidence we're going to get into this way of belief with respect to evidence because this also has a historical foundation and that's why I want to talk about Descartes and Locke and and we'll get there eventually too but you know my point is that what Jordan Peterson is doing with respect to the walled garden and chaos and order is exactly psychologically in terms of our belief creating mechanism the same process by which 200 years ago people argued that aha! the Bible is is true because we find the flood in it and we see that in the Grand Canyon there's a word that that's often been used by used of this method with creation scientists with respect to the Bible it's called concordism that there's a there's a concord between what they're finding in the book and what they're finding in nature and that basically is validation and then gives the Bible credibility now now as a pastor I see this all the time with people in terms of their own private reading of the Bible someone will say to me pastor doesn't the Bible say lo I will be with you to the ends of the earth and I just got back from the doctor and the doctor says I'm cancer free see God was with me and now it's important to recognize how this conversation goes between Christians and skeptics because Christians will say I'm cancer free and skeptics will say I see the validation in my life of what the Bible tells me skeptics will say ah but you can do that with anything and that's part of the point here is that you've you've somehow got to ask the question where's the bigger frame how can we not just be reading into the text we know that we are our brains have a tremendous capacity to recognize patterns and so this is of course the the fertile ground of conspiracy theories that when we see something in the news we have suspicious in our suspicions in our minds we have a little bit of evidence and we say aha this is what's going on beneath the surface and this gives rise to almost everything that human beings do now it's it's awfully nice to imagine that you know I am a person who is I alone and objected and am objective and unbiased and I alone don't somehow make up patterns because I see the truth and with Peterson as he says in a number of his lectures well I'm I'm kind of doubtful because you're a human being just like me and we're all equipped with the same stuff and it doesn't mean we've all got the same capacity or the same experience this is a pattern that we do now you might say well this is a pattern that we shouldn't do and we should be purely scientific but if for example you read Thomas Kuhn's history of scientific revolutions you'll see that no this this pattern is is is completely within science and and usually through some pretty vigorous methodology maybe in some small instances we can you know get down to some harder data but for the most part everything in our world is subject to this we cannot escape this pattern in terms of forming our beliefs and so again what Jordan Peterson does with the walled garden and associating it with chaos order what saw it what people did 300 years ago with respect to the flood and the Grand Canyon what Christians do today who have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ they say see the Bible is the word of God it's true I experience of that because I see that validated in my regular life experience now pointing this out I am not saying yes or no with respect to this I am just saying this is a fully human way of living life in this world and in fact it is not just subject to religion some of you might remember if you're old enough the election of 2008 when Barack Obama won the presidency a lot of people you know a lot you know obviously with every election there's a lot of prognostication who's going to win Nate Silver who had been doing a lot of work with sports odds and all of this stuff in 538.com predicted Barack Obama would win that suddenly gave huge credibility to Nate Silver huge validation to his methods everybody was watching him everybody paid attention to him in the 2012 election but then of course come along the 2016 election and bang he got it wrong he predicted Hillary would win along with just about everybody else and so now suddenly Nate Silver does not have the shine on him that he used to now this again happens again and again in our personal lives that has happened throughout history and will happen with Jordan Peterson I mean this is how human history works now it's very interesting those of you who know your Bible pretty well know that in Deuteronomy 18 there is a test of a prophet and the test of the prophet goes like this if the prophet makes a prediction and the prediction comes true the prophet is vindicated if the prophet makes a prediction and the prediction doesn't come true the prophet has to be put to death now this I'm sure gave some people some real hesitation about getting into the the prophet business because prognostication is a pretty difficult thing but now of course the assumption here is that if there is a god and the god knows the future well the god should be able to talk to the prophet and the prophet knows the future and the prophet should be able to reveal that to the people and the people should be able to listen to that and then be able to evaluate the prophets and kill off the bad ones who are just you know wrong or blowing smoke and let the good ones live because they're pretty handy folks to have around now fortunately we didn't string up Nate Silver after he got the 2016 election wrong but this very much gets into you know conceptions of the world now one of the things that I do want to get into more because I think part of what is interesting about Jordan Peterson is that in some ways he is putting the world back together in terms of the Bible in some new ways now this has been the dominant model and I'm going to get there's a lot that's going into this is a very low resolution picture the dominant model among most traditional religious people imagine that their holy book in a sense is the book of Mormon and in a sense falls from the sky now this is where theological definitions of the manner of inspiration get important because for example the the book of Mormon if you listen to the the Church of Latter-day Saints story you know the angel Moroni directs Joseph Smith to dig up this book and then there are some seeing that the Bible is dictated to the prophet Muhammad and this is sometimes called mechanical inspiration or the dictation theory that that God told Moses right to what to write down now I find a fair number of Christians who don't know a lot of theology sporting methods like this and I find and there are some Christian groups who do know a fair amount of theology that sport this this method to this theory of interpretation and I find a lot of non-Christians assume Christians have this kind of theory and so the Bible is the word of God the Bible dropped down from heaven to earth and that way when we find all kinds of lackings in Concordism when we find when we go back through history and say see you got the flood wrong therefore I can't believe it but then when Jordan Peterson comes along and says see you get the walled garden right in terms of my chaos and order metaphor well now we've got validation and then of course it rises or falls on any individual that just tries it sometimes people do what's called the lucky dip they take their Bible and and they say Lord speak to me and they open it and they read something and I know many people who who will tell me they became a Christian because what they read in the Bible just spoke to them and it made sense and now they believe now I am not going to disparage that this is fully human this is how we pick up beliefs and those of us who have imagined well I've got all these reasons and all these articulations and and my beliefs are so esoteric and I'm right either because I have this experience now I've been getting some I've been getting a lot of notes from some of the young community that are a little frustrated a little frustrated with me because I'm doing all this rational work over here and and what they say is well you really need an experience now now when they talk to me like this I hear also some Pentecostals over here on this side and I want to be fair to all sides and my my fairness says this on one hand do not disregard experience and do not disregard reason reason and experience are two ways of knowing these are two gifts of knowing things and and we have to work through these things human beings believe things for human reasons and we will always be human in the way we believe and this of course frustrates people over here on the rational side that like to say and I think Peterson gets this exactly right when when people say well if we can only get people to believe rationally then we'll all believe the same thing yeah good luck now that's not how people work when people and it's our excuse me if we can only get people to read get rid of their religious beliefs their experiential beliefs their biased beliefs if they can only believe via pure reason then they would suddenly throw off religion and and be totally rational creatures and I think Peterson gets this dead on right it's true to the experience that I've seen with people that when people reject religion it's not that they don't believe anything as GK Chesterton now this is probably another apocryphal GK Chesterton quote they'll believe anything and and the same goes for the experiential side that says if you only you would have this experience and then what churches and churches and lots of other groups try to do this then you know gin up the experience so well let's take a psychedelic or let's you know let's put you in this church service and let's get all the right music going and let's get the let's get the the church let's get the preacher to preach exactly the right sermon that really hits on all the emotional buttons you need to hit and then at the end of the service you come up to the pastor and say this was this was revelation to me and and so then you'll join the church now as a pastor I do have the experience of sometimes people come into my church and they will they'll come into my church for the first time and they'll they'll hear them they'll hear my sermon and tears will be flowing down my eyes and they'll say things like pastor I've never seen a church like this before I've never seen a preacher like you before you know I believe everything that you say is true and you spoke to my heart and on one hand I say praise God I'm glad I'm glad this sermon spoke to your heart another part of me says you've probably had a whole bunch of things in your life that have led up to this moment of experience and this was a powerful experience for you that's wonderful maybe this will be transformational in terms of your life or maybe it won't because I've seen it go both ways with people and sometimes the person who is sitting in the front row crying their eyes out after the service professing that I'm the greatest preacher they've ever heard two months from now I'll be the devil himself this is the way human beings are and this is the way we form beliefs and so to notice what Jordan Peterson is doing and how this is fully human to me does not say it's not true does not say it's random does not say it's not valid but is to say it's all data and it's part of what we have to work through now so and this is part of the reason that theologically I am I don't deny the possibility of a book coming from heaven but theologically I don't believe this is the majority position of the Christian faith and this is throughout time even and I don't believe that this is in fact where we get the Bible from and I don't think that holding this position really helps your case in terms of defending the Bible because those who hold this position again usually go back and say something like this and then someone comes along and says ha that we can explain the Grand Canyon in another way besides the flood therefore you know your Bible's all wrong that's you won't establish the credibility of the Bible in terms of a proof or an airtight case and this is where when I when I talk about different modes of Christian apologetics and a modernist approach what I find is that modernists tend to take on what I call the kind of a foundational belief system now part of the reason I don't sport a foundational belief system like this is because I was trained not in it this isn't divine revelation this isn't because I'm so smart I am also the product of my tradition and when I went to Calvin College I took a fifth year so I could get all my Greek in and I took a course by Nick Waltersdorf and this was the textbook I had and this is a this was a book written by Nick Waltersdorf and Alvin Plank and it's about faith and rationality and if you look at Alvin Plantinga's work you'll see that he goes into this question of whether belief in God can be basic and in a sense what Waltersdorf and Plantinga do in this book and actually the last chapter of Philip Carey's great courses series on philosophy and religion in the west deals with the work of Plantinga and Waltersdorf who are again from the Christian Reformed Church and you know this is my tradition and so this is where I work usually more from a presuppositional apologetics mode but that manner of thinking you know cuts all the way right through so this is in a sense an illustration of what mechanical inspiration looks like this is an illustration of what organic inspiration looks like and basically organic inspiration is a And basically organic inspiration says that the Bible is the word of God and the Bible is the product of God's moving in history and sometimes when people will write me letters and ask me specific pastoral questions I will usually tell them that the God of redemption is the same God of creation which means that I believe I'm a Calvinist okay I believe in a very thorough I believe in a very thorough very thick version of providence and that's hard for a lot of people to hold because you know along with a lot of what Calvin said you know God brings good years and lean years and I think that's the way that I think of it and I think that's the way that I think of it I believe in a very thorough very thick version of providence and that's hard for a lot of people to hold because you know along with a lot of what Calvin said you know God brings good years and lean years and so later on in the history of Western civilization when people say well don't you believe in free will I usually like to say I think we have real agency Free is awfully broad and for example I think it would be really hard for me to embrace the religious beliefs of the Aztecs simply because the historical milieu in which I was raised and embedded makes a lot of the beliefs of the Aztecs hard to believe now I'm taking sociology of knowledge seriously and what that means is that for a lot of people they're throwing away of Christianity comes naturally and it'll be probably a mixture of where they're embedded in history and the experiences that they have and this is why I as a pastor I'll listen to someone and okay for some reason we'll bump into each other and for some reason we'll get into a conversation and because I'm a pastor for some reason they'll start talking about their past experience with church and they very well might say well I'm going to go to church and I'm going to go to church and I'm going to go to church and I'm going to go to church and I'm going to go to church and I'm going to go to church and I'm going to go to church and I'm going to go to church and I'm going to go to church and I'm going to go to church and I'm going to go to church and I'm going to go to church and I'm going to go to church and I'm going to go to church and I'm going to go to church and I'm going to go to church and the pastor did this or an elder did that or someone said something mean to me or someone said something I couldn't believe or someone did something that was offensive morally to me so I can no longer I no longer go to church and I no longer believe the bible so on and so forth. Bible or so on and so forth. And so in other words, we have this whole mixture of how we form beliefs. And this is not disconnected from history, which is why, in my opinion, a belief in the organic inspiration of Scripture is really foundational. Now what's interesting is that, in a sense, Jordan Peterson is coming along. And you might notice I put the square quotes, the square, the scare quotes on God instead of Bible is word of God all in quotes, Bible is word of God. So what is God? The idea of God. And, you know, this is a live part of the conversation around Jordan Peterson is what exactly does Jordan Peterson's God look like? And I think that's an interesting question. And I think he's being completely honest, if you listen to him. I think part of the difficulty is that he leaves, he is in many ways an agnostic with a bias towards openness to God and ontology, than say many agnostics that have a bias against God and ontology. And again, this gets into the not small conversation of what is God and how can we talk about him. And in fact, if you go back over the history of philosophy and religion, you'll see that this is not a small thing, even though for most people, if you say the word God, they will think of, well, whatever they think of in terms of their presuppositions and their history of belief. So in some ways, you know, I tried to make a little lobster there. I'm not an artist, so I do just stick figures. But in some ways, through dreams, symbols, archetypes, myths, the Bible is the revelation of God, depending on exactly what you mean by God. Now, this is certainly not mechanic. Is it organic? I think it's highly organic. And then interesting questions are going to be, well, is there anything that a more traditional Christian like me can learn from this? Now, I just read an article from Reformed Theonomists. Now, in terms of the church family, they are cousins of my position. I'm an Amil Calvinist Reformed preacher. They tend to be Post-Mil and they have some very interesting ideas of reconstruction. And there are some pretty fierce in-house debates between my tribe and that tribe. And so when I read their take on Jordan Peterson, I wasn't surprised by what they said. So I want to get into a little bit and some of my videos coming are going to lay out, continue to lay out this framework of biblical interpretation. Up until the Protestant Reformation, there was a lot going on in terms of biblical interpretation. There was always the literal or I'd rather say physical or historical layer of interpretation when people would read the Bible. There was the allegorical layer of interpretation. And I talked a little bit about this with respect to origin. And there was the moral interpretation of the Bible. And if you go to Wikipedia, you can find a really nice treatment of medieval allegorical interpretation of the Bible that lays a lot of this out. Many great saints of the church practiced this, such as Augustine and some, you know, people who were denounced as heretics of the church, but still instrumental in the development of the church, like Origen practiced this. And this was practiced throughout the Middle Ages. And I have a very interesting book that goes into the history of interpretation of the book of Genesis. And I'll probably be pulling out some of that material as the conversation continues. But through the first 1500 years of the church, these modes of interpretation dominated. And now it could be that next week I'm going to have a conversation with Jonathan Pageot. And if I just caught a tweet of Jonathan's yesterday that he basically said, you know, I don't use Jung. And people are like, well, why don't you use Jung for your symbolic interpretation of the Bible? And that's because Jonathan is part of the Orthodox tradition, and they are deeply rooted in the church fathers. And so they are swimming in this symbolic representation and symbolic language of the Bible. And I think, and this again, I think we'll probably get into some of my conversation with Jonathan, that symbolism is in itself a trans-cultural language. And so snakes mean something. You know, there's a song years ago, I Don't Like Spiders and Snakes, this is because this is what a guy brought to the woman. And I think Jordan Peterson could have a lot of fun with I Don't Like Spiders and Snakes. But this is where we get into the conversation about archetypes. And so in some ways, when Jonathan Pageot was talking about symbolism, he's pre-archetypal language. He's way, way pre-Jung. This is man from the Orthodox tradition. And I don't know a lot about the Orthodox tradition. I know some people who are in it. But what I do know is that these folks live in their history and within their liturgy, within the practices of their church, they live in that history. And so, you know, Jonathan is very much back in this symbolic era of the church. And now what happens, and I've run through some of this history before, and I will again, what happens in the Protestant Reformation in the West are huge transformations. Now remember, East and West split about a thousand, about a thousand A.D. in the Great Schism, and partly over language, Greek versus Latin. But in the Protestant Reformation, the Protestant Reformation is the culmination of a tremendous number of pent-up movements that have been developing in Europe. And these movements are political. These movements are economic. These movements are educational. And these movements are religious. You know, all of our life is tied together in these things. And so, you know, in the Protestant Reformation, you have the developments that you have increasing rates of literacy with the printing press, which of course, fuels more literacy. The Protestant Reformation very much addressed laxity, moral laxity, corruption in the clergy and in the papacy. If, you know, what many scholars will note that Martin Luther, in a sense, failed to reform the Roman Catholic Church in the way that he desired to, but in other ways succeeded to reform the Roman Catholic Church in a number of ways, sometimes against his desire, sometimes in alignment with them, because in order to face the threat of the Protestant Reformation, the Roman Catholic Church in many ways did clean up its act in a number of areas. And some of the egregious corruption that was seen in the medieval papacy was addressed in time. Charles Taylor, in his huge book, A Secular Age, talks about reform, whereas what you see in pre-Reformation, there was, in a sense, two speeds of Christianity. You had the monastic movement where you had the super Christians, and they, in a sense, were helping give merit and prayers and spiritual mojo to regular Christian folk who kind of had this entry level of Christianity. What happens in the Protestant Reformation is that the Protestants say, oh no, there should be one speed of Christian. All Christians should be holy. No, you know, having mistresses and being corrupt, but then going to mass and, you know, having the sacraments cleanse you of sin. Christians need to be up to speed, and so when you get to John Calvin's Geneva, yeah, these Calvinists are bearing down on people, and they want everybody in the city to really be a Christian. And when you get to the pilgrims in Boston, you know, church is mandatory, and we're going to elevate our entire Christian community. Now, if you look even at conversations and things going on today, you see this one speed versus two speed thing going on, not only in religious traditions, but in political traditions, in moral conversations, and in ethical conversations. So this one speed versus two speed is very much a dynamic that goes on in the Protestant Reformation, essentially said to the Roman Catholic Church, no more two speed. We only want one speed. And there were many in the Roman Catholic Church, you know, think of, let's say, St. Francis, who very much wanted, you know, one speed of Christian, but many people say, hey, I can't devote all my time to prayer. You know, you monks, you go pray for me. I'll live out here in the real world, and this then gets into some competing worldviews in terms of, say, nature and grace, and how the Protestants changed a lot of those conversations. And so for the Protestants, all of life is religious, whereas, you know, in the medieval system, you have nature and grace, and again, the two speed. Well, and in the long times, the Enlightenment and Descartes and Hume and Kant, and the conversations continue to change. And then we, and then, you know, we kind of, if you look back over my videos, you have the, you know, the rationalists up in the cloud and the empiricists down below, and then theologically, you get this system where you have special revelation, which in a sense comes from God. Now, again, traditionally, historically, special revelation comes from God organically, but it's imagined, again, to be, to in a sense, trump in some cases, general revelation, and knowledge is where we put special revelation and general revelation together. For example, if you read the Belgian Confession, which is one of the doctrinal statements of my church and my tradition, the Belgian Confession articulates a viewpoint which wasn't uncommon in the 16th century, and far earlier that God reveals himself through two books. God reveals himself through general revelation, so we should listen to science, and special revelation, which is something different from science. And okay, now we're getting into the tensions between special revelation and general revelation. For example, if Genesis says, God created the world in six days, and Darwin says that humans evolved over a great period of time, well, who are you going to believe, special revelation or general revelation? And so many Christians come along and say, well, I believe God because God over science. So there you have Bible and science working like this. And as Peterson has noted in many other notes, those conversations in the Roman Catholic tradition and the Orthodox traditions are different because those two churches predate this conflict, and so therefore their worlds come together in different ways. And this is why Jonathan Pujol can tweet, I've never read Jung. I get all of my symbolic ideas from the Bible, from the church fathers. And if you watch some of Jonathan's videos, I think they're, I think they're wonderful. I'm learning a ton about the Orthodox tradition and some Eastern fathers that by virtue of my Western Christian education, I've not been privy to. So this tremendously complicated history is going on. And so then in a sense you say, well, the Bible is special revelation and science is general revelation. But now pay attention where we started a few minutes ago. Once, and I'm going to do a little video on history of philosophy because that's tracking here. Once we hit Descartes and we look at the mystics, which is a sense older, we say, well, truth is found within me. Well, what do you mean about that? Well, this is truth to me. And again, all of this stuff is in the water now and people are picking little parts out and it's, you know, it's self-referentially affirming to say, well, I see truth as I see it. And on the one hand, that's true and you can't argue with it. On the other hand, you have to say, yeah, but is it right? Are you really true? There's, is there an objective world out there? And this again, is a big part of the Peterson conversation. And now if you look at the traditional way within this framework of understanding the Bible, a tradition of biblical interpretation arises that I call the I call, I learned it this way. This is what it's called the grammatical historical, the grammatical historical, the grammatical historical approach of biblical interpretation. Now, what that means is that the Bible is a book and the Bible has words and the Bible has a history and you can study empirically the words of the Bible and you can do textual criticism and look at the history of the text and you can look at the grammar of sentences and you can basically try to go all the way back and connect up the Bible and history. And so what happens as a result of the enlightenment of this new approach to knowledge is that people get a little nervous about allegorical interpretation and symbolic interpretation and they say that isn't, that doesn't find credibility. And what we're really looking for is credibility. And so we say, well, you know, there's history and so I have to connect the Bible with history. But then of course, when you show that, well, the Bible doesn't seem to be, your ability to tie the Bible and history together seems to not be working, therefore the Bible has no credibility. Jordan Peterson comes along and says, but in my view, the Bible has credibility. Huh, well, isn't that interesting? So this is the grammatical historical approach to interpretation and most of the commentaries behind me are within that school. And this gets into the school of, after the Reformation, the desire is to approach theology as a science. Why? Well, because what happens in the West is that science becomes the predominant way of us knowing. And this is sometimes called scientism. And we get the idea that I can't know anything beyond what I can know through science. Now, in the postmodern period, this view has been taking a beating, which is why you will find some Christians celebrating postmodernity. Now, postmodernity, there's a political expression, there's a religious expression. Postmodernity is one term that is addressing an enormous range of things and it's getting slapped on all kinds of things. And so it's really important when people, when you hear people talk about postmodernity, well, which aspect of postmodernity are you addressing? And, you know, Peterson uses this a lot, but if you listen to enough Peterson, he's smart enough to know that, you know, there's a lot to this. And so when he uses it in certain frames of reference, understand it within that frame of reference, because all of this language is determined and intelligible within specific frames of reference. So the grammatical historical study of the Bible is all part of this desire to have theology be scientific and to have our knowledge of God be scientific. Well, and then what happens is that the cosmology changes. And whereas before we had a cosmology that said something like this, where you have the firmament and the flat earth and the heavens above and God lives in the heavens. Well, what happens to people's ability to believe when space replaces the heavens, when we're now on a round globe circling the sun, and if you're really reading your Bible carefully, you'll notice that you really can't find that in the Bible. And so when I talk to people about this, some people will say, oh, no, the Bible very clearly has us on a globe going around the heavens. And I've got a problem with that because of my grammatical historical study of the Bible, because in fact, we can do all the kind of work that John Walton is doing and saying, hey, wait a minute, the representation of the Bible in Genesis one is exactly what we would expect to find in the ancient Near East context. Well, what does that do to my Concordism? Hmm. But then right away, you're in the middle of a very big conversation in terms of your Concordisms and how your world comes together. And when Jordan Peterson says, yeah, we don't like people messing with our belief systems. Oh, yeah, he's dead right. We don't like that at all. We don't respond well to this kind of stuff at all. And so when space replaces heavens, what tends to happen is that most people make tiny little adjustments in their worldview. And because, and I think the pragmatists get this right, we're mostly formed on practical things. And a good many Christians aren't worried about cosmology or any of these things. And they basically have an experiential, they basically have an experience of Jesus says, I will be with you. And they are finding emotional relief in Jesus. And they are finding, you know, Concordisms in their life. I prayed and these things happen. And again, you'll find many Christians, they keep a log of their prayers, and then they keep a log of their answered prayers. Now again, you can look at this as a skeptic and say, ah, that's just reading onto things. Oh, okay, maybe. But you know, we all read onto things. This is how we live. And so I find it better to not be a skeptic or a cynic about all of these things and say, this is what it means to live as a human being. You can't live without Concordism. But it's got to be a part of the far larger matrix of how we believe and what we believe. So back to the story. So then space replaces the heavens. And then the Bible is just another book because, you know, who'd have thought that when we did all this archaeology in the ancient Near East, we would dig up Gilgamesh and we would dig up other Gospels that didn't get traction and become part of the Christian canon. And now suddenly, we've got all of these other religions and we're saying, well, we can all get together, and this is again part of the history I told before, we can all get together on what we agree to in the physical world. And maybe we'll have science be the way by which we can have agreement. And this is the basis of the secular frame. This is the basis of, in a sense, the American experiment, where we say, we're not going to, we're going to have a separation of church and state. The government isn't going to impose a religion on the people and will just eventually let some semblance of democracy consensus. If a majority of Americans believe that gay marriage is immoral, then it will be illegal. If a majority of Americans believe that gay marriage is just fine, then it will be legal. If a majority of Americans believe that incest is immoral, then it will be illegal. If a majority of Americans believe that incest is fine, then it will be legal. If a majority of Americans think that you should not have sex, a 35-year-old and a 16-year-old shouldn't have sex, but that's statutory rate, then it'll be illegal. If a majority of Americans believe otherwise, then it will be legal. And this is where we go. But we also have science in the practice because we would say, well, science can't tell us whether or not gay marriage is correct or not. Okay, science can't tell you that. But say, well, no, no, maybe science can. And now we're in the midst of all of these conversations that we're having here. Enter Jordan Peterson. What is Peterson doing? Well, Peterson is making, and he said this to Prager, and I know some people didn't like the fact that, you know, we've all got our tribes, and I know a lot of folks who listen to this, you got your political tribe, you got your religious tribe, and, you know, if I take a poke at your religious tribe or your political tribe, it'll be upset. I'm high in openness, and I'm a pretty happy guy, and, you know, I know how to live with a lot of people with a lot of differences. So, yeah, Prager says, oh, he's religious. Well, yeah. Well, how is Jordan Peterson changing things up? Well, in a sense, Jordan Peterson is saying, hmm, how can we, I'm not going to say science invalidates the Bible, I'm going to say science validates the Bible, and I'm going to give you an origin story that goes through Darwin and Jung and Piaget, and I'm going to show you my concordisms between walls and the Bible and paradise and the Bible and the story of Adam and Eve and fruit and color in terms of the development of the brain and how this perhaps is all coded into our DNA and how the archetype is as old as lobster, so it's older than trees, and how this whole thing works together, and I'm going to say that the Bible is the word of God, and you can put God in scare quotes, now he hasn't been using that phrase, but this is, in a sense, the door he's knocking on, that the Bible is the word of God if we imagine God to be something like this, and the Bible's validation comes with, through the evolution of texts and mythology and culture, and wow, okay, this is, to me, a really interesting development, and I know a lot of Christians are going to be taking their takes on Peterson, and most of us, when we take an initial low resolution of someone, we approach them as a tool, and we ask ourselves, does Jordan Peterson help or hurt my overall agenda, and if my agenda is religious, and I hear that Jordan Peterson is helping people get more religious, I say, huh, that sounds good, if my agenda is Marxist, and I hear Jordan Peterson, you know, having all kinds of people following him, and he hates Marxist, I say, oh, I hate Jordan Peterson, I'm going to do a hit piece on that, was that Mike or Mick or something that did this video on him, which was, you know, completely unfair, and, you know, well, this is exactly what we do, we take a low resolution snapshot, we approach the person as we do a tool, and we say, does Jordan Peterson help or hurt whatever cause I find dear, and then we proceed to either try and boost his reputation or tear down his reputation, and this is the game we see at play, and I think this is not the most fruitful game, I don't think this is a very mature game, and now someone might say, well, yeah, you're doing the same thing, you're a tribalist, and of course I'm a tribalist, but what I'm trying to do is take a much higher resolution picture of Jordan Peterson and say, okay, what exactly is going on here, and I actually think some really important stuff is going on here, and some really interesting stuff is going on here, on a whole number of levels in terms of the longer conversation of what is the Bible, and why do we believe it, and why do groups of people believe it, and again, you might, if this is the only video you listen to, you say, you're forming your low resolution picture of Paul VanderKlay and say, Paul isn't a Christian, Paul's not a real Christian, Paul's not my kind of Christian, because he's not Roman Catholic or Orthodox or Baptist or even a theonomist, Paul's not, Paul, I don't want to hear Paul's voice because Paul didn't vote for Trump, or Paul didn't vote for Hillary, or Paul's not a sufficient capitalist, or Paul's not a sufficient socialist, or whatever the heck Paul VanderKlay is, and it doesn't really matter, because truth be told, in the great story of Western civilization, I will be forgotten quicker than anything, and I'm, yeah, that's going to happen, so it doesn't really matter, and I'm an insignificant player, which gives me the freedom to say, I think all of this is a very interesting conversation theologically, I think it's very interesting socially, and I think this is part of the ongoing story, will it be a big part or not? I don't know, but I think it's a part of the ongoing story of the church and biblical interpretation and belief and religion, and I think it's pretty cool, so let me know what you think, and I know, you know, the Jungians that are waiting for me to have my experience, I've had plenty of religious experiences, I don't think I'm going to become a Jungian, for those who are waiting for me to ditch my religion, no, that's not going to happen either, for those who are hoping that I'll be on your political tribe and endorse your view, well, maybe I am, maybe I'm not, that's not really the ground I'm working in, but I, this is part of the reason I do all these videos, because I'm thinking this stuff through, and the deeper I dig into this, the more I say, well, number one, I'm finding it helpful, number two, it's bringing me into very good conversations with lots of interesting people, not only on the internet, but also locally, and to me, this is, this is my job, this is what I do as a pastor, I, do I promote my Christian Reformed Calvinist views, absolutely, this is, this is who I am, I don't disparage a Baptist for promoting their views, or a Roman Catholic for promoting their views, or an Orthodox, or an atheist, this is, this is the game we're playing, use your influence, increase your tribe, all of that is good, of course I think I'm right, everybody thinks they're right, if you don't think you're right, you change your ideas, that's how belief works, so, let's have fun with this, and, and there's some serious social and political conversations, that's not the emphasis of my work with this, because I do think Peterson has at least opened up for me the path of some discipline in figuring out how the world works, so, there's a little video for today, hopefully it's not too
