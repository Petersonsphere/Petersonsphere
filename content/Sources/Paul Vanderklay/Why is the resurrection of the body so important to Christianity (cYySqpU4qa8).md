 Hi, this is Paul and this is my rough draft Sunday video. I do these most weeks that I preach because I'm working on my sermon and I run through it and I found that uploading it to YouTube has been a good exercise. Some of you seem to enjoy it. I get some good feedback and as always some of you are also interested in my process. Working on a sermon, it's the same head that did the video I posted yesterday with Scott Adams and Sam Harris and Matt Delahunty and Jordan Peterson. So you'll notice some of the same ideas running through my head. So I run through it this way and I usually learn a lot running through it. I'll do some more edits before Sunday and then lately I've been posting a link to the Sunday message in the show notes after I do it. I have a separate channel for my church videos, mostly my Sunday school class and my Sunday sermon. It's a little different from this format so I just put them on a separate channel. A lot of people say live in the moment, live in the now and there's a lot behind that statement. I did my little Google image zeitgeist search and got all of these memes and living in the moment with a beautiful sunset and a beautiful mountain view and there's something really about us and moments. In some ways one way to view a life is a series of moments. We always live in the moment. And so when we admonish people to live in the moment, it's not exactly clear what we're asking of them. One of my favorites of these memes was Cookie Monster, today me live in the moment unless it's unpleasant in which case me will eat a cookie. The problem is if you have many unpleasant moments and you eat many cookies, these things tend to compound and too many cookies over a lifetime doesn't necessarily lead to all that many more moments. And for the Jordan Peterson fans out there, he always talks about this clip so I went and looked for it and here it is. Someday these kids will be out of the house and you'll regret not spending more time with them. That's a problem for future Homer. Man, I don't envy that guy. You know I watch this video and I think about a friend of mine who was a homeless man and a terrible alcoholic and I remember sitting with him on a beautiful morning on a bench overlooking Florin Road on our property and he was sitting there with a bottle of, I don't know, bourbon or something and a jug of half and half and pouring them together. And I thought, yeah, that's living in the moment and it's the sum of all these moments because the reason he's cutting, you know, he's mixing half and half and bourbon together is because that's the only way he can get it down his system anymore. All of those moments of drinking has left his esophagus and his stomach just ravaged. You know, we are material creatures with an odd consciousness experience. One of the most interesting movies to come out at the end of the 20th century was The Matrix, which basically the plot surrounded, you know, the idea that the world that we're living in is an illusion and we're just being used by some great mechanical overlords to sap us of our electrical energy. And I thought about that when I was watching this debate between this ex-Christian Matt De La Honte and Jordan Peterson and De La Honte was a materialist basically saying, you know, all we are is our materiality and Jordan Peterson coming after him as kind of a phenomenological approach that says, you know, we can't be sure that, you know, this materiality is exactly the real world we're living in and so all we're left is consciousness. And in a sense, you know, that is living in the moment. My life is one moment to the next and it's a special kind of life. It's not like the illusion of The Matrix where some computer is pumping this into me because every given moment leaves a layer, a material layer, a relational layer, a layer within layers we don't even understand. And so this, you know, I've been wrapping my head around, you know, what is a human being and certainly we are material creatures but we are material creatures traveling through moments through time every action decision thought creates a material relational past and that past then you know goes back and creates this moment and then the moment begets the future and the past and so here we are traveling through life and this begins I think about the psalmist you knit me together in my mother's womb and you know from a perspective of the Bible you know we travel through this we are this kind of creature ever at every moment being in being made new yet always connected to our past yet leaning forward into the future and so are we material creatures? Well I'm kind of the same material creature I was but you know we look at a photograph of me in high school maybe I should put one in here. You know, you know we're these strange creatures we think of ourselves materially but that little one year old that my great grandmother was holding with my young father is the same person as this me here graduating from high school with kind of blondish hair that's just getting curly and so we are me and those are all me and all of those me's are connected and so we are these material beings traveling through moments in time and again each decision in each moment makes a you know changes the me and this new me then goes into the future but it's connected to all of those old me's and how is it connected and how does that work you know we don't really know we're mysteries to ourselves and we have all of these layers there's the relational layer between everything physical and between the creator and the creation and the physical layer itself and the existential moment and we're made to live in all of these at the same time and then death comes and this is you know this is when my father died and here's my uncle who's you know you can never sit still and the grave diggers had already dug the hole and so he you know picks up the picks up the plywood to check out the hole and I caught I saw this picture when I was looking for pictures for the sermon and I thought well here we are because you know what's after the grave we you know we want to peek do our do our moments stop does the does the body just decay what happens to us and and actually this is a this is a long long conversation and and this morning we're going to read something from the book of Corinthians and and Corinth was this you know that this was the second life of this city it had been it was a Greek city and it had been destroyed by the Romans and the Romans left it fallow for a hundred years and then the Romans rebuilt it basically because geographically it was in a place that that a city made sense and it was in the nexus of you know important nexus of the empire and it was a seaport and it was it was wealthy and it was cosmopolitan there weren't that many Jews in it and so the the early church that that grew in in in Corinth was was cosmopolitan and chaotic and and when Paul writes there he's there there are dramatic church and he loves the church and they're simultaneously saints and horrible sinners and and so Paul spends two letters working on his very difficult relationship with this church you know trying to figure out what the what the Corinthians thought about death I think NT Wright in his book the resurrection of the son of God says it well if Homer functioned as the Old Testament for the Hellenistic world then by the first century included the entire Middle East its New Testament was unquestionably Homer our our Plato for Homer you know what people anticipated after life was the dismal dark underground Hades where maybe there was some differentiation between the good and the bad but but their death was a one-way street you go down to the depths and there you're locked in forever dead people don't rise but now now Homer had a different idea he had a different worldview and he imagined that we were these you know pre-existent spirits that are in some ways caught within bodies and so after death you know good people at least would would fly to the sky and be up in the sky and now and now you can you can see how much how much Platonism has gotten into Christianity and kind of this common American idea of of what happens after death if I did another Google search on on you know life after death you'd see clouds and disembodied people and floating around kind of all up there in the sky and and so these these cultures are through that so death in the first century Corinth imprisoned souls in Hades which was Homer's Old Testament or pre-existent souls of the good liberated to the timeless decay decay free heavens in Plato the souls of bad men to torment or recycled to another body of lower status so you know there's there's a fair amount of diversity in this and so one of the there were ideas of re of reincarnation in that part of the world too but and so if you were good you know you might go up to the heavens and escape escape the body but if you were bad you're recycled down here and if you are man you might come back as a woman because the idea was that was a lower status or or even an animal and then Paul writes to Corinth now brothers and sisters I want to remind you of the gospel I preach to you which you received and on which you have taken your stand by this gospel you are saved if you hold firmly to the word I preach to you otherwise you have believed in vain now those of you who know me know that if you're in a Sunday school class or a Bible study with me and and you just throw out this world word saved I'm going to stop you and ask you to define it because there's so many different there's so much Christian code talk that goes on and everybody's supposed to understand the language and then what happens is the code talk replaces the language and nobody actually talks about it and so the question here for for Paul is by this gospel you have been saved and and you have to ask well saved from what and and if you do any study of what the word saved in the Bible means that it's it's a the word's got a broad lexical range which means that it can be used in many different situations and I think that's exactly right because you know saved from what and I think saved from everything well which layer of me saved my body or my moments or my identity or my memory or my psyche my personhood or or what exactly are you talking about my soul and and I think basically the best way to think about this is is is kind of what Rose says of Jack in Titanic but in a much richer fuller world you know saved in every way I can be saved now that's a that's a tall order but I don't think Paul is talking about anything less than that you know we did I did a I did a conversation with with three other gentlemen about an overture and we were talking about politics and and and the church and and the the the guy in the lower left hand corner here who who who started this overture to senate I mean his frustration was that that what he saw going on in the church was a a bifurcation a split in the church of of people who you know think well you know the church should all be about rescuing things down here below and others saying no we're not going to get into politics we we just want to stay pure and and go up to the heavens in kind of a platonic way and and so you know what happens so often in Christianity saved can get reduced to a pleasant after-death experience and and this gets this gets changed and corrupted and in all kinds of different ways and you know one one of the things that I've you know I often try to remind people is that there's actually a structure to the story of the Bible and and while this is a this is obviously a representation and part of the reason I I just use little lines here is to keep us remembering that's it that it's a a representation but basically the story is one of heaven and earth being cut off and the big story of the Bible is not you know heaven and hell the big story of the Bible is the question can heaven and earth be reconciled and what will that mean and it's within this context that that Jesus Christ dies on the cross as a sacrifice and he's risen from the grave as a vindication of the sacrifice and the inauguration of the resurrection of the dead which the Jews at this point were believing in and which Paul in fact was preaching and he's going to talk about that in the moment so Jesus is raised from the dead and his resurrection is seen as the first fruits of our resurrection and he ascends up into heaven and he sends down his holy spirit and the end of the story is when the divorce between heaven and earth is finally overcome and Jesus' prayer in the Sermon on the Mount, by kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven, is finally fully realized as well as as all of Jesus preaching about the kingdom of heaven and the kingdom of God and Paul talking about being in Christ and John talking about eternal life and and seen through the lens of the Old Testament finally the fulfillment of the promise of Israel coming into this world. That is the story of the Bible and and it is not a story about a world out there as I talked about in a previous lesson where I brought in the Heideberg Catechism that me even me individually who is traveling through all of these moments as a as a as a material being through time a living nephesh as the Old Testament calls me that that this even has to do with me and so Paul comes to the church of Corinth and says you're forgetting the gospel this is the key to everything and I and I think so often what we do in the church is we diminish this to oh this is we're going to heaven when you die uh yeah the Lord will not abandon you to the grave but that's not the end of the story the end of the story is the resurrection where in fact this this type of being continues its in continuity but it as we see in the resurrected body of Jesus it is glorified and the rebellion of nature against us and the perpetual war between us and nature that gets reconciled and and it all comes together and so this is what Paul is talking about in 1st Corinthians 15 and right here actually we have probably the most important resurrection account if you look at those scholars today who are debating the historicity of the resurrection this is the one it all comes down to for what I received I passed on to you as of first importance that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures that he was buried and that he was raised on the third day according to the scriptures and and now notice how Paul keeps tying that back to the scriptures and remember from the previous sermons in this series that that Jesus you know points to this in almost every case this is the fulfillment of the scriptures old and new testament are pulled together here and that he appeared to Cephas who is Peter and then to the 12 and after that he appeared to more than 500 of the brothers and sisters at the same time and so he's saying this is not a conspiracy most of whom are still living though some have fallen asleep Paul is is making this comment you know maybe 20 years or so after the resurrection and Paul is saying you can go back to Jerusalem and you can go back and find people who saw the resurrected Jesus this is something that we experienced in this normal space and time even though as we've talked about in the last videos it is not something that the people could comprehend and well I'm going to drop another thing into this one of my all-time favorite videos is is Gary Habermas with his walking through the the the the resurrection argument that has changed a generation of scholars that he did for the Veritas forum at at University of Santa Barbara where he talks about we know who Paul is we know the date of this letter we know the people he's talking about you know this this is a this is a documentary path that leads all the way back to to living witnesses who saw him I oh no I got another thing I got to pop in here there's this video being passed around pastors called godspeed and in in this video there's a there's a guy who uh likes to run around either in his kilt or naked in the woods um it's kind of interesting story but he he talks about the fact that he started getting interested in the bible when the when the pastor showed him a map and and he realized that the um that the people in the small community you know were not going to be have the wool the the you know have the basically get hoodwinked by by a fake story that in in small communities people know the real deal and if someone's making up stories about doing miracles it's it's going to be debunked quickly and and so this is part of the reason he he grows to start to believe this stuff and Paul says 500 people have seen him and you can you can go and find these people and ask them and talk about this and they will tell you that this is true but if it is preached that christ has been raised from the dead how can some of you say that there is no resurrection from the dead now now this is really interesting because paul kind of reverses it because in in some ways people might be saying well you know weird things happen in life maybe this you know something weird happened and so this jesus showed up again and people made a big deal about it so far so on you know so so what what doesn't matter maybe there's a one-off fluke but but this doesn't happen and paul kind of switches it around and says you should be believing in the resurrection from the dead well what do you mean by that because again according to homer uh the the way down into the earth is a one-way street and according to playdo no one would want to come back and so why on earth are you talking about the resurrection of the dead and why are you saying in jesus this has begun if there is no resurrection of the from of the dead then not even christ has been raised and if christ has not been raised our preaching is useless and so is your faith more than that we are then found to be false witnesses about god for we have testified about god that he raised christ from the dead but he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised for if the dead are not raised and christ has not been raised either in other words paul puts the same argument that christ has been raised and the general resurrection of the dead is one thing the only thing it's separated by is time and if christ has not been raised then your faith is futile and you are still in your sins now remember back to all those other resurrection accounts and how often forgiveness of sins comes up and we talked about how you know one way of seeing forgiveness of sins is is kind of being released from a mental debt and that's the primary way we usually think about it but but if you actually look at both of those words they're both quite a bit broader and and sin is missing the mark and and and forgiveness is really a another way of saying released i mean this is released from missing the mark this is released from all of the the the mark missing that we live in the midst of the mark missing that we live in the midst of all the time in fact this resurrection of the dead is a lot more than just releasing each other from guilt and mental debts and debt lists that we are compiling in each other in our heads against each other this is this is the recreation of heaven and earth nothing less than those also have fallen asleep in christ or lost therefore those who have died oh well you know wait wait wait i'm a i'm platonic aren't they up there with the forms and the never decaying floating there and in some kind of happy consciousness and paul says no they're lost too if if christ wasn't raised if the resurrection from the dead isn't true then this entire enterprise that i've given my life to is foolish and you all are just stuck between homer and playdoh that's what he's saying to corinth now we obviously are are stuck in homer and playdoh and all the other kinds of things that we have floating around us today if only for this life we have hope in christ we are of all people most to be pitied and this is where paul says kind of echoes what a lot of people say well i think i think christianity helps me feel happy and paul says okay but that is such a loss and such a reduction then then you ought to be seriously pitied because all of the stuff and paul could say this about himself all of the sacrifice that i've done all of the all of what it has cost me to take this painful transition to being a persecutor of the church to now being a proponent of the church is simply utter loss and foolishness and and all of this sacrificial joy that you have invested in the gospel which you know you know living for your neighbors forgiving forgiving the sins of others um you know doing things that that you wouldn't want to do and that are considered unnatural to do by by general rules of of plain self-interest all of this is for nothing everything is tied on the resurrection of the dead and and don't forget it but christ has indeed been raised from the dead the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep and here paul reaches back into the old testament and and picks up this idea of first fruits when while everyone is waiting for the harvest to come in and their their stores of grain and food are running low the the the people of israel are called to bring their first harvest and give that to god as a statement of thanks and trust and an expression of trust that the rest of the harvest will come and so paul says this is what the resurrection of jesus means he is the first fruits of our resurrection and we say well well how can we know we will be raised from the dead and paul points at christ and says he is how you know well what will our resurrection be like he is what it will be like well well well what will we be like he is what we will be like and and this is designed to energize the disciples to live radically different lives here and now you see it isn't a competition between life after this life and this life now it's a continuity that says the shape of this life impacts that life to come and the hope of the life to come allows us the kind of radical discipleship and crossbearing that jesus lived and and that's why he again is our model that's why that's why he again goes before us he is the older brother he is the first fruits for since death came through a man the resurrection of the dead also comes through a man for as an atom all die so in christ all have been made alive but each in turn christ the first fruits then when he comes those belong to him then the end will come when he hands over the kingdom to to god the father after he has destroyed all dominion authority and power and i'm not going to get too deeply into this but this is a broad categorization basically after after the work is complete and we are ready to celebrate and be released from all of our sins into the goodness and glory that god has intended for us for he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet the last enemy to be destroyed is death for he has put everything under his feet now when he says that everything is put under him it is clear that this does not include god himself but put um who put everything under christ when he has done this then the son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him so that god may be all in all and and we are doing here layers of talking this is the renewal of heaven and earth this is the forgiveness or the release of sin and missing the mark this is the resurrection of the dead this is the undoing of the rebellion and ever every level this is the this is the great story of creation rebellion redemption restoration and and in a sense paul is paul is saying you know we have to look at the grave we have to understand the role the grave plays in this and and and we are drawn to it but but by the resurrection we are drawn beyond it and and the grave is in that way transcended and the grave is in that way temporarily marginalized and the grave will in a sense well the grave will in the future be defeated and god will be all in all and this is our hope how do we live this out no i didn't put misery deliverance gratitude in here maybe i still will i don't know how do we live this out well we live this out in the bread of new life because on the night he was betrayed by one of his friends and abandoned by the rest of them he took bread and he broke it and he said this is my body broken for you do this in remembrance of me and and the do this in remembrance of me and and the this he welcomes us into is the whole this of his life the the this of his life that that our entire selves this this material being living through these moments of time which which will not be finally destroyed by death separated from the body temporarily but in the resurrection renewed remade made whole and so we see in his we see in this meal we see the sacrifice the sacrifice of the body the sacrifice of his blood that the essential nature of this and we take this in and it becomes part of us and and we now then walk through his drama with him moment by moment flesh and blood being in time in this world and the next amen
