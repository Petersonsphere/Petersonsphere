 Hi, this is Paul. I wanted to do a video on why is everything becoming unglued? People are becoming unglued. Now obviously the answers, the protests, too much social media, too much news, too much virtual drama, but I wanted to have a little bit of an overview video and talk about this. I haven't put out a lot of monologue videos recently. I've been busy with my day job and I've been... usually when I have a hard time, I wanted to put out a video yesterday afternoon and I actually recorded some and threw it away. It's because I've got too many things going on in my head and I can't sort them out into even something coherent for me, which isn't always that terribly coherent to scatter shot and unfocused. But in conversations with regular people, regular people meaning people in my church, people in my community, people that I talk to as individuals on the channel, there is a high degree of stress right now. There's a high degree of anxiety and when this kind of stuff happens, people naturally want to take action to resolve it. The difficulty is that there's not necessarily relationship between the action they take and a better future. Some people are taking action with drinking or doing more pot or watching more Netflix. Some people are taking action by going out into the street with signs and yelling. Some people are taking action taking it out on their spouses or their dogs. Some people are taking action drowning it in their work. This is a meaning crisis and some and so I wanted to go through some of what I've learned over the last couple of years and maybe give you a few things that might help. Rebel Wisdom is doing a lot of things on sense-making and when they first started talking about sense-making, I didn't connect with the term very well. Of course I heard the term from Eric Weinstein and his IDW stuff and so you know I had a sense of the term. One of the things that I'm you know really paying attention to is how I usually use the word fudgy but also how sloshy words are. We use these words when we've got a grip on 30% of it, the rest is sort of spilling all over the place when we use the words. So what is the sense-making that Rebel Wisdom says we need so badly and now I listen to and watch a lot of their videos and I enjoy them. I very much appreciate and benefit from the work that they're doing but the sense-making thing didn't really connect with me. What do you mean by this sense-making? Now I want to go through a little bit of stuff and this is a lot of my stuff and some stuff I've learned from Vervecky and Peterson and stuff I thought about beforehand. Our earliest sense-making activity is story and early on Benjamin Boyce had a really good conversation with John Vervecky about story and us and as I've mentioned in previous videos before any of this happened and I was wrestling with the question of what is Christianity and we have these stories in this book and you have Jesus resurrection and I remember people saying to me things like okay conservative Protestant what if Jesus rose from the dead two thousand years ago so what what does that have to do with my life and it forced me to think a lot about what Christianity is and the Christian story and how that fits together and before all of this I came to the conclusion that and you've heard it me say it many times people are see it again language gets difficult people are stories now they're not just stories but you know in a sense they're gonna pick hard to find a guy to pick hard well okay this is this is historical this is history is the story in the book no the story is not in the book where is the story the book is representing the story the book is conveying the story but the story is in the book and what is the story and and what was Martin Luther King jr. I thought about this when I was thinking about the resurrection because I was thinking okay well let's say you know poop poop that's not the right word pop I'm in the right but I'm in a I mean I'm in a new body but what am I and and and I'm the story and I thought about the fact that well the story I tell about myself well there's multiple aspects to it and sometimes when I'm with different people I tell and I see myself in different light the my wife sees me differently than I see myself my kids see me differently than my wife sees me and I see myself my congregation sees me differently and and I thought this through and I said basically what you need is God only only I think God's not a thing only God can see all of me because part of me is the story that goes from Stan and Barb and back through history into my ancestors and there's genetics at work and there's culture at work and and and the the thing that is myself as an individual if I can be conceived that way because to what degree am I not my father or my grandfather or not and on and I'm on this I'm this story but I'm I'm a story that's and again that the cognitive science I'm a story that's embodied and and I'm I'm embodied to a far higher degree than this the story of dr. King and bearing the crosses embodied in this book so so I'm a story and now John Vervecki pointed out and has pointed out to me a couple of times and it's he's exactly right that this this this this story capacity this psychotechnology as he would say that we have isn't well it's it's it we come up into it our memory making capacity seems connected to our story making capacity and in fact we store many memories in this narrative so there's a a marriage and family psychologist in my church that does a lot of EMDR with the lights and and and so if you read the body keeps the score you read about how traumatic memories are not integrated properly into the story somehow and that causes problems and so looking at these flashing lights and talking about the story somehow rewires the mind and so the story that is me is is somehow built into this body the story that is me and my food preferences and my and my habits and everything gets built into this body and and it gets expressed in this office and so it's it's me but it's not just me and it's connected and it's this it's this astounding thing what a human being is but it's but but we can't understand it and in a sense our native language for all of this is story so so consciousness obviously affords live experiences my dog has consciousness but to the best of our knowledge my dog even though my dog clearly has memory but my dog does not have the same kind of story capacity that I have now now one of the one of the amazing capacities of story is future and and you might say that that story affords us past and future and and and in this way story sort of affords us future future sight because if we look on our past as story we can kind of turn around and look to our future as story and so this story capacity is very important and very integral to who we are and you know as Jordan Peterson noted with the lobsters and our and our systems and again this is a layman's guide I don't know this stuff I'm not a psychologist I'm not a cognitive scientist I'm just listening to these people and these these people like John Verbeke and Jordan Peterson and and Jonathan Haidt they're telling me things that that that I can never hope to know to the level that they know but they obviously think it's important that I grasp it at some point and somehow it'll improve my life okay and and I take them at their word and I take them as as trustworthy and reliable people who are who are not being who are not telling me a tale or lying to me and and we are all practicing this and in good faith one to another and we're trying to figure out this wild mystery we call a life and so we use models like like story and like all our scientific models to try and integrate this into a cohesive whole for the sake of what and even then we're not clear on for goodness or health or beauty or truth or something moving forward and so this is this is what we're we're piecing together and putting together now our narratives likely start quite small and probably quite disconnected but the older we go and the more we live and the more we learn and the more we develop they become more cohesive but they're also deeply formed by our childhood quite obviously and so here's a picture of of Northside Chapel in Patterson New Jersey that I used in my my video about race and and so you know I've got not only have do I have Stan and me in terms of my DNA but I've got Stan and me in terms of watching him and I've got my mother and me in terms of my DNA and my mother and me in terms of watching and shaping and forming and all of that and and you know consciousness affords we have these emotional realities and experiential data and we're constantly taking this in and it's by no means all passing through the the consciousness layer we're just taking it in massively all the time and and and at levels where we're by no means conscious of and that is forming and developing us into these amazing wonderfully wonderful powerful things that we call human beings but but along with this come all of the biases that we have because we need the biases because the world is too big and so we translate things down into as Jordan Peterson said to Roger Scruton these little cartoons and and we hold them and if you look at my conversation with I can't remember his name right off the bat the musician from upstate New York from Albany please forgive me for for not coming up with your name this quick but he said you know I work with these musicians and they carry around these snapshots and and and and and they're living out of these snapshots and this connected me very much with the MDR conversation about yeah these traumatic snapshots and we we live out of them and you know once bit twice shy and and all of these things that we're doing and so this is a this is an astounding process that we're living through and working through and molding us and forming us and then and then Barbara and I think can't think of her name Aaron she wrote nickel and dimes and she wrote it wasn't a wild and crazy God you guys will clean it up in the comment section Barbara Ehrenreich wrote this fascinating book about her her mystical experiences that she has and she's a you know she's a she's a stone-cold atheist and and it's a book about God and she doesn't believe in God and this reminds me of Chesterton's quote about mysticism that you know laypeople both both you know believe in God and doubt God and and and all of this crazy thing that it means to be it but but anyway what did she talk about in that book she talked about oh yeah it's the you know it's not the people you know people when people are talking to me they're talking to their parents and they're talking to their siblings and they're talking to their enemies and they're talking to their friends in other words we're all these little low-resolution pictures with each other and I was going to comment on a and some of the negative comments that I get on YouTube but I don't get I don't get very many of them which I'm not sure is always good but but whenever you get a comment like that it's very clear that the story they have of me is not the story I have about myself and and often in this social media world the story they imagine me to be to be is based on just one or two data points and and I have to apologize to the world because I do this to all of you too that the first time there's an impression of you there's this data download that's coming in and and it's being checked against all of my past situations and and and interactions and relationships and all of that and if if you like me had a stable household and wonderful generous faithful parents and surrounded by a loving and and robust community of of care and concern and well-being not perfect but but if you grew up with many of the blessings I grew up with it now suddenly I have an affordance of trust and an affordance of transparency because I see people who grew up with quite a bit less than that they're skittish and they're defensive and they're they're suspicious and all of those things got built in very early and of course there's there's genetics in there and and there's wiring as Jonathan Haidt talks about in the happiness hypothesis and all of this and we're all of these things each one of us individually and we come into this world and this and this amazing interaction doesn't stop but of course the foundational childhood ones are are critical and and and often they can be surmounted and and gotten past but but many many people don't get past them and then eventually identities form and as our stories grow we have to take on certain roles the role of a son the role of a worker the role of a student the role of a Christian when confronted with non-christians the role of this the role of that the role of this and identities form okay identities form from from some incidental things are seemingly and since that from the from the amount of pigment in my skin by the amount of height that I received from my father by whether or not my eyes work well enough to to that I don't need glasses by the the accent that I have being from New Jersey there's not much of one because my parents were from different places and again that the astounding complexity and myriad of things that come in and and then we have all these identities that we don't even know we have so as our stories grow we become more aware that we are players in these stories in relationship with others and there are aspects to our characters we become increasingly aware of and an agency grows as we become we very soon begin to know that we can shape our identities and we can take on identities that we didn't have before and if our story is going in a way that we don't prefer maybe we can move our story in another way and this starts from a very young age from when we learn the word no and when we hear and see that our parents are responsive to our cries or unresponsive to our cries and so we find other ways and so we're we find our agency and so we're these story shapers and and so we're not only stories which to us feel sort of passive but but the stories themselves take on agency and so we're these are just these amazing amazing creatures and and then and then our stories become tools and we learn how to lie and we learn what the truth is and we learn to to say the particular way that gets an outcome and we learn to take on an identity that gets an outcome that we like and remember from my racism videos we did we see meaning before we see the other resolutions we see opportunities and obstacles and and so we're we're constantly doing this and we're doing this in ways that we have no idea that we know that we're doing it and our stories get increasingly communal we begin to see aspects and groups and institutions as agents and characters and we talk that way incessantly and and and and listen to the agency and so we're we're we're suddenly we're part of tribes and and my identity and my tribe start to coalesce and we realize that that we have duties and responsibilities and opportunities within tribes and so now suddenly where we're defensive because we're defending our tribe or we're aggressive because we're taking on new territory and and we cooperate with others in our tribe in order to compete and our tribes are elastic and they move around and sometimes I'm part of this tribe and sometimes a part of that tribe often depending on where I'm standing and who I'm standing with and who I'm talking to and and whether I see the situation as as an opportunity or an obstacle and so communally all this stuff is being built in and again we're doing all of this stuff and we don't even know it we practice it when we're playing sports teams or playing board games or when we're we figure out that we're the teachers pet or or the teacher hates us or we're the smart kids in class or the dumb kids in class or we're the obedient compliant kids in class or the rebellious kids in class and on and on and on and on and on and on these things go and then we get these ideas of just listen to healthy and not healthy and so we stick with our tribes until something changes it might be a plausibility structure it might be a traumatic event it might be a new narrative opportunity for us to take on a new identity because we think that there'll be more opportunity with this new identity or maybe we took on a new identity and then we're being shaped and shaped and shaped by a new community in a new context and new books we're reading and new movies we're watching and so suddenly we discover I'm a different person than I was five years ago I didn't try to be but now suddenly I am and now even some of the longest deepest elements of our identity gets shaped and there's a transformation and the transformation can be pleasant and exhilarating or it can be painful and laborious and these narratives we soon discover seem to have lives of their own and and we're always evaluating them is this healthy is this not healthy is this good is this not good and we're using the narratives to evaluate it yeah you know Homer drinking the mayonnaise and the vodka and March says Homer that's not a good idea that's for tomorrow's Homer well if Homer knows narrative yeah he'll be tomorrow's Homer tomorrow these narratives are interconnected at levels of at levels and with technologies human beings haven't seen now and if no wonder people are feeling unglued you know we look at a statue and say it's just a statue no it's not just a statue well we look at the statue and say well if you know anything about Andrew Jackson well he was pivotable in the war of 1812 beating the British he also had was pivotal in some in some pretty brutal interchanges with with those brought over from Africa and those who were already in the Americas when the Europeans came just you know there's plenty of literature out there written about Andrew Jackson colorful character why do we esteem him well we esteemed him because he helped our tribe win against a far England was a world power in the United States was woefully unprepared and lost a war to Canada I mean think about that well Canada wasn't Canada but you know look at the celebrations of the war of 1812 in Canada compared to the United States and even after the the peace was made but the news didn't get there so the Battle of New Orleans you know old hickory came through and helped our tribe win now to what degree do we participate in that narrative and so if as has been going on now you reconstruct the narrative to have different values and different elements and you locate that narrative in a different place well Andrew Jackson looks different and the statue on the Washington Mall Justin not very far from the White House well there you have it and so ropes tied to this statue depending on where you are in the narrative how you've been formed yeah this is unsettling why was it when the US invaded Iraq that all the statues got knocked down and people took their shoe and pounded it on Saddam's statue symbolism happens I mean the symbolism that Jonathan Peugeot talks about this isn't this isn't just happenstance this is stuff built deeply into it how do you feel when you see a flag burned do you say yeah let it burn depends on which flag right depends on how you feel about your tribe right one year you might feel one way another year you might feel another depends on the transformation you've been through so sense-making is really narrative work what's going on how can I predict the future and show some agency in my own narrative to to hopefully get myself in a position to receive a future that I want when the world is such chaos when the economy is uncertain and Kovac is still around and well I thought we were talking about police brutality but now we're pulling down statues what's going on and is the government going to stop them sometimes the government seems to just stand there and I think about I think about the fall of the Soviet Union a lot of governments a lot of countries transform because they get to the point of saying what we got just isn't worth it let it burn well this is what we're facing we don't know what's coming down the road Brett Weinstein in his conversation with John McWhorter says you know I'm seriously worried John McWhorter's like well it all depends on the level of the fever it seems between the two of them John McWhorter well this is gonna heat up and people are gonna start making more sense and it'll cool down again and things will get back to normal Brett Weinstein isn't so sure I don't know I don't know and then I see the video of the woman who purportedly gave this guy the finger and followed him or something and so he followed her back to her apartment and put the video camera on her while she freaked the heck out and I remember the video of the the college professor trying to talk reasonably to the other students at Yale this wasn't this wasn't evergreen which this is Yale these are this college you know was looking to get the cream of the crop of the various crops and have them there and and when I when I watched this woman and when I listen to those students I hear pain in their voice now it's it's easy and it's dismissive to call them snowflakes but as a pastor part of me knows even I'm gonna get in trouble with this word not well justified pain is still pain so what do the people need and and most people we don't want to feel pain some people do dramatize things because it gets them attention and you know there's a lot of we we we have lots of stupid human tricks that we play in each other for all kinds of manipulative reasons but on one hand I might not find be in agreement with the stories that these individuals are telling themselves and the existential threats they feel but I've as a pastor been with plenty of people who freak out over things that I look at and say you're okay but yet their emotional response is real and so how generally speaking do you help such people slap across the face I haven't done that there have been times when I've been very direct if I've had an opportunity and I thought that a very direct loud approach would snap them out of it most of the time it's listening taking a step back sensitively asking questions probing a little bit because to change someone's perspective is to change their story and and again this isn't just this isn't just like the nature of this story in the book this is deeply built into us and so you know we talk about pressing people's buttons and if you know someone well if you're married to someone or if they're your kids or if they're your parents you know just what to say to trigger them emotionally and there's a whole lot of people in this world that are covered with buttons and they're on hair triggers and I'm afraid as a society part of this amazing society that we've built with air conditioning and automobiles and and delicious foods and entertainment and all of these things that we've built for us it's also a society that has really built people who are not hardy or solid or non-reactive people already have serious issues with reactivity and that book the secret of our success talked about and other places too talked about you know part of what sets us apart from chimpanzees is chimpanzees are enormously reactive that's why they're also enormously strong that's why they make terrible pets my dog is is is more reactive than a human being but I can lend him some of my non-reactivity it seems and and settle the pooch down well we've sort of made and social media I think has a big part of this we have sort of made reactivity something that we reinforce and you know I'll have to take part of the blame for it my own videos there in some ways reactive I started making videos by reacting to Jordan Peterson's work now now again like many many things reacting isn't in itself a bad thing within measure within context in good faith we react inside we react outside if our trigger if we don't have a good handle on the trigger we don't have good resistance to reactivity well we get ourselves in trouble and many of the people I work with who are homeless or substance abusers who struggle with what we call mental illness who have a variety of relational problems even successful people so much of it is as the book of James says can't control the tongue we react we talk first and think later and this does a tremendous amount of damage Jonathan height in the coddling of the American mind narratives are communally created and maintained and we've been molding expectations via movies and advertising literature and news and these are enormously powerful tools and we spend hours and hours a day in front of them and that's even before social media which is far more addictive because you know who the light gives me this little dopamine hit and and on and on and on and on and schools have been doing this intentionally in churches do this intentionally and and word and parents do this intentionally and governments do this intentionally we all do this again and again and again but the the way in which we shape these things is vitally important and of course Jonathan height talks about the fact that in a way we've set kids up he talks about one side of it can't remember if he talked about the other side much but I've seen the double side on one hand we we teach children to always defer to a therapeutic authority who's going to make everything therapeutically well for them and on the other hand we listen to Steve Jobs and kind of this American rebellious don't trust authority and and so it's tremendously ironic that of course I went to Christian school and so the kind of commencement addresses we'd hear in Christian school would say things like serve the Lord the kind of commencement addresses you hear out of public education are go out in the world and change it well when I look at people in the street I think they listen to the commencement address don't listen to authority you know travel your own path but most people out there look a lot more like non-player characters out there they're all traveling their own path all together in the herd and and and so we gave them these two ideas we told them submit to authority and comply schools give that idea very strongly and then the other idea don't listen to authority blaze a new trail and it's like well there you go and so now young people are in a double bind they've been told blaze your own trail and don't listen to authority and defer to authority well which is it and when you listen to the messages being given hear all the the collisions and inconsistencies of the conflict of those messages the world people live in our product of the stories and the images presented to them as well as their personal experiences I for a long time I thought about what does it mean that we watch these these TV commercials and we see these billboards and and and we're just we're just one product away from Nirvana all the time this is insane the world we've created for human beings and when you you look at it in contrast to let's say a world 200 years ago that people lived in when you were a you were a young person you were very quickly given responsibility around the house or around the farm and if you didn't hold up your end of the responsibility the whole family would suffer and they would enforce that too and and the dominant environment you lived in perhaps it was perhaps it was urban but just a small number of human beings lived in urban areas most people lived in rural areas and it was farming and so over the last couple of hundred years with urbanization we've radically changed human beings and what we eat and how we live and and we've we've molded and we've shaped this world and and and so now this has just been changing dramatically with with the advent of electronic communication and mass media and then social media and and and you know diversity is our highest goal well you keep flooding people they're just trying to figure out what african-americans are like and now now they find hispanics and they learn that well hispanics are well they might be mexican they might be Guatemalan they might be they might be from Spain they might be from Argentina and you're looking at vastly different cultures and now you're looking at Asians oh okay Asians and you and you recognize Chinese folks and Japanese culture and Korean culture and Vietnamese culture and Hmong culture well they're all different and and and and you just keep bombarding people with all of these differences and yeah you know you go to the Thai restaurant and you enjoy the Thai food but that's a whole different thing from living in a Thai village or sleeping in a Thai home well the food is tasty but you know even Chinese food almost nowhere you can go in the world not find Chinese food you talk to Chinese a lot of Chinese people that I've talked about and said yeah that's not what we eat in China same with Mexican food same with Thai food it's a product that they've labeled with their nation of origin so they have in a sense a marketing strategy and there's nothing wrong with it and living in a city like Sacramento where there's restaurants from all over the world is a delight and it's in a sense Isaiah 60 and the kingdom of God because the treasures of the world have come to Sacramento it can be bought at an affordable price even for a middle-class person who has a taste for different culinary diversity but all that we've done has has created a catastrophism in people and we reward it we reward people to we reward people to go out and say I'm afraid to go in the street well why because of a black man or a white man or an Asian man or an Asian woman I'm afraid to be around white women because white women are going to make up a story about me and I'll be lynched and now if you were living in the Jim Crow South it's a very real thing and I'm not about to say that all of those wounds are healed and all those triggers have gone away but it is not like it was when Emmett Till was lynched but it's different in every place when I grew up in Paterson the racism in Paterson was different from the racism in Grand Rapids Michigan was different from the racism in Santo Domingo was different from the racism in Badawana was different from the racism in Sacramento people are like that and and and we've created these narratives and and I'm afraid what we've done is just created tremendously fragile people who are ready to react and after COVID and everything people and things are becoming unglued and too often the way to keep people from keeping them from harming other people well the government's monopoly on the use of violence I mentioned that sometimes to my children and they'll be like what never heard of that oh why do police have guns well arms of the government they're supposed to have a monopoly on the use of violence so we don't have to and in some ways this is a this is a state ties version of vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord I will repay not you because when we're settling scores back with one another there is no justice and so sense-making this we figure out what is racism we don't understand the abstracted term but but it's all over the place and it's the same it's it's very much in many ways the same types of things particular histories but same types of things and we have these competitive definitions we have propositional racism and we have motivational racism and we have consequential racism and and we keep flipping those between each other and we see the consequences of racism and we blame people for and we say you're motivated well the system motivated systems certainly have motivations but how is that like human motivations and how isn't that like human motivations what is real and so in the modern period we say reality is known by statistics well please tell me what reality that is because that's a picture from nowhere and and whereas it can be a powerful tool when it comes to person when it comes to personhood if you're the one struck by lightning or bit by a shark or or if you're the one that was the was the victim of police brutality well it's not a statistics it's real and it's you you don't care about statistics personal experience is not a statistic in terms of narrative shaping power but it's real and so sense-making this is what we're trying to do now of course rebel wisdom has lots of theories and it's a YouTube channel and so it's not giving you personal experience and of course Dave and Ali do men's work and that's what they've done before and of course those that type of programming is more experiential and so they get into the kinds of things that the channel gets into but truth is listening to a video might inform your gray matter to one degree or another might help recalibrate some of the pictures might do some of that but there's physiology of reactivity that's very important because sometimes by virtue of the things that were built into you of course remember you see meaning first before this frontal lobe kicks in and so you react and then suddenly okay back that reaction down and so you know breathing techniques and count to ten and you know all these kinds of ideas about slow down slow the anger down don't don't just react don't just respond think take a day take a couple of days talk to a wise friend do all of these things just filling our heads with more stuff well that has its place but it's not all of it how much does theory actually impact our sense making now I'm a pastor and I talked to people for a living talk talk talk talk talk talk talk sermons talk talk talk talk talk talk talk or Protestants do a lot of listening people have to do their own talking do a lot of listening a lot of that talking most of it bounces off most of it bounces off it's repetition it's personal it's communal it's habitual it's a lot of the things that a lot of the programming that's being done to us by movies or TV or sports or church or I mean these are all the things that have quite a bit more power and of course what gets in first sort of has priority in terms of a human being and can take a long time to unlearn some of those programs as they're called of course I wouldn't be a pastor if I didn't talk about Christianity and I know we always hear about you know the the new atheists that the new atheism died the minute I saw everybody having secular worship services in the street woke worship services it's like this project of making people non-religious statistically didn't work and it's not working now and it's never going to work because of how we are wired we see low resolution we see through narratives narratives dominate when someone when someone says something that's not in alignment with a narrative I have I immediately reject it takes a long time for that thing or a traumatic experience or an insight or something for to change it that's why we call it pilling someone a blue pill or a red pill or or or a bread pill or a black pill or what have you because well we've gotten used to taking pills in order to to suddenly speed up the kinds of emotional things that that usually take years to develop so bo Weingart on Twitter I'm very open to the argument that Christianity is the best available totalizing narrative and that it's and its putative replacements have been a string of pseudo secular religions with deleterious consequences and Nathan Dickinson coder songs music grumpy says do you think it's possible that Christianity not the watered-down churchianity version is best because it best comports with reality and human nature because there's a there there because it's actually true that Jesus was real and was God incarnate there's a lot in that tweet Bo responds I think it's a view of human nature is largely correct but I don't accept its metaphysics and then of course Esther chimes in it's a powerful myth but I don't accept its metaphysics maybe you need to reconsider the total and totalizing that's the rest or Esther Esther Esther oh just something else post-modernity and narrative so here we are and post-modernity looked suspiciously at narratives but of course by virtue of the programming done to us when we were two or three this powerful programming we're not getting rid of narratives boys and girls you're just not being honest with them might as well be up front and say to the best of my knowledge because of course we don't see ourselves particularly well this is my narrative this is what I'm gonna live with and in the West the Christian foundational narrative is so strong and pervasive Rafe Kelly talked about my his father's bones you know riffing on Jordan Peterson but here's the thing there's been a ton of new data for the last 200 500 years and it's come so quickly that there hasn't been a sin that hasn't been assimilated or resolved and and and to figure that out pastors and theologians and communities at work on this continually and and I'm serious about all those three levels because all of these defections or deconstructions from Christianity are part of this process and so this is part of the reason I keep repeating Ephesians 612 to Christians we've battled not against flesh and blood which means that okay you're getting triggered by these people get your finger off the trigger and let's deal with the principalities and powers and I've noticed in just about all of my question and answer videos I'm getting the questions about angels and demons and that was a question that you know I had with Jonathan Peugeot early on and you know watches watches symbolism happens videos and you know I my the last two and a half years have been sort of like neo getting plugged into the back and I've had to think harder and faster than probably many times in my life before that cognitive science psychology young Nietzsche barfield and of course I've kept Lewis all along with me this whole time because I knew when I first saw Jordan Peterson and decided I would do a deep dive into him like I did into Tim Keller in the middle of the aughts I didn't have video then and I didn't do YouTube then so you didn't hear about me but if you search on my blog you'll find a ton of Tim Keller stuff and I listened to to dozens and dozens of his sermons and talks and I took that in and I knew when I started Jordan Peterson that I wanted in a sense a guide I wanted sort of I wanted a guide to walk with me through this and I wanted CS Lewis as that guide well how can CS be that guide he he died the year I was born well he left something of himself in this in his books and so I keep reading other things and I keep reading Lewis and I go back and forth and and I learned from Lewis and I learned how sometimes parts of Lewis are dated and I picked up new guides like Chesterton and he's been a helpful guide but he's a little harder for me to understand than Lewis and I found and I found personal friends and personal guides along the way you know to have the opportunity to talk with John Vervache and Rafe Kelly but also Job and Jeff and and Sherry and Shelley and and Cassidy and and and Luke can't forget Luke and and how many others on the discord server and and at the discord server to to create a community where there's there's Christians and non Christians and Sam the same always gets mentioned as the heretic well you need a heretic around so we got Sam and I think I think we got a great heretic because Sam is really skillful at conversations and his conversation with Brett Sockold was I thought a masterpiece and and in the kind of dialogo so some colonizing that John Vervache has done in me in terms of the kinds of conversations we need to have and and so all of that is my pro is my is my process in Christianity and then you know when I was doing a lot more Jordan Peterson stuff I'd get people that say why you're talking about Jordan Peterson why aren't you talking about Jesus well go on the church channel I talk about Jesus every week on the church channel a lot fewer subs there and some people say it's hard to find but the links always below in the notes I always go I always talk about Jesus on the church channel but it's I'm speaking within a tradition there and I'm sort of freewheeling out here on my own channel and a lot of people like the freewheeling so that's why I have two channels they're different elements of work but this is the kind of stuff Christianity must do and and of course it takes it takes a church it takes a massive village to do this because we need our hard-line our hard-liners and our fundamentalists and our and our high and openness people and the people who've gone off the rebel reservation in the wrong way and on and on and on maybe that's a racist term now going off the reservation and so my delight when I when I talk to Rafe Kelly and I know a lot of Christian people listening to that would they're like why are you why are you excited about this conversation well he's a great example that how Christianity I'm not sure about this I'm not sure about that I'm not sure about Revelation I'm not sure about any of this but agape boy that seems right and community that seems right so there's a lot going on there and and you know I asked myself how can Steven Pinker and Brett Weinstein again agree on modernity modernity is going away but my god but agape is sticking with us in some ways the generation in the streets have have never had it so good and so Steven Pinker has a point in other ways Brett Weinstein has a point um people are revolting until it costs them their cherished dreams and and this sort of keeps me going and catastrophizing along with Brett Weinstein sometimes because that's it's unfair to say what he does is catastrophizing but he's much more on the catastrophe side of things but again having lived what he lived and having experienced evergreen as he did and Benjamin Boyce too I can understand why they have the positions they have it's been built into them and it's good that we can talk and and for the most part the the commonality and agreement on agape is really important and so I'm thankful for that difficulty is though however when there's not a lot of agape in people's lives and they don't have structures that are agapic and they don't have relationships that are that are life-giving and love-sharing we're in the same shirt I wore when I made that video see the brain is so noisy I know I know meditation blah blah blah they'll go opioid with other white people whose dreams have never been fulfilled not only white people lots of people go opioid because soothes the chaos closes in the world shuts off the talking voices well it's hard to do with with mental energy and exertion and mental discipline it's easy to do with a pill or a smoke or a drug but it seems that the commitment to agape to agape to love is the highest value that's still out there pretty strong Tom Holland has a point and so I understand people and their exploration of a religion that isn't a religion and and Rafe in a response to a tweet that I made put another way despite the fact I'm convinced that the bones of the West derived from Christianity I do not believe in the Christian myth I wonder parts of it yes parts of it no not in the way I believe in the theory of evolution that's an interesting statement I think Jordan Peterson and John Vervecki offer potential means past this worse I don't think it's fully articulated I don't remember which one came before the other so I don't think it fully articulates that the enlightenment was or how it interrelates with religion my hesitation in seeing the answer is simply a return to Christendom is so far I do not see how the claims of revelation can be made congruent with scientific materialism I was going to do a should do a video just on revelation because if you're listening to modernist Christians talk about revelation you're going to hear it in a certain way okay and so it's helpful to think with ancient people and and don't just hear what people say about revelation watch what they do because I find that there's a lot of magical thinking when it comes to how people think they live if you tell me to do something I'll do it if I decide to do something I'll do it that's not how people see it's not how people think it's not how people live read Romans 7 but then Christianity is a mess and and I read this I read this thing that that went all over and I noticed Job did a little video and sent it to me since conservative and this this poor woman was complaining about the fact that others now there's ads pop into this so that's kind of interesting since the server of Christians keep coming at me here I'm a Christian and I believe proselytizing is violence against another oh violence got so schlock so so sloshy I'm a Christian and I believe LGBTQ plus people are divine and should lead us that's interesting I'm a Christian and I learned from people who do not share my faith well I don't find that to bearably unusual I gotta look at this bunion I'm a Christian and I don't go to church I'm a Christian I don't believe the Bible is the word of God I'm a Christian and I embrace sex positivity which includes but doesn't limited to sex outside of marriage I'm a Christian and I believe everyone has access to God everyone in all caps I'm a Christian and I do as I please which is not to say I can harm anyone that is never okay but the problem with this line of thinking is that once via once the word violence gets real sloshy well you're complaining about all the harm done by two others the people you're allied with or to you based on not even what people are saying to you but just what they're saying in general that's violence but here you imagine you can just post things on Twitter and not harm anyone there's a definite lack of coherence I'm a Christian and no Christianity has been used as a weapon of white supremacy for so long that any Christian who has an actively dismantling white supremacy is harming so what in you needs to be dismantled and you're harming and you don't even know it I'm a Christian I believe people know what's best for them except of course all those people who you labeled as white supremacists they don't know what's best for them according to you sometimes means running away from Christianity I applaud them after the amount of abuse I experienced inside of Christianity notice again the agency of these things because of toxic people and toxic theology they were harming you that's what you say but I thought people know what's best it's having one or two having a faith and however I wish okay or leaving faith altogether there's no that there is no third option I don't understand there's no going back to evangelism evangelicalism however you define that there's no embracing toxic theology again the word toxic is this proxy for healthy I understand it's fashionable it has some utility but it's pretty sloshy to be accepted there's no mental hoops to ignore oppression to run towards atheism as fast as possible if the condition to being a theist is that I have to embrace any type of toxicity or abuse if me saying I'm a Christian bothers you because I reframe concepts you were told are written in stone that's something you have to wrestle with in other words I get to be me tough on you but you'd better be very careful being you because you'll hurt me and it's like oh good grief this pattern of human interaction even just a good therapist should cure you of this Christianity or not Christianity because all you're covered with are buttons and you're pushing them out there in the world and you're posting it on Twitter Twitter is just one button after another if any identity I hold makes you uncomfortable that's on you well there's degree of truth to that quite a bit of truth to that that's really not something I have to fix that's true to that but that goes the other way too I have no responsibility to make you comfortable in my own space you put it on Twitter you're kind of in a communal space and you don't like people saying other things that you imagine make other people uncomfortable more so it's a victim of religious abuse I will not subject my now I'm a now she's a victim should have said she's a survivor that's the proper language I'm a survivor of religious abuse because victim is so victim ish survivor has victim plus strength I will not subject myself to retraumatization experiences better get off of Twitter or theologies to appease your discomfort okay you're not gonna find those on Twitter you may leave you may lie about me you may go on tirades about me as the devil I don't think she's the devil you may ignore me well stay off Twitter and don't want to even know about you you may not demand a thing of me I really don't you may not hurt me I will not allow it I'm not sure if that one works either because it sure sounds like you've been hurt and is that all your fault now this is my space this is my truth and this is how I teach others and their treat others and their spaces yeah you've definitely taught me something about how you treat others and again I'm gonna get no animosity towards this woman I don't even know who she is and apparently a bigger tweeter violating a Twitter etiquette reposted her tweets didn't like them called them Marxist he's got a big Twitter following she has a small one and she asked and I thought this was quite a good question would you be happier if I simply left Christianity well he probably would but you know you're quite right that's not his to decide you want to identify as a Christian and define that in your own way we all do that to one degree or another but the utility of these labels breaks down when in many ways language is a is property of the Commons and if we if we don't if we don't use it well together its utility breaks down and when human beings don't have the good utility of language between each other really bad things can happen so you know I I appreciate her text I'm glad she posted it I'm glad it got picked up someone sent it to me and I've seen other people reading it it's it's a contribution to the conversation and if she would like to come on my channel I'd love to have her on my channel and I will I will be as gentle with her as I am with atheists and people of just about every stripe out there I'll be just as gentle with her as I was with vows so who's a form of celebrity atheist a sexual anarchist of some sort so what isn't Christian in a sense Tom Collins Tom Holland asks Jordan Peterson says don't pay attention to these self-stuck labels they're of limited utility of some utility it's helpful in relating to okay you identify as a Christian that helps me that at least gives me a little bit of a platform maybe the Bible isn't the Word of God okay but you probably like Jesus so we can talk about Jesus and we can talk about what Jesus did and we can look at the little bit of data and now maybe you've shaped the data in a particular way so you get the outcomes you desire that may be but you know we work on that can't agree on what the labels mean that's a real problem we need an understanding of language that isn't as sloshy as what we're working with now we wield words at 50% accuracy and that's a real problem and we all do it and none of us can none of us can know the words perfectly and again one of Jordan Peterson's little rules very valuable you know try to use language with precision speak accurately it's a it's a growing edge for all of us Carl sent me this video which was very interesting by Brian Holdsworth and Brian went from evangelical to Roman Catholic and first he started talking about in this video about Protestants and reason and Aquinas and I found that quite interesting and I thought he made some good points and they talked about relevance and I thought well part of what we have to do is part of this part of this very messy reality that is Christianity now has everything to do with talking to one another and trying things out and searching things out and Christianity can have a lot of fads because it's very big but fads are fads and are proven and sometimes we find things that are helpful at least helpful maybe for a decade or a few centuries maybe a few centuries later they'll will be will recognize that they're a heresy and in my reading of Alistair McGrath's book heresy that this is a this is a dead end that Christianity ought not take because it unravels it but what we're doing now is is what Christians have always done and so we should be talking to the Muslims and the Jews and the various groups within Christianity and the various spinoffs like Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons and the religion that isn't a religion we should be talking to them we can learn from them if we watch language carefully we'll probably be able to I feel and this might surprise some of you and it's just as much a personal testimony as the woman whose tweet storm I just read I feel I have grown in faith since doing this YouTube enterprise I feel that interacting with with others have have made me more certain of Christ and his benefits towards me of the resurrected as the other resurrected Lord than I was before you live within a story and that story you believe hilarious tweet by Tom Holland this little historians it's a meme and so some of you are listening to this there's a woman and she's holding up a kid and bouncing this cherished little girl in a pool and the polls labeled World War two historians love World War two and there's the first World War just just just sinking and going under and then Tom Holland of course Tom Holland's brother is another historian about the Second World War which makes the tweets so funny and they're at the bottom of the pool Byzantine Sasanian War of 602 to 628 so of course I looked that up on Wikipedia because I didn't know much about it apart from reading Dominion and reading Tom Holland's book about Islam and Holland says in his tweet so true so unfair it's just a delicious delicious tweet but then you go to the historiography page and again you bump into what ancient historians deal with is that well why didn't those Persians keep records like the Greeks oh that shapes that changes that that that shapes the history we live in can science tell us the truth about the ancient war science is closing one eye and and limiting the variables and and dissecting it down who cares about it who cares about that war well we had grandpas that fought in World War one and World War two and it seems so close and so relevant so the relevance conversation makes a point too whoops wrong button so what do I do I've lived an enormously blessed life I have privileged to I don't find those two words are terribly interchangeable I don't think that's a good look out I have the blessings of age I've got fifty some years behind me and they've been good years some years hard but they've been good years my cake is mostly baked I'm not as plastic as I was before 25 blessings of cultivated trust part of the benefit of being a Christian for a long time is having it deep in me beneath my conscious self and then I noticed some Christians who deconstructed and there's a lot of Christianity left in them too just as Tom Holland notes there's a lot of Christianity left in the culture I've had I've and trust is a tremendous help in times of uncertainty and that's why people become more religious when things become unglued no atheists and foxholes not always true but the statement statement came about for a reason we look for someone to call on we look for someone to trust in when we realize we're in over our heads the blessings of community have been richly blessed by surrounded being surrounded by loving people who have my welfare and my well-being at heart not just my nuclear family but my church family I look at people and they don't go to church and I think yeah I understand church is complicated but if you can find a good church and a right church and a solid community it's a tremendous blessing people who will come alongside you will help you out will listen to you will help you out if you need a loan well you know if you have church deacons well you know we'll do all kinds of things for you well established available blessings of meaning I can resist finding meaning and ideology and and and and performative things out there in the public square to be seen by people and rest in a broader religious narrative that says you know chances are good by the time I get to the grave Jesus will not have returned and the world will still be a mess if not worse than today and many of the things that I have participated in and the people I've invested in by that point will be dead but I can say that I have not labored in vain because I believe that there is a God who honors the imperfect gifts that I give and in a life to come will make good on those investments store up for yourself treasure in heaven Jesus says where moth and rust don't consume where the age of decay doesn't eat it away so I've been I've been richly blessed here's a tweet that that I wrote I found Brett Weinstein's appearance on Joe Rogan quite interesting in an alignment I talked about politics a little bit which I shouldn't do I share some of the disappointments over the performance of the Democrats and the Obama administration for me that data point undermines his big fits which involves different getting different presidents elected I told people told you early on in my video career I'm a political skeptic but a religious believer certainly POTUS is an important thing but presidents come and presidents go the world is awfully big and the United States government is awfully big I thought David Fuller's video on the IDW and Jordan Peterson was very helpful I think he's right in believing that the way forward is not simply a return to modernism and science which Brett Weinstein and others like to wave like a flag science is a powerful tool but its power is in isolating variables and finding one key relevant factor that changes the game the challenges we face involve massive multivariable systems systems which develop agencies agencies that are superhuman their principalities what I hear from conceptual James and others is that classical liberalism but again there simply isn't any going back just Rafe and John Verbeke have a point there's not going back to past forms of Christianity as such even the orthodoxy practiced in America is not the orthodoxy practiced in Russia or Greece or Antioch things change we change we can't segment our lives now modulating that variable to be highly traditional I think that's very reasonable but nothing stays the same while there's sort of a well there's always a sort of going back and reclaiming a lost aspect the new comprehensive way forward also has new learnings and so this conversation between Rafe and John Verbeke was productive I thought I can see a growing appreciation for the integral aspect and hear me carefully here you know spiral is a clever way of integrating circular and progressive and yeah that any conversations that can't somehow any conversation that can't somehow recognize how it is the religious layer of the human stack that is the layer at which multiple variables are integrated is an understanding why iconoclasm is back you're not paying attention if you don't recognize that the conversation moving forward will be a feel will be theological in nature even if modernists can't recognize religion untagged from modernist conception of supernatural postmodernists have their own issues with narratives as I said these people having their holy moment they're gonna want it again they're gonna want another hit from religion I would recommend a fresh reading of the Sermon on the Mount and Jesus Plan A many of these virtual and in real life conversation partners dismiss efforts with Christian DNA because they say number one it's been tried and failed it's always failing I'm a failure two there's no time I recommend Tom Holland's book Dominion I do it all the time to recognize that our present moral structure is between competing elements within the Christian DNA often and there's no time we are surrounded by populations and institutions formed by this by this religious DNA I suggest that there's no time to remake the wheel figure out how to use the resources at hand that's my two cents
