 Hi, this is Paul and the Distributist has a channel on YouTube and I've spoken with him once and I, after watch he tagged me in this video on Twitter and after I watched it I told him I was going to call him the Destructivist because it's this, he does some stuff in his videos that really gets in my head and has me thinking in new ways and so he's a, you know, I really appreciate his insight whether I agree or disagree with him he really gets me thinking in some different ways and he did this video on Mencius Moldbug who I didn't really know anything about but it's someone that many who watch my channel will probably know something about. I was early, pretty early on, people told me that this was a channel I should watch and the main question was why does the left always win and you know the right side of history and all this and his video is about an hour and 15 minutes long so for those of you who watch my videos it's not a very long video but why does the left always win and I thought well and then he kept talking about it and he talked about basically conservative drift towards the left how Taft is more conservative than Ben Shapiro and on and on and on he goes over that through history and now notice 1518, I could have used 1517, we'll get there in a minute but and the more I thought about this, boy he's got a point and it's always, it's, you know, Peterson talks about the fact that when you have to change an idea it's painful because a little something in your head dies and you never like that death and so you know we always want everyone and everything to validate us and affirm us and agree with us and so when you find something that makes a good point and you have to admit it's like oh crap that's a good point and yeah there's issues with it but it's a good point and then you have the question of well what is left and right and I just finished watching a John Anderson video that also caught my attention. I hope there's a chance I might talk with John Anderson. Yeah that's something coming up. I've got some plans in the works for things and that should be on video but defining the left and the guy who John Anderson was talking to made the point that this left and right came from the French court where the progressives sat on the left and the conservatives sat on the right for the king and this has carried on through history and I always kind of wondered where this left and right comes from but of course this whole premise why does the left always win and like certainly during my lifetime I've seen a lot of that even though politically we tend to swing back and forth this kind of social progressivism keeps marching steadily onward and seems to get win after win after win now I've got some yeah buts about that for example prohibition but maybe that's even an example of the left well we'll get there so so I've got a lot I could say about that but I don't want that distracting me because there's a real point in here that he really made and and and so yeah he's the he's the he's the disruptivist and he disrupts my head and he bothers me and I I kind of like being bothered in that way and I don't and and so what exactly is the left and so it's hard to define and we know when we see it and and he talks quite a bit about that and it's a good video you should watch the whole thing and he talks about now this was a part of the reason when people kind of disrupt you is because they make points that you already agree on and then they make new points and they're and you know one of the things I've always said is that the republicans and the democrats they're you know they're not that far apart on many ways now there are obviously some defining issues that they use as wedge issues against each other and again I don't generally like talking a lot of politics in my video but my videos but I'll hazard it for this one and he talked about the the social structure of George Orwell's 1984 you have the inner party and the outer party and and he made the point that the you know the the the democrats and republicans they they we know the white house and the the power swings back and forth but the entire swinging is kind of continuing to march left and so the republicans are kind of loyal opposition and the distributist point is that you know you can't really look to them to you know to carry the day for you and and other conservatives that I listen to like Rod Rear has made similar points and and many many times over the years I've voted third party because I can't stand either party and and sometimes yeah they're they're the same in many ways and then he makes the point that left drift is cultural entropy and oh colonized my head you know the mug doesn't get put back together and and and so okay and yeah all right and and you know we're seeing this in a sense in terms of arcs of civilization and that's a favorite way of looking what is when does the american civilization hit its decline when does the british civilization hit its decline when does the roman empire hit its decline and you know those are big big arcs that that go over many many centuries sometimes and and how can we judge and can we judge from in the middle and what does that mean especially when we all have our own little arcs which is which are our lives and and then he said well you know maybe one way to frame it is I don't know that he said maybe but was righteousness and lawlessness now I've been I haven't posted the last couple weeks I have to get busy with that but in my adult sunday school class I'm going through first john and first john is a very black and white book and and and so we're dealing with that in the in the sunday school class but this righteousness and lawlessness is a thing is a theme in the new testament and there's the man of lawlessness that arises in the book of first corinthians and and jesus theme and the sermon on the mount is righteousness and before I've made the point that dallas willard and the divine conspiracy really helped me connect up jesus talks on righteousness with plato and his republic and righteousness and this theme of the ancient world of righteousness and what it is versus lawlessness and this is external in terms of the rule of law and law in a society but it's primarily internal and I just finished my my sermon jesus has a punchable face that I that's going up today today is friday friday the eighth friday february 8 and and so that rough draft for sunday video is going up today and and and I talk about the fact that you know you have to have an internal you have to have an internal law inside of you and and this and this internal law helps you say no to certain kinds of temptations that will be damaging to you and and and these things scale all the way out to society I lived you know I watched people complain about corruption in the united states and certainly there's corruption here but it's not like it was in a place like for example the dominican republic or many many other countries of the world this and and this corruption is you know it has to be found in individuals and that's why in a sense the the argument that a democracy cannot live with with you know if you don't have if you don't have a population with its own internal sense of morality and right and wrong and and resistance against corruption and and all of those issues and so you know gosh he made a good point with this one too in terms of righteousness versus lawlessness and I had to say yeah now again I can go into a bunch of yeah buts and there's there's ways that we can talk about that but it's a it's a good point and it's an important point and so yes to that one too I mean he's carrying me along through his arguments and I'm he's begrudgingly dragging me into them it's it's the relaxation of the inner law and this was a key thing in that video too that I'd never that I that I had seen some articles this week and I'd kind of been thinking about it but when he said it in this video I saw it and the relaxation of inner law is afforded by technology and so you actually have kind of a an internal heart corruption entropy which is which is which is supported and fueled and encouraged by the ongoing march of technology that that things that in the past let's say a young woman would have to be very careful about her selection of sexual partners because of the risk of pregnancy but now with reliable affordable sometimes free contraception you know she there's no there's very little risk of getting pregnant and so well then she can have sexual license but the further we go down that road the more we realize oh but the the the risk of pregnancy was only one risk and in fact there's a there's a vast rich deep metaphysical metaphorical reality that these old laws inhabited and now as technology affords us to affords us you know why why watch my weight and what I eat when I can control blood pressure and cholesterol with drugs why why go to the gym if I could if I could get my if I could get my my physical fitness in a drug why should I go to the hard work of getting a gym if I can get my spiritual experience by taking a psychedelic why go to the hard work of years of spiritual and religious discipline you know there's there's this way in which technology continues to to enable us and afford us the the easy wins and so you can kind of see the corrupt the corrupting nature of technological progress and if you start to if you start to pull all of these things together in a society his his point about leftward drift oh man I hate it when someone else is right and I gotta rethink myself and little little cherished ideas and norms in my head have to die in Christianity it kind of sets you up for this because there's a thing called mortification where where parts of us have to die so that Christ can become alive and so and then the question of course which this this one's easy because this one fear grabs hold of us and motivates us will the center hold is it is it all one big long slide down the slippery slope to to chaos and or tyranny and or destruction and the death of our civilization which all of us know that well at least Christians believe that civilizations all tumble and there's only one there's only one kingdom that will finally last and that is the kingdom of the son of man but of course I'm an American too and I don't want to see the chaos and the and the breaking down of of the achieved order that I enjoy in here early 21st century affluent America I I love the freedoms I possess I love the comforts I receive I love all of this stuff but then of course there's the opposition that says well it's a brave new world and and maybe Ray Kurzweil is is right and we'll offload our I don't really think we will because again the more we discuss if you also watch for Vakey and the and the cognitive science stuff that the idea that we'll just simply offload ourselves into a computer well the problem wasn't so much our limitation and computing power the problem was our ignorance of ourselves which is what we keep bumping into but of course the the eschatological promise of the religion of technology is that we will always find a fix for what ails us but that then pushes the question again it's back onto us what is a human being what exactly is flourishing and and then he said and then the distributist or the disruptivist said a trigger word for me which is salvation and if you're in my Sunday school class and you start using that word lightly I will jump on you because what and I don't want that doesn't mean I'll be mean to you I'll just say I'll define that word for me because saved from what or even more importantly and more difficult saved for what and and who is we and you know he makes the point that well we'll be saved by technology well the we and that are our you know are they those are cyborg ancestors who are half machine half human beings because you can't have these conversations without asking the the the the question of telos renovation from the inside out but towards what point to what point you need these you need these guiding stars in order to be able to orient us now one one young man who man who grew up in a different country and is in the United States doing graduate studies a very a fairly oppressive country I'm not going to name it because I don't want to risk any you know I don't want to risk anything but but ask the question at our meetup what is a utopia how would we define utopia and and and you know the point that it was making is that there's all of our little moral decisions are orient using are orienting us and pointing us towards some type of utopia or some type of endgame that that we imagine we imagine in our head we think we know what the good is that we're pointing to we think we know what salvation is and and so if you're conservative and you look at this leftward drift you say oh it's corruption while many people are cheering and saying oh it's improvement so you've got Steven Pinker on one side and you've got you know the the dis the disruptivist on the other side and you know here we go back and forth and and a lot of the question is well what is good saved for what saved from what who is we what is utopia what is truly good is it then in our meetup you know we talked about flow states and you know we always we often do some discussing of my videos but usually discussing of what other topics come in but you know if we could put a a helmet on with magnets in to get our brain into flow state so that we can properly function or if we can you know if we can if we can somehow shed our bodies and be free you know in some sense i'm continuing to read through Michael Paulin's book i'm enjoying that book it's a good book um you see that people ask me for favorite books and it's such a hard question for me because i often love the book i'm most stuck on right now i i fall in love with books and and then oh that was a wonderful book and then i'm on to the next book and so what's my favorite book it's probably the last book i really loved so you know enjoying Michael Paulin's book i'm a gifted author and i'm really appreciating his voice and and his ability to write and so so anyway so i distract myself but how do we know the good you know maybe just take some drug and take soma you've got brave new world and so the individual raised the utopian question he had just finished reading brave new world i thought yeah that book will get into your head but what stars do we navigate and to me this gets back to the sam harris jordan peterson conversation because sam said well well-being well we have we have a sense of well-being and and from what i could perceive from sam harris he thought that that sense of well-being just kind of scales and and what i get a sense of is that this is ab testing that this thing is better than that thing and a comfortable shoe is better than a shoe that pinches and a and a meal that tastes good is better than a meal that doesn't taste good and a relationship that feels good feels is better than a relationship that doesn't get feel good and jordan peterson via piaget pushes back with a with a devastating argument about the equilibrated state that in fact this it it this goodness not only has to scale for me and my neighbor and all the way out to everyone in humanity but also has to scale for for me and future me and and my descendants but also my ancestors and so you know piaget i you know i i like many of you had introduction to a little bit of developmental psychology in college and piaget and but i i what i what i'd love to see p i'd love to see peterson recommend a a book about piaget and his quest to to resolve the the science religion debate because that was the first time i'd ever heard that and i heard it from peterson and he talks about this equilibrated state and you you very much get the sense of well this is really a handle on on something like the kingdom of god or something like goodness and and peterson again and again points that you know you need reference points and and my point is that you really need reference points outside of the iron box of secularism and and that's why religion is so fundamentally important because you can actually look back in time through history and and and why concepts of revelation are important because they get metaphysical and you need you need something that big to an or to enable to orient it because this kind of a b testing uh jonathan mair had a tweet about you know well he was kind of riffing on uh conemarie my you know conemarie hits netflix my wife had done a conemarie thing in the house about about a year ago and it made me grumpy because oh she's throwing away all the stuff she wants to throw away some of my stuff and and she wants to change the house and so i was getting grumpy because usually if it's a good thing that i know it's a good thing and i don't want to go along i get grumpy because you know i love my i love my comforts and my and my and my pet sins and my and my self-indulgences but you know she organized her closet and her closet looked great and before you know it i thought i'm going to do that to my closet because i want my closet to look like hers so i went through my wardrobe and whatever and point that spark joy thing just really annoyed me it's like well spark joy the curmudgeon doesn't like that but okay i went through my went through my wardrobe and whatever didn't spark joy i got rid of and i got rid of all kinds of crappy stuff that was yeah too old and i'm not a fancy dresser y'all can see that um but you know but in the end it was a good thing and you know dog on it i was and that's the way it often is my poor wife you know she'll start down some road and i'll drag my feet and grumble and she'll get annoyed with me and then we'll have a little spat and you know and i'll back off and and then you know sometimes she'll be proven right and and then i'll have to say those most awful words in marriage you were right i was wrong you were wrong because of the words that you can't live without in a marriage but you know so but but this illiquid you know this this ab testing in the short run jonathan merritt makes the point that you should you know give up any throw out any theological system that doesn't spark joy it's quite frankly a bad idea because most of the most of the truths the really important truths in my life are truths that don't it doesn't give me the sense of sparking joy there there are things that i begrudgingly have to admit to or relinquish to um you know c.s lewis calls himself the world's you know england's most how did he say it reluctant convert and and so often you know this is part of the reason i'm i'm i associate with this label calvinism i identify with it is is because so often jesus has to pull me kicking and screaming and i don't want to go and dang it jesus is so strong and yeah but that's the way it is and and so yeah if i could do all my morality testing ab testing well actually that's a really bad way to judge morality and the real challenge is to is to work this equilibrated state idea to see what what ideas are better and right for the long term someone in the someone in the um someone in the meetup had seen some article somewhere that said that the german people were their happiest during the 30s and 40s which of course um came at the expense of the jews and the slobs and and everybody else in europe and then became they're more miserable and then i i haven't posted this conversation but i had a conversation with a young man from germany and he was telling me how you know germany's in kind of a mess because their identity in the 20th century you know they're the pariahs of the world which means that they can be guilted into almost anything and and you see that dynamic in individuals and what happens when a when a whole nation takes that on and you know on one hand it might look like christianity because it looks like generosity but generosity motivated by by the wrong things does not yield good fruit and so you know all this stuff is enormously complex so our little ab testing about goodness and sparking joy and and and morality that really doesn't that really can't get you there so so the distributist is a is a conservative roman catholic and so he says well what's the start of this the protestant reformation ah and i i get his point i get his point you know the rebels break the law and the church and the institute for their new cathedral as as he says in the video and there's a good point but now now you know you i'll kvetch out a bunch of things and i'll hold it to myself but when we get to this point i'll i can't hold back because the the the righteousness versus lawlessness that's a very nuanced subtle complicated dynamic and and you could make the point of paul who lays aside in fact that's exactly the point the judiizers make with paul you're setting aside circumcision you're setting aside dietary laws and and for the and for the gentiles perhaps as where did i make that point um i guess i made it probably in the sermon that i just that i just did the rough draft for that that you know one just as just as jordan peterson observes via nicha that the the discipline of catholicism in the west you know honed the the european spirit and strengthened it you you can make a similar argument that the the discipline of resisting polytheism in the old testament resisting the bales resisting molech resisting the gods of babalon resisting the gods of egypt that that this in the jewish people over centuries made them strong and durable so that they wouldn't assimilate you know in some ways the the world's most stubborn culture they wouldn't assimilate and and what that is for the most brought them over centuries is is pain and and hatred and but you know there's a but they held together that way and they they remained themselves that way and and so you might argue that jesus you know this is exactly the point of jesus culture war jesus you're soft on on roman sex trade of young jewish girls jesus you're soft on on fasting why aren't your disciples fasting well when the bridegroom is there they don't you know the the the the party doesn't fast and jesus although those things could be excuses for holding the line against the corruption that the romans are bringing to our society so yeah oh i see the point on the protest and reformation but one could make similar points on jesus and paul and and there's a sense in which the fight against lawlessness becomes legalism and as i think it was tertullian said you know on one half on one side you fall off the horse on the antinomian side on the other side the legalist side so there are issues with this whole argument but there's real value in this argument there's insight to be gained by thinking through this argument and wrestling with this argument for most for most good arguments they are they are things that you really have to live with and then they're like you know not really a little angel or a devil on your shoulder but they're they're like a little personality in the back of your head and you'll run along and like you see something and that person says yep yep yep yep that's that's my point and and so the the consciousness committee tries to keep you you know keep you keep you honest via those kinds of things in bonhoeffer you know again books uh bonhoeffer's cost of discipleship and if if if you've never read bonhoeffer's cost of if you never any bonhoeffer read bonhoeffer so many good authors but bonhoeffer of course was was was was part of the german elite that didn't go along with hitler and um was was part of a a conspiracy to um to assassinate hitler and paid for his participation in that in a um in a german prison and was eventually executed before the end of the war but you know he was one of these outliers who wouldn't go along and you know lived an interesting life and someone who could have escaped germany you know he he was he had access he had money he had status he could have escaped germany but he stayed and he and he stayed at the cost of his life and he writes in his book the cost of discipleship which which warns against cheap grace and and so here in christianity you're always dealing with how to deal with the law and so people ask about what's the difference between lutheranism and calvinism well calvin calvin brought up both both luther and calvin would be horrified that we have those two labels today by the way so maybe i should stop using calvinism as a label but you know calvin said we have the you know luther had this stark antithesis between law and grace and and given luther's story you can have that calvin is a second generation reformer he he says well he comes up with the third use of the law the law is to you know the use of the law by civil magistrates to keep order that's that's fair but the third use of the law is to is is now we can express gratitude so those of you if you watch my rough dress for sunday see misery deliverance gratitude misery deliverance gratitude we use the law to express our gratitude to god because in a sense the law does in fact reflect god's desires but now we don't use the law as um as a way of saving ourselves so if you look at the heideberg catechism the treatment of the ten commandments comes in the gratitude portion this is this is how we as christians live the christian life and this is how calvin tries to you know kind of pull back from luther but one of the big one of the big questions one of the big issues throughout christianity in the west now i know the orthodox have have uh the orthodox come in and say yeah if you'd listen to us you wouldn't have these problems with with grace and law and some of those things um and maybe i'll have those conversations when i talk to my friend luke thompson from twitter one of these days but we're always dealing with this question of of of faithfulness and lawlessness or righteousness and lawlessness and you know i'm a big fan of tim keller and tim keller better than most persuasively argues that for for tim keller you can find the veritas forum you google or you search it on youtube you'll find it tim keller homosexuality and watch the whole conversation um debate where he'll you know where they they they really try to corner poor tim on some of this stuff and tim will basically make the point it's self-righteousness that gets you damned well what do you mean by that and and actually that's that's very existentialist tim keller is a big fan of kirkegaard uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh i know esther doesn't seem to like tim keller near as much as i do nor kirkegaard but julian will like that um those of you who don't pay much attention to the comments these are all these are all folks that i've met since i've started this this crazy wonderful journey into youtube land but you know so you have this question of well how does this all work and this continues to be a live debate and and part of converse big part of the conversation in western christianity what is the relationship between righteousness and lawlessness and where are the inflection points and and that's why this is all is hard so then you have the the cycles of civilization rome descends into chaos and the church and monasticism grows a new humpty dumpy over a thousand years but you might argue that you know from 500 to 1500 roughly the the middle ages is you know there you is that a heyday of christianity and does does then protestant reformation um provoke the the next descent which we're 500 years into so is the cycles kind of western civilization or is it certain nations the rise and fall of france the rise and fall of britain the rise and fall of the dutch empire the rise and fall of the american empire now our poets prophesy zombies and the dystopian future where once again inner strength offers communal competitive advantage um you know if you watch the if you watch the walking dead or or any other dystopian futuristic things you know so often the the inner conflicts must i must i put my life at risk to avoid killing or shall i kill instantly i mean these things hover around various dystopian future apocalyptic movies because that that's really where it engages and again it's the question of inner strength or inner righteousness and and the risk and part of why part of a point that i make often in terms of my messages are that this is exactly where the resurrection comes in because by virtue of the resurrection if you believe in that you believe in fact that kind of risk is warranted and in fact jesus models it and demands it jesus says you don't believe in life after death i'll go first you don't believe in resurrection i'll go first and you might say well yeah but that was jesus and it's like yeah but did anybody rise from the dead before him he had to have faith too to go to the cross and be beaten and be crucified and wear the mocking spittle of his enemies say well i don't believe in the resurrection well okay what options does that leave for you your well-being at the expense of your enemies your political tribes well-being at the at the bloodshed of your political adversaries that's where that goes and what the resurrection affords is to do what jesus does where in the garden when he's being arrested and peter pulls a sword and cuts off the ear of the high priest and jesus says oh no and he heals the ear and in a sense what jesus says is if there's going to be any bloodshed shed my blood first who says that that doesn't make the resurrection a cheap trick it makes the resurrection a promise so so so you've got these these arcs of civilization so is it western christendom that that the protestant reformation is now corrupting is it is it the american empire that's going to fall and and will will we in a sense you know will the will the ecology collapse or will it's it's ironic because those on the left right now are fearing ecological collapse and those on the right are fearing moral collapse and i would say yeah probably both you know probably everything it's you know this weird combination of sort of a a a quarter as jonathan hite calls the cortical the cortical lottery a cortical lottery winner so i'm by nature rather happy and optimistic but i've you know i i've been born into one of the most dour religious traditions possible calvinism you're all depraved but yet chris calvin is dour you know cow dour pessimism is in the midst of this glorious christian optimism christianity is the original divine comedy the bible is the original divine comedy and i talked about that in my sister's eulogy that you can find on this page and it talks about that in my father's eulogy that you can find on my youtube site that's way before i started doing this stuff or my aunt's eulogy that i posted i don't have a lot of confidence in technology because our track record with technology is it gives and takes away and and technology especially in this frame that that the distributist and mentis mold bug show is that technology is an enabler of in the sense our of in the sense our internal destruction isn't that interesting and and it makes perfect sense of course we're going to make things to make sinning possible of course we're going to make things to that make that make our ease possible and that ease will will make us soft and we're going to be all in those chairs on wall e floating around of course technology brings us this way it also gives us many things and then you know i i want medical technology so here we are the different time marks i just talked about that you know let me not see the collapse of my culture let my let my kids not see the collapse of their country but let let and let the like let the ice shelf in antarctica not fall so that i have to see florida go under but all civilizations fall and again i'm a christian so god's kingdom will come and and it's sort of an apocalyptic parental control steps in and the eschaton begins but now we have to ask the question which story governs and we're back to the worldview choices menu here are you postmodern there is no story and and this is why i think progressive liberation might liberationism might just be natural religion and that's you know that that's that's entropy that's that's the slide left that's that's where this all goes we keep we keep looking for the liberation to be freed from all of brief freed from the the the necessity of self-control and drew dyke who is an author um is an author and he's up in portland and i follow him on twitter and he was on the phil visher uh sky jatani podcast a number of times and i only kind of know him through twitter but just recently wrote a book on self-control and i haven't read it yet i haven't even bought it maybe i will i don't know those i'm about to say something get me in trouble but that type of christian book ike you know i can usually just kind of page through quickly yeah good point just good points maybe it's a great book i don't know i think drew's a great guy i love what he does on twitter but you know maybe that is in fact the slide that that technology and entropy and and we're just releasing ourselves some self-control until everything falls away because we can't manage life in this world without self-control and the most in a sense the most wonderful of all political situations democracy can't exist without self-control and and then we're just going to have these cycles of tyranny that we fall into fall into it and maybe we'll be happy and say yeah i was i was fortunate enough to have lived in the united states at the end of the 20th and beginning of the 21st century and only begun began to saw the to see the decline but you know it's it's helpful to to read history too because what you find is that many times in many places we you know we're we're on the edge and and 1930s america was was on the edge and 1950s america was on other edges and and and we're always on the edge one way or another and that's why i talk about the age of decay life is not stable life in this world is not stable and it never has been and i don't think it ever will be because again one of how this video the distributist video really helped me see was this relationship between between this drift left and technology and how these two things are combined and how that scales out and i don't have all my language on that but it's in my head and my consciousness committee is working on it so i'm sure it'll leak out in more videos to come but that's a real thing and and the point that he made in that video yep you know you colonized me baby you colonized me but now we're back to which story governs is it post-modernity if if there if post-modernity is basically just chaos chaos and power in worldview and that doesn't go anywhere good and and because it scales back down into us and and it makes me want to say why don't i just give in to all of my all of my internal desires why don't i why don't i give in and you know why why be faithful to a wife why be faithful to a lord why be faithful to a religious tradition why be kind to people on the street why be you know why why not just indulge myself eat drink and be married because tomorrow you die and you've got axial eschatology so you know i'm working through verveky and his stuff and you know that he's he's right and that all of these systems they're axial and and there's a there's a dynamic when by which if you can identify the development of something in history in a sense you demythologize it and you de-enchant it and you know kind of learning about the axo revolution i can feel that having that impact on me and i have to i have to think through those issues i have to think about the endless or the endless cycles of paligenesis which is with something like hinduism you know you ask um ask some hindus well why why if everything is this one great sea of of oneness and perfection it devolves into the chaos and then it goes back into the sea and it goes back into chaos and so you have this perpetual chaos in order swing and then it goes back into the so you have this perpetual chaos in order swinging back and forth i mean a number of eastern world views play on these issues and and so you have russian doll which again i mentioned and recommended on netflix do you seek resolution and escape but then escape into what and again i'll prefer my my actual age axial age eschatology and and if you if you push me i'll say can can you imagine what what life of the age to come is like and i say no i can't that's because i see all kinds of issues will will will the order get suffocating will there not be enough chaos what does it mean that there isn't any sea and and so then i look to smarter wiser people like c.s lewis and his book the last battle and i i work through i think about those things but finally again i think what's what's at the heart of calvinism is is is finally trust and i say you know what lord i i might my brain isn't big enough my my the amount of books that i can read and the amount of things that i can see in my one little short life it ain't big enough and i'll never know it all and i'll never see it at all and i'll always be biased and i'll always be petty and i'll always be wrestling with my own desires and urges and and and i'll always get stuff wrong and i'll never be loving enough and i will never make it so i'm gonna trust you and and i'm gonna believe that you are as good as you say you are and i'm gonna believe that that jesus is the image of the invisible god and i'm gonna believe that he walked out of that tomb and i'm gonna believe that that this affords me the this affords me the at the joyful yet suffering path of faithfulness and love in my relationships around me even if the world is going to hell in a handbag and someone someone made a comment in my conversation with with with alistair you know how alistair and i both you know when jordan peterson gets too mired in politics we start to we start to grumble and someone said yeah but that's because you're living in that's because you're living in a you know that you think of a few best men you can't handle the truth there's people that stand on a wall that buy your that buy your comfort and buy your freedoms at the cost of their blood and that's right and that's a good point that's an important point and and how do you know that if you weren't in the prison camp that you wouldn't be just like look at tim keller telling the story of eric little uh at the end of tim keller's talk at princeton at princeton seminary where and i've mentioned this in other videos before where where eric little you know all the other priests and religious leaders and missionaries in that camp were just as cutthroat as everyone else and eric little shone like the sun and you'll find those stories coming out of concentration camps where everyone out everyone again that's the walking dead it's the zombie apocalypse everyone gets gets petty and selfish and self-interested my well-being at the expense of everyone else and someone there will be a saint and they will give their life for the others and they won't do it you know just just we're so we're so moment fixated there's one grand gesture in which it's given no they'll do it slowly bit by bit like jesus jesus dodges death again and again and they tried to kill him and they tried to stone him and not jesus not not my time jesus to be a saint does not mean being a doormat or a wallflower to be a saint means you do exercise judgment you do exercise agency you do say no to people but but but sainthood you learn to do it in a way that it's always for love and it's always finally for for the welfare not just simply the little a b welfare that that's so often you know that's what happens that someone the little little sid harta shears from the sermon i preached last week you know you know my daughter doesn't know sin oh your daughter knows plenty of sin honey just show her the word she's probably going to become like your parents you know when the beggar on the street asks you for a dollar do you give him the dollar there's a b you know i give him the dollar why do i give him the dollar to get him off my back and i dealt with this all the time in the dominican republic you come out from come out from some place and some kid pops up i watched your car all right you watched my car do i give you a few pesos just because it's expedient do i give you a few pesos because you're a poor kid you're just trying to survive and there's no way you can or do i give you a few few pesos just to get you off my back so you can get you off my back so you do the a b morality and they say yeah but you if you if you encourage that kind of behavior it scales boom boom boom boom boom and so i need someone to follow in this stuff and so i follow jesus well what would jesus do well it's a really hard question it's not little a b morality it scales all the way out and if i were the one in in eric little's prison camp would i be just like one of those other missionaries that maybe i would you know it's it's hard to say but but the point the point is that it's misery deliverance gratitude and i'm finally saved by grace not saved by my performance and i would hope i would have the kind of gratitude to to not fail my master even though i know often i have the grind i don't have the kind of gratitude because i do fail my master so which story governs the option you embrace impacts the way you navigate your little cycle i don't think a b testing on goodness or wellness sam is going to get you very far pomo which is basically chaos and world view eat drink and be merry pal and genesis karma no it's too law it's too law renovation of heaven and earth costly love is the right side of history that's what the resurrection says it requires inner strength which actually preserves society you are the salt of the earth you are the light of the world jesus says in the sermon on the mount it affords you release from self-salvationism tribal pressure for righteous compliance and virtue because here's the thing with and tim keller makes these points better than just about anybody i know here's the thing about self-righteousness if or here's the thing about the law if i if i achieve in complying with the law i have now exercised the inner strength to possess that and i can look down at all of those people that don't have it and one of the things that we know is that this this business about having inner strength is not just i mean there's there's two there's two competing frames of human beings one is that we have no agency that we're just playing out the the bad things that happen to us as a child or the good things that happen to us as a child so the so the strong do well and the weak do poorly and and therefore there is no agency you can't hold anyone accountable or the other vision is that where it's all agency and you know you know by by by free will and sheer determination i had a my my wife had an aunt who in the 1980s when crack was going on used to brag because she'd say you know they say that once you take that first hit of crack you're addicted i'm pretty strong-willed i think i could take crack and and the idea of watching aunt ruth take crack that just really that tempted me mightily i thought it wouldn't be too hard to places i lived it's not too hard to get some crack give it to aunt ruth she never would smoke it because of course but she just wanted to make that point that she would if she smoked crack she would become addicted and i thought ah you sure are a big believer in your will and the irony was that she's passed now um but but she had she had a hard life and uh that's the thing and so those two world views of of of we have no agency or we're all agency we're we're in a mixture and we're a mess but you can't give up agency but you can't give up understanding and so that's the problem with the law is that even if it's inside well i alone no but then you're a pharisee then you're uh that's not really fair to the pharisees then you're a legalist and you look down on others and and so i i think tim keller is exactly right that the real the real way to understand it is you're saved by grace which means that i can't look down on those who are weak because i'm weak but but i can't live with without i i need the third use of the law again that's why i'm a calvinist i need the third use of the law i i need to i it's it's at the end of saving private ryan i've used this before where where where private ryan is there and tom hanks and a squad have given up their life to to fulfill this order which maybe is kind of a crazy and stupid order and and tom hanks dying last words to this young man are earn it and he wants to live his life living up to the great sacrifice and and i think that's one view into the christian life we live our lives trying to live up to that great sacrifice and we know we never will but but it's but it's so beautiful and it's so right and it's so noble and and it all comes together that i say how do i want to live i want to live like him and he says live like me and die like me and you will live again and we'll go further up and further in and why be a christian because i don't think there's any more beautiful way to live that's why i do it someone asked me in an email and if you still listen to my videos he's still sending me emails um you know why do you believe in god i believe in god because i've always believed in god i was raised believing in god we only jettisoned beliefs when we have so sufficient beliefs to to get rid of the old ones that doesn't answer why i'm a christian for most of human history most people have believed in god and the world was a mess just having people believe in god doesn't prove much of anything so the book of james says seeing the beauty of christ that will change your heart that you decide i'll willingly suffer i'll willingly i'll willingly sacrifice parts of me for the other doesn't you don't do it because the other is beautiful you realize that doing it makes the other beautiful and you realize doing it you you run towards the goal that's what the apostle paul says so why does the left always win i don't know why does the age of decay always win but ah resurrection so the the disruptivist strikes again keep striking my friend it's uh it's it's it's great being wrong in all the right ways
