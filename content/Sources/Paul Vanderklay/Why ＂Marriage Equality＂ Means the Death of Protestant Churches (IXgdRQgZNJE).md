 Hi, this is Paul. I know a lot of you clicked on this video because of the title and some of you will leave this video right away because I'm not don't have three or four points to just justify this claim but for those of you who are used to my channel, you know, what's coming and Just to give you fair warning this is one of these inklings that I have and And I think I have evidence for it but I'm still very much working out the ideas and so if you click down this video for a Finished argument boom boom boom boom boom there it is that you can feel validated by or push back against or hate You might as well click away now Because what's coming at you is a lot of wondering and a lot of nuance and a lot of listening. I'm I'm Well, let's get into it so just that's just a warning because I know with a title like this some of you are gonna click on it and you're What now and and within 30 seconds you're gone. I look at YouTube analytics I understand that and that's I'm totally good with that I know YouTube wants me to produce content that will keep you here for the whole two hours but that's now how I use my channel I use my channel to think out loud and Around my channel is a group of similarly insane people who like to hear me think out loud and Write back to me in the comment section and other different ways. So Here we are Why marriage equality leads to the death of Protestant churches now that word Protestant is really important there and I know for for you Orthodox and Roman Catholics you're gonna cheer and For protestant some of you are gonna be angry because no it's marriage equality is the future of the Protestant Church Could be I don't know When I'm asked about this issue often I say we don't have anywhere near enough time to know the answer to this and I stick by that answer but I've got inklings and I've had some thoughts over the last couple of weeks that I want to share with you about this now On a video I recently made someone when I made the comment about the end of new atheism somebody said no atheism is on the rise read the studies more carefully the nuns are on the rise and Actually getting at how to categorize people on these ideas. It's tremendously difficult if not pointless The point is that many many people in North America are leaving the church as their let's say Spiritual practice I'll use that language and the nuns are rising but that doesn't mean nuns give up spiritual practice They're spiritual but not religious There's then we have the the fun with the definition of religion and so there's all kinds of things and again for those of you Who listen to my channel a lot, you know all this stuff What is true is? Rodriere a few years ago Wrote a piece that basically said The last Episcopalian has already been born And that was following and some of you say oh, that's Rodriere. He's an alarmist. Okay That was following as many of Rodriere's articles are Philip Jenkins who has written some very interesting history books Who was writing on the on the pathos blog? Not really not at all as an evangelical just making the point that The mainline church has been falling through the floor And the mainline church has been the part of the church that has been most enthusiastic in fact most demanding about marriage equality and Everybody in fact if you're in sort of a moderate denomination like mine the Christian Reformed Church of North America There's a lot of anxiety about not embracing marriage equality in order to keep the youth because many young people who grew up in Christian Reformed homes are saying I'm not going to go to a church. That's bigoted or If my church won't accept my gay friends. I want no part of it and So the Christian Reformed Church whose median age I think is already in the 50s it's a church in many ways that I think is Facing a terminal death probably I think it'll come quicker because of this fight But This argument is that this is going to save the church when all of the data from the Presbyterian Church of the USA from the Episcopalian Church from the United Methodists is that this fight is a killer and This fight will take your church out now. Do I mean local church or denomination? I'm a little fuzzy on that here in terms of the title of this video Now some will say well, there's some there's some there's some large thriving even even Affirming megachurches fair enough, but they're the exception that in some ways proves the rule and again, I go back to my previous position that I Don't know that we've been with these questions long enough To really have much perspective on perspective on that I don't know that we've been with these questions long enough to really have much perspective on perspective on them at all in terms of many of the frames that we're dealing with them within but I Think this is true. I think and I think I can say give you some plausible reasons Why marriage equality leads to the death of Protestant churches and a lot of these reasons are not Along the lines that you usually hear Protestants say such as well the Bible says so or they're rebelling against God I'm not I'm not arguing with those religious reasons. Okay, that's not the point of this video The point of this video is I'm going to be speaking to a much broader perspective at least broader in terms of how we tend to conceptualize it in in secular society Jordan Peterson would say some psychological reasons for it. Now. I'm not a psychologist So I won't claim to speak with authority on psychology, but there are some things that I see that I want to share and I've been trying to figure out how to make a video about this for about two weeks now Now there are matrix of ideas in my mind that are undeveloped which is why I make videos and again That's why I gave the disclaimer right at the top of the video if you're still watching That if you're expecting five clean points about Why marriage equality leads to the death of Protestant churches if you're you know it's expecting the video version of some of some listicle you've come to the wrong channel because I Just don't do that and I don't do that for a lot of reasons that I'm not going to go into right now because I'm already Way too ADHD But this is why I make videos because I need to think out loud to think through these things I've been writing on CRC voices, which is decades old listserv that I've participated on partly because In that listserv there are good friends of mine like Len van de Zee who's been on this channel is a part of all one body And Len and I think differently about a number of things But I very much love and trust and respect Len and CRC voices is one of the few places I know where we can actually have a significant productive conversation about issues like this because in most places in the Christian Reformed Church and in most places in Society at large those spaces to have a productive conversation are shutting down fast Because well people have already made up their minds and that's fair. Well, I'm very high in openness and so Even after I've come to working conclusions and decisions about my life Working conclusions and decisions about things my mind is still open about these things And so even though most Christian reform ministers have decided what side of this debate that they're on and by the way Most of them are traditional should come as a surprise to nobody who has any deep understanding of the Christian Reformed Church. I Still think about it just like I still think about women in office and what is what the experience of the of the Christian Reformed Church Has been with experimenting on women in office since the late 90s So there's more going on in the death of the mainline than just marriage equality Okay Because marriage equality I think is the expression of another ideal Beneath the church that has become an implicit confession that I think is unstable and finally untenable And I think it's for the end and I think actually it makes the church unnecessary the mainline church peaked during the Cold War and there were deep reasons for that and with the end of the Cold War the church has been in incredibly steady decline and There are lots of reasons for that far beyond marriage equality But I think embracing marriage equality is sort of a poison pill for again. I'm gonna say it Protestant churches I'm limiting my analysis to that group now those of you who are Orthodox and Roman Catholic I'm sure you'll glean from this video a bunch of points that you'll probably use and fighting your own little intramural fights But as I get into this there's a dynamic aspect of this that is deeply connected with Protestantism. All right Now there might also be a deep connection between how and why and what kinds of groups we create to achieve What what you know certain sorts of things in our lives? And that's actually a lot of what this video is about and this is why I'm going to be playing again Some video that I've commented on which is Jordan Peterson and Jonathan Peugeot's conversation, but now after Jonathan had that conversation he messaged me and was very excited about the conversation and and I after watching the video wasn't as excited about the conversation now. That's a nor that's a sort of a regular experience for me I remember watching the Jordan Peterson Sam Harris talks and initially feeling sort of frustrated But the longer I sat with them the more value I saw in them and that's probably that's a that's a fairly common pattern with me and I think that pattern is because we have to initially see things in low resolution and Given time the value of things begins to emerge and sort of seep up from them And I think that's very much true of the Jordan Peterson Jonathan Peugeot conversation Even though I think probably that that was his best conversation in in the second wave I'm going to talk about why marriage equality and I'm using the the term that most people who promote it want to use and There's a reason for that term and I have a lot more ideas about the relationship between hierarchy and equality and how Jesus and Christianity Completely rewrote human history in terms of that polarity But in this thing why marriage equality destabilized? why is marriage equality destabilizing to the traditional marriage ideal and some of the consequences of that and Again, I'm not going to go to the Bible and then pull up verses and say well We're going to appeal to biblical authority to make this argument. I'm not going to do that I'm gonna appeal to reason so those of you who don't like the Bible or don't like Christianity or don't like religion Well, there's something in this video for you because I'll be using reason How do aspirations desires and ideals work together to form voluntary organizations that idea is key in this and this is where this begins to intersect with my thinking about the rise and fall of Mars Hill my reading about Of well wellman's book I have to learn his name Basically God as a drug Does Protestantism use the state for its implicit two-speed religion now some of you might remember Over the course of this channel. I've talked a lot about one speed and two-speed religion taking that from Charles Taylor's secular age and You know, I've gotten a fair amount of pushback on that from Mary and from other Roman Catholics and Orthodox haven't really Talked to me about that issue But this issue for me sort of energizes that because there's a strange alignment between Protestantism the rise of the nation-state Protestantism and the change sort of the modernization of the monarchy which sounds Strange but but actually makes sense when you think about it because the kind of the kind of monarchies that we saw in early modern Europe, I think were in some ways a combination of the ability to create Monarchical nation-states whereas prior to modernity I Forget what I think I got this from the rest its history prior to modernity monarchy was sort of First to money first among equals that there were lords and the monarch was one of the lords and and That was sort of the monarchy and and actually there's a parallelism in Protestant churches with respect to elder rule and whether the pastor is an elder or not So there's a lot of interesting Complexity below the surface but but there that is now again as I mentioned I Last week instead of making videos I spent a fair amount of time doing some writing on CRC voices and the kind of writing I do on CRC voices It's full of typos and it's all completely first draft and it's right off the top of my head It's basically like my videos and before I made videos I had CRC voices and my blog and I would just write and dump things there and I dump it on the The poor folks on CRC voices and leave it for them to sort out which they usually do kindly because it's a small group and we all know each other and love each other and Fight like family. That's what we do on CRC voices. We fight like family But that fight on CRC voices is very much parallel to the bigger fight in the Christian Reformed Church where we're fighting like family over the question of marriage equality and Whether the Christian Reformed Church should recognize same-sex marriages in the way that first the Canadian government and the American government did in a lot of ways that's what this fight is about and there's a Let's call them a political action group in the Christian Reformed Church called all one body Which is made up of a lot of people I know and care about because remember I'm I'm really from the CRC left and So they're making videos and they're making videos explaining Why they think what they think and right now they're doing it because in 2016 See the pattern in the Christian Reformed Church, which makes sense in a Protestant Church has always been well, we're going to go to the Bible to figure out what to do and Between the 70s and the 90s they worked that really hard Over the question of whether or not women should be allowed to serve an ecclesiastical office and It didn't arrive anywhere. And so finally the church sort of gave up on it because this is gonna come later in the video because many conservatives not all and moderates and Progressives could agree it was not a confessional issue and so the Christian Reformed Church basically said Local option with respect to women in church office and In classes which are the mid-level judiciaries the regional assemblies Classes could decide whether or not to seat women elders and pastors based on vote and then synod would allow women to be at the binational assembly once a Majority of classes Seated women at classes and that happened in the mid 90s and I was actually at the first I was a delegate to the first Senate where women were seated and I'm not gonna make a video right now on my thoughts about women in office, but I've not opposed it Okay, and in fact in practice, I've been a part of helping a number of women Find their way into professional ministry and Some of you notice that on my on the church channel sometimes every now and then there'll be a woman preacher at Living Stones and You know, okay Go ahead and post those comments. That's fine Like I said, even though I make decisions about things I still think about them and That makes people uneasy because it's like I want you to be open until you arrive at my position and then lock the door And bolt it. Well, I'm not really that way So all one body has been around for a while but the Christian Reformed Church Many imagined that the Christian Reformed Church would just borrow the women in church office playbook to deal with a question of same-sex marriage as it was legalized in the United States and Canada and so there have been series of synodical reports on Homosexuality all sorts of things the 73 report I think of 99 2000 and ever since really the 21st century the focus has been on cat pastoral care That's that's sort of been the camel's nose to get into these conversations. And and so a report came in 2016 to synod on pastoral care trying to give advice to the churches and as Happened in the women in church office Fights in the 70s to the 90s. There was a majority and minority report now I don't want to bog you down in synodical procedural minutia Which is part of church polity and part of maintaining a denomination but Basically Senate 2016 Saw what was coming because of experience its experience with women in church office and said we don't want to go down that road Because if we keep having successive Synodical committees to Give us answers from the Bible and theology and science about what we should do with this topic We're gonna keep having majority and minority reports and we're gonna wind up sort of like we wound up with women in church office at You know deciding on a practical Compromise that will basically get this off The synodical docket now again part of this has been from watching the reports Church of America the denomination that the Christian Form Church split off of in the 19th century The reform Church in America was the daughter of the state church in the Netherlands the church that in the 19th century the Dutch version of the Christian Form Church split off of and The Christian Form Church had been watching the reform Church of America just in agonizing Forever conflict over this issue and said we don't want to go down that road either So we're not going to do just another synodical report We're gonna jigger the committee and so you can find videos about that on the all one body website, too And they said we are only going to put people on this next synodical committee Who affirm the traditional position and in that way? We're not going to get a majority minority report that basically kicks it to Senate and for Senate to say No, we're not going down the road of affirming or inclusion now the progressives Of course are sort of hoping that the overall see change in the countries will continue to change people's minds and Open people up to the idea of marriage equality in the Christian Form Church And in time because that's sort of the progressive ethos and assumption in time The Christian Form Church will embrace marriage equality That's the idea behind all one body and they're just following the women in office playbook But of course the conservatives in the Christian Form Church said we don't like how the last thing went So guess what? We're not going to follow the playbook So basically in 2020 Senate 2020 the human sexuality report Abbreviated HSR human sexuality report was released and it was a conservative report Obviously because that's the committee they put together And it's a hundred and seventy-two And it's a hundred and seventy-two Obviously because that's the committee they put together and It's a hundred and seventy pages. So if you want to read it, it's free on the internet I'll leave a link below and you can find it as I'll leave a link to the all one body website And of course we've had COVID so we've had two Senate's Delayed and so it's gonna come to Senate 2022 if that one happens See how many Greek letter variants will have of cove it going down the road But right now so the strategy for all one body it's really a two-prong strategy one prong is defeat the human sexuality report because the thing that the report does is basically state at the end of it that Subscription to traditional marriage is a confessional issue That's a game-changer and that's different from the women in church office debate Because now suddenly Christian reform ministers and office bears that are pro marriage equality Might find themselves liable to church discipline Nobody really expects that to happen though Now I mentioned that there's a two-prong approach one one one is to make sure that this doesn't happen that the human sexuality Report is defeated so they they're devoting a big YouTube video campaign to try to To try to defeat that now At least from the videos I've seen so far and the numbers on them. I'm gonna give them the biggest bump. They're gonna get At the same time The other prong is as I mentioned before in some previous videos that Some churches in classes Grand Rapids East most specifically Neeland Avenue Ordained a Lesbian deacon To office and It's a way sort of the way Christian form polity works There was a test case and in Toronto a number of years ago and basically classes Toronto Sort of agreed to handle first CRC's Toronto's Question about ordaining a gay elder in Probably in a same-sex marriage because it happened in Canada earlier and The CRC there's you know, this cry went up in the CRC and classes Toronto said we'll handle it Don't worry about anything. It won't happen and it all went away sort of But Classes Grand Rapids East they've written a document about it. The classes itself is split on it The churches themselves are split on it if Senate 2022 says to classes Grand Rapids East Shut it down classes and classes Grand Rapids East says no and Then Senate says we're gonna find this an article machinery to in fact shut down your classes and that church You know already there's been fights on the internet about whether or not Senate has that power so Yeah, this is a really big fight in the Christian form church and because of the way it went with women in church office There the question is whether or not there are enough votes to actually pursue discipline And in some ways all one body is counting on they're not being because that's sort of been the strategy in the reformed church strategy in the reformed Church of America and in other Protestant denominations where the the church polity is loose enough that you can allow sort of these movements to grow and What happens then at some point is conservatives get tired enough? So they leave the denomination and form little denominations of their own or join other conservative denominations that Basically have it written that they oppose it and if you bleed off enough Conservatives, maybe the progressives will have enough votes to carry the day or Maybe people just won't care enough about the denomination and there'll be little as there are and let's say the Presbyterian Church of the USA There'll be little churches around that sort of shrugged their shoulders at it say wherever we're we're sort of Denominational but not really we really mostly care about our little church and as long as the denomination doesn't bother us and cost us too much We'll leave it alone and in denominations like the PC USA churches that have wanted to leave for echo and other Evangelical Protestant Church of America EPCA. I mean, this is all Protestant acronyms on this stuff You know the denomination has basically taken local churches Significant church here in Sacramento that went through this fight Taking them to court saying you can't leave you can leave the denomination But you can't take your building with you Which is tremendously offensive to local churches because they say you didn't pay for this church We did and so churches like Fremont Press and Sacramento sort of paid for their building twice in fact They prayed paid more for it the second time because they had to give some kind of settlement Settlement based on market value and when they built the building probably in the 60s The property values were far less than they are right now in Sacramento today. So the whole thing has been this enormous mess in Protestantism and I know You Roman Catholics have your own little Tremors about these things and of course Rod Rear found Roman Catholicism insufficiently serious so as to hop over to the Orthodox and I know that Rod Rear is not alone. So Yeah, there's a lot going on here. And again, this is about Protestant churches Now Burn sent me this video Burn Power has his own station the the anadromist sent me this video With Tim Keller because he knows I'm a big Tim Keller fan Tim Keller and Kevin D. Young to you know celebrity PCA now PCA is Protestant Church in America. They're a conservative denomination That doesn't allow women in church office and certainly, you know has been conservative on these human sexuality issues But you know, that's even shaking the PCA That's something PCA is more conservative in the Christian reform church if you're looking at these kinds of metrics and Both Tim Keller and so Kevin D. Young used to be a pastor in the Reformed Church of America in Lansing, Michigan and Like I said before part of the dynamics is he just got fed up with Reformed Church of America fighting about this So he joined the PCA. He was a celebrity pastor in the Foreign Church of America Again, this now bleeds over into the rise and fall of Mars Hill mega churches, etc, etc So he's now met member the PCA he and Tim Keller as they note earlier have in the video have you know A variety of issues that they differ on Tim Keller is sort of a If you can be a liberal in the PCA Tim Keller is it and for that reason There's lots of people in the PCA who don't like Tim Keller because he's he's soft on a lot of things that Someone like let's say Kevin D. Young is hard on Probably shouldn't have said it that way, especially with a video like this, but you know what I mean and I I listened to this video and parts I could agree with parts I didn't agree with it'd be very interesting some of you Orthodox Roman Catholics listening to it I mean the Presbyterian Church in America the PCA is a very serious church when it comes to its theology in some ways in different ways a little bit differently and this is some of the difference between the English Presbyterian and the Dutch Calvinists. Okay, and Notice D. Young Dutch name from the RCA. So There's some differences there but but Tim Keller is you know, he's a big fan of the Heideberg catechism He's a big fan of the Dutch Reformed. So so Tim Keller actually has a little bit of Dutch Reformed DNA floating around in his theological matrix, too anyway the PCA celebrity pastors they had a group that crafted 12 statements and they walked through those statements in this little video and They even commented about this video might this video might be too long and I said 49 minutes Pots is But they have a point I understand that point Protestants tend to default to what does the Bible say we should and shouldn't do Americans tend to default to that and again if you go back to it's no longer on the bio logos website which is a shame Mark Knoll wrote really a wonderful piece a number of years ago that I basically downloaded and kept in my files because One of the things you learn if you try to use the Internet as a filing cabinet is that stuff gets taken down So if you want some things you better make copies of it There's the way back machine. I know What does the Bible say we shouldn't shouldn't do and you know again within the PCA even within the CRC That's a big part of these fights. But as I said because the women in church office fight Part of why this fight is threatening Protestantism as such and again, I hear you Roman Catholics and Orthodox cheering Is because Does sort of the Protestant way of dealing with? The multi-factor spiritual authentication. Does it really work? That's that's still a very open question for Protestants and a lot of Roman Catholics and Orthodox look over the fence and say no It doesn't work. Look at you Over here on the Protestant side of the fence. I look over at the Roman Catholic the Orthodox I say All right, I see our weaknesses but you got some of your own there too, so I'll get to that Like really to the end of the video if you'll ask that long now most of the looky-loos have left so It's mostly just us now I've been really enjoying this book by James Wellman jr. Tripp's uncle Funny how these things happen high on God. I don't know how much I like this title How mega churches won the hearts of America? That's a good subtitle the beginning of the book part one, I might read a lot of this book in the courses of my videos because This so today I just released my conversation from yesterday with John Verveke and JP Marceau and Often when I'm in those conversations, I feel like the guy who has to translate for regular folks, but that's what pastors do so Because you know JP and John Verveke can be up off there in the stratosphere You know put throw Peugeot in there and they're just Talking ancient fathers and philosophy and all these things way the heck up there and everybody's a lot of people's eyes just clave over Yeah, I know there's Nate Heil out there and he's eating it with a spoon Not everybody reads that much philosophy in history So I don't read as much of them, but I don't know as much as them But I try to be a little helpful in translating and there's a lot of translating that actually needs to be done in Wellman's book and And if there's that's a that's a critique I have of the book actually that You know a book like this is sort of pitched to a general audience. I Don't think this book is terribly accessible to a general audience, but it's accessible enough to me. But let's get started. I Mean caught my attention right away when part one the title of part one is desires the heart of religion Now there's a lot in there especially because this week I'm preaching on The second kind of the last the last part of the argument in the book of Galatians So if you're following on my sermons The my Sunday sermon went particularly well up better than the first draft and John Van Donk was in church And he he said he liked my sermon he says normally you're just sort of a moderate preacher But this was a really good one So if you're curious about how the sermon went I haven't cut it out of the service and posted it separately But you can go over the you can go over to the church YouTube Links below the church YouTube page and if you don't like the music just scroll through the music It's it's easy to find where I start preaching, but I thought the sermon went well Anyway desires the heart of the religion Why do I say desire sort of strange because if you read the Apostle Paul this desire is often a problem You hear that in Peugeot that you know, it's our it's our sinful desires. It's but Desire as such and Christianity is not a bad thing. And of course Augustine knew this Even John Piper knows this, you know desiring God is the name of his first book that really put him on the celebrity pastor map Desire is a big thing We're not human beings without desire and again and then Augustinian frame Desire is all about desiring the right things and not the wrong things ordered desires and you can hear that from Peugeot and for a moment Catholics, it's pretty desires the heart of religion and and you don't you don't commit to Religious communities are not built without desire and they're desiring something That's in many ways the heart of this video and why marriage equality I think means death to the Protestant churches Because in some ways I think they destabilize Protestant churches in such a way that the kinds of facts that we're seeing again This isn't the only variable in the decline of the mainline But the kinds of effects that we see happening the way mainline churches are playing out in America I think is partly due to this because anybody who is A pastor in a church knows marriage issues relational issues, I mean if there's one thing that Traditional Christians struggle with its sexuality should come as no surprise And again the answer of the culture sort of us then get out get then give up your strictures we're gonna deal with that later in this video because That isn't happening the governor of New York resigned Don't talk to me about giving up strictures We're inventing rules around sexuality at an enormous clip because We sort of abandoned one rule and so now You know One good rule is more than a thousand weak ones anyway back to this desires the heart of religion in part one In part one we will make the case that desire for emotional energy and again some of the language in this book Is that really the right word? But but he's trying to talk about really difficult things in this book and again He's trying to do it in an accessible way and that is really really hard and so You know if there's one thing that I do in my videos It's try to come up with language to talk about things that are really difficult to talk about So we make the case that desire for emotional energy is at the heart of religion Now again, I don't think that's a great sentence, but I think he's right Because I think I know what he's pointing to and I don't necessarily have a better sentence than his right now But I want one and if I talk long enough, I hope I'll get one so Humans seek emotional energy I get emotional energy And this energy is the drug or force that catalyzes sociality Again, I think he's right. I just don't like the language. He's using I don't think it I don't think it really I don't think it really grabs I mean, what did Peterson do Peterson had the right words at the right time that just exploded? That's what the right words will do. That's how important it is to look for the right words That's what theologians do all the time As do authors This force feeds humans fundamental needs again They're fundamental needs and this is where we're gonna get into Peterson Because these are fundamental needs we can't live without them You can you can live without creature comforts far quicker that you can live without these and you know meaning is in that group Again this isn't and and this is sort of the weakness of of an individual society And then he uses Durkheim and I think this is really really helpful and This sums up the problem of homo duplex human Humanity is a problem of homo duplex And I think that's a very important point that he's made And I think that's a very important point that he's made And I think that's a very important point that he's made And that sums up the problem of homo duplex human human human's desire to be independent masters of their own universe Sui generis individuals And that's sort of the sui generis from you know, that's sort of the secret sacred self That's that vision that the down inside of me. There's a there's a secret sacred self If I could somehow fully manifest in my life, then the kingdom comes then um, then i'm in heaven then I've arrived i've achieved i've then then we're then we've arrived at the summa bonum the greatest of all goods That's sort of the the cult of the secret sacred self But they desperately need to do this in and through others and this is why Churches and and and people in churches demand that their churches reflect back to them mirror back to them Their positions And and it fuels youtube You know, I I look at I look at youtube channels that Maybe i'll maybe i'll name names I look at youtube channels that well Not this channel Something like this channel um alisa childer alisa childers now some of you really like her channel i'm sure because there's some alignment between my positions and her positions, but This video was through and oh discerning the popular christian podcast in the country positives and cautions and I find these channels dull boring. Why because they're so Completely predictable, but yet they're really popular. Well, why are they really popular and If I was a little bit more Right down the line along certain evangelical or cultural or dogmatic lines My channel could be more popular, but I keep saying things that Annoy you and i'm like a bionic mosquito buzzing around you except i'm not talking about natural law I wanted to get bionic mosquito in the video somehow And so that's part of the reason my channel skews because if people who hang with my channel are usually pretty high in openness so You know, she just has this video about marcel and she runs through all the pretty common pedestrian points and fair enough make a video but people eat this stuff up because it's like I mean, it's part of the reason why jordan jordan peterson rose is because he was saying things better than people could and so What was happening is they were they were getting mirrored back to them What they already believed but it was sort of like a an improvement mirror where they looked prettier in the mirror Through the words of the other person than they felt themselves to be And that's what these channels that's what many channels like this do and you know fine, i'm just not interested in that because After i've heard one or two of her videos I can almost guess although I was a little bit super she she identified it as a complementarian but she said that like the christian reform church that that's kind of kind of the moderate evangelical posture that You know women in church office is sort of something of adiaphora Which means you can be one way or another and still sort of be within the overton window of what is acceptable so But the reason I don't watch a lot of channels like this is because they don't give me anything new and I like new things so again nothing against her channel, but I it's it's they They fulfill the function and they derive their audience from the Improvement mirror see this is why I do this to come up with language from sort of the improvement mirror approach Which generates a lot of church commitment? Because in a consumer society with voluntary organizations people select churches that do that for them among other things so Yeah Because again back to this The sum of the problem of homo duplex human desire on humans desire to be independent I gotta be me masters of their own universe sui generis individuals But they desperately need to do to do this in and through others And the process of achieving this cooperation Effective energy and again, that's really good technical language, but I think it'll go over the whole over the heads of most Readers unless you've read maybe some jonathan edwards and or some john piper Learned about jonathan edwards the affect Effective energy produced which penetrates and swirls between bodies creating literal bodies in the context of a worship service quite literally a drug-like experience now Now that language gets our attention Because drugs are a big deal, but almost anyone will tell you You know the drugs on the outside getting them into the inside it's because our experiences are made up of drugs that are already in there and the drugs outside just sort of blunt force the experience in our head, which is why i'm I don't think psychedelics. I'm skeptical about psychedelics. I'm not going to go back down the psychedelic Route i've got videos on that you can watch them and An experience that has in one form or another sustained humans in groups across time and tradition I think he's exactly right. He is exactly right and what he does in the book is he points out Actually mega churches are really effective Drug Are really effective drug delivery systems I remember One of one of my friends who was planting a church here in sacramento He was starting his church in a movie theater and I looked at that theater I said this is gonna this is gonna make it really hard for your people to bond Together as a body because movie theaters are very intentionally very skillfully designed To even though you're with a crowd of people to make you feel alone The lights are low the stage is bright There's a central focus These are all psychotechnologies And they're powerful psychotechnologies and and so, you know, we all have our little shipping and so at some point I I want i'm gonna bring I want to talk i'm gonna have a I want to have a conversation with james wellman again I don't usually do that with authors Or I usually not terribly excited about doing that with authors But I have a conversation with james wellman and john vervecki because I think those two could have an interesting conversation anyway Because basically what he describes in the book is how mega churches are powerful psychotechnologies to deliver Drugs, but they're not outside drugs. They're drugs inside our head and that's part of the reason I think psychedelics are sort of a cheat because Now let's say Let's say you because you could become a master at meditation By taking a pill Would you take it a lot of people say? Yeah. Well, let's say I could You know bulk up with muscles far quicker By You know taking a particular drug while I lift weights than just lifting weights alone. You say oh, yeah, we all know that that's steroids Yeah There are other effects to steroids, too So Unearned wisdom be careful of unearned wisdom. So Jordan peterson and danica patrick I was beginning to wonder if I was done with jordan peterson I came back from vacation and didn't really have any desire to listen to any of his more recent conversations Now I don't say that in a way that like, you know some Someone in a romantic relationship i'm done with you. No, not at all. Not at all anything like that It just and I know many of you have had the same thing because he was told me He's kind of mapped territory It's kind of getting repetitive kind of getting decadent Don't listen too much jordan peterson anymore because he's kind of doing the same thing saying the same thing yada yada yada And he talked to danica patrick and it was on her channel Now why danica patrick just because she's hot No, she is hot but No, that's not why because Actually my interest in danica patrick Came through my interest in aaron rogers Well, what was my interest in aaron rogers? Well, first it was fantasy football because Aaron rogers an amazing quarterback And then I caught this news and Oh, let's see. It was earlier. Um, yeah Aaron rogers got real about religion. He did so in danica patrick's podcast and then it was and I almost I don't I don't think I made a video about it But I almost did because of course those of you watch my channel know that deconstruction is part of this story And actually deconstruction is very much part of the story about why marriage equality is death to protestant churches Because any deconstruction story you hear in the west almost everyone will include The issue of homosexuality why? I'm not really to the bottom of that one yet, but That's a huge issue for these people Huge issue for these people you hear it almost every time ret and link Um almost all the celebrities it's it's this issue Like that's it's this is a really big deal and I agree it's a big deal. It's a tough one. It's really hard and I'm not going to get too far into that in this video But I want to deal with that at some point in a video and some of you know who watch my videos You might have to wait a long time until I actually do but we'll see but Aaron rogers grew up in a traditional Christian conservative family And he deconstructed and because My daughters have been home instead of sons and we've been watching shows like the bachelor and the bachelorette I know that aaron rogers has a brother What was his name jordan jordan rogers? And jordan rogers won jojo's heart In one season of the bachelorette And they haven't married yet or maybe they have marriage yet just recently So the dirty little secret about the bachelorette is that it doesn't usually work But and then jordan rogers often in that episode would talk about how There's a riff in his family that Somehow their more famous older brother who was aaron Is kind of moved away from the family. That's a very sad thing That's a very sad thing And as a father now of a whole bunch of 20 somethings you know, we've got lots of different opinions about lots of different things, but to I it would break my heart To to have any of my children estranged from the family I Emotionally that that's harder on me than just about anything So I've listened to three episodes of her podcast the aaron rogers one and The jordan peterson ones And So then when jordan peterson was on her channel, I thought this could be interesting so I listened in now. I did a little bit more research right before this video because I didn't know if Rogers and patrick were still together. They're not And this is actually going to be not between those two But this is actually going to be part of my point Because what we're really dealing with is a stable ideal An archetypal a stable archetypal ideal and one of the things I learned from jordan peterson was Because archetypes are the kinds of things you can't get around because they've reached the limit That's the arc a two posts That's where the word archetype comes from it comes from the Greek arc a which means first or foremost or top or head And two posts type example. So this is the ultimate example And we're going to get into that marriage formula but So eventually on my crc voices pot writing This idea emerged That traditional marriage is an archetypal ideal that functions within churches and Well, what are churches? Well again go back to This book churches allow this churches engage this homo duplex need where We need to be individuals and we need to be in community and the complex dynamic between the individual and the and the community Is foundational for human existence And you if once you recognize that you see it all the time and all over the place So Oh shoot, I didn't put the link in So I started listening to the danica patrick podcast with jordan peterson knowing now One of the things i've been talking about on twitter is buzzwords are holy words Maybe we'll start at the beginning of the podcast because she's laying down her buzzwords and her buzzwords are Basically articulating her religious devotion What is her religion what is at her core Let's let's listen This podcast Exists because I love talking to people and I love going deep the purpose is to plant seeds of inspiration Oh, okay Buzzwords are holy words plant seeds of inspiration Now now you're you're you're playing with the religious liturgy here now. We it isn't necessarily connected with um a lot of the ways that people identify religion, but That's how it's functioning in her world. I gotta check the sound level of this video We enter a space of vulnerability and relatability and Vulnerability relatability now. It's really interesting. I'm not going to play any of it, but her if you go back through her archives and Check out her conversation with then boyfriend erin rogers all of her buzzwords come up. She has implicit within her As we all do you need it we need this religious assumptions presuppositions in fact some way to deal with Homo duplex, you know, we're gonna get got that from wellman and durkheim this this both the the the me us Tension and Now there's lots of other things built into this but All of these buzz buzzwords that's that she's spinning out. Those are those are her holy words. Okay What you realize is that we are so much more alike than we are different to quote homo duplex Oh ramdas. We're all just oh quoting ramdas. I I see people sometimes say Have you read any ramdas? No, I haven't Have not should I I don't know. There's a lot of people I should read so i've not read any ramdas but He's located in my imaginary sort of at the new age I mean Living in northern california is just associated with a whole picture I have of friends of mine who I know where they're at sort of on a religious spectrum and they read ramdas. So she's quoting from him Just walking each other home and the show is just one step I'm danica patrick walking so much more alike than we are different to quote ramdas We're all just walking each other home and the show is just one step so Holy words are buzzwords buzzwords are holy words. I'm danica patrick and i'm pretty intense Today on the show is someone that I am so so excited about I have been listening to His talks and his information for so long His name is dr. Jordan peterson. He's a professor of psychology a clinical psychologist Is jordan peterson more famous than danica patrick? I don't know you tell me and author of best-selling books 12 rules for life an antidote to chaos And now he has beyond order 12 more rules for life so Clearly we need a lot of rules for life because there's still life is really If you lose foundational rules rules multiply and not in a good way challenging and that's A lot of what we talked about is just how hard it is how complicated it is And then we get into self-awareness, which I think is just a huge thing to Self-awareness holy words are buzzwords. Excuse me buzzwords are holy words become self-aware of something going on facing I think we all want to get better, but it's a matter of how okay get better see then now Okay, now we're rebel wisdom chris williamson in secular society, we want to get better, but Do we have an idea of we definitely have ideas about better and worse But it's all a little fuzzy. It's all a little foggy and where do those ideas come from? How do we figure out where we need to get better? Where are our blind spots? How do we figure it out? He's a fascinating human if you've never heard of him Get ready. He's a straight down the barrel kind of guy and I think you're gonna like this now, of course I think i'm correct in this because i'm not a nascar fan either. I mean she she came to fame by being a a female race car driver And they're unusual So she's I mean she's well and she's also extremely marketable because of her looks But she was also a good driver. I assume I don't know. I mean someone in the comment will tell me but No, I guess you retire from race car driving at some point and so now she's doing podcasts and You know make money as a celebrity so She's doing podcasts but it was very interesting that her conversation with with with aaron rogers was very interesting because they were dating and She's Wow. Hi jordan. How are you? Hi dedica. How are you doing? I'm good. Eh I've got some uh Cheap canadian jokes. I have uh, I have relatives that live in canada, so i'm familiar with the canadian accent I love the canadians And people really do say a all the time. Oh, yeah, they do. Yeah and a boot. It's really true. Well, I can't hear that Sounds like about to me People say it isn't so And she she must be from the american south because if you live in a place like michigan canadians are not that exotic Sorry canada Thank you for the invitation Oh Thank you for doing it. This is um, I don't think there's been an interview that I have been more excited about or prepared as much And my preparation is not really like I want to know if she read maps of meaning and understood it Because that's a hard book Hasn't been just all the like since I knew we were doing this I have been paying attention to your work and listening to you and watching youtube videos for Years and years and I just think that you're brilliant I think that you are You have such an I have no idea when this was recorded Fairly recently he looks pretty good sort of the peterson watch, you know, how's how's he doing you look for little signs? Incredible scope one of the things that's so amazing is how you are able to layer in so many different Sources whether it's religion or mythology or psychology And you just blend them also comprehensively when you answer a question And I just I just think it's it's brilliant How how are you able how are you able to take all of those sources and blend them together? so smooth well My mind works in a theoretical way. I would say I was talking with two psychologists yesterday steven pinker and jonathan height and height Seems to think like me he he has a kind of a master theory in some sense and then he just plugs things into it Whereas pinker remembers facts. He has an amazing memory. He's he's like a I I really like this question and I really like this answer. That's why i'm playing it It's not terribly on topic, but I thought it was really good He's like an encyclopedia and i'm not like that like facts themselves don't really stick with me I have a theory about things and I just plug new pieces of information into it all the time and it's one big story And so I kind of know the story I guess that's the right and that's how I think and so If a topic elicits part of that theory and that's and that's part of why he's such a good presenter because He tells it as a story and again story is this Enormous compression engine and we're deeply wired and attracted to it Which i've been writing about and lecturing about for you know, 30 years Then I have something to say about it. I think it's I think it's something like What jazz musicians do? They have all sorts of riffs and tricks that they have stored up and then they can improvise with them As needs be and that seems to be how I think and how I lecture Well, i'm always trying to build this theory and cover new territory with it and to make it more comprehensive Well, what's the what's that theory? I started out with a great answer great question and this question is like Uh, I just said i've spent my entire life long working on this and I gotta get it down. Oh boy Well I suppose in essence, it's it's a it's a theory about the story that we Look at the world through but first of all the theory is that we do look at the world through a story and You know people are very very attracted to stories, right children will beg for a story so there's something very Particular about stories that compel us and I mean it's odd if you think about it will pay to go watch a story Doesn't matter if it hurts our feelings. It doesn't matter if it makes us anxious or upsets us any of those things It doesn't matter We're still so enthralled by it that we'll go Expose ourselves to it. So stories must be extremely useful to us unless he is so different in this conversation than this conversation with verveky, I mean just It's just night and day difference Just write that off as mere entertainment, which I don't think is very smart and A story is about going from Where you are to somewhere better usually And then about the catastrophes that might befall you along the way the unexpected occurrences and how those might resolve and How that might change you the way you look at the world the way you interact with other people Either for the better or the worse better if it's a comedy and worse if it's a tragedy And so i've been trying to unpack What a story is A simple story is just a child might tell it I went to kindergarten today You know More complicated story is I went to kindergarten today But on the way a mean dog barked at me and I got real upset and I thought maybe I'd go home But I decided to continue Then you pat the child on the head and say well that was a good decision Right that you stuck with your course despite the fact that you got waylaid by something frightening And so the first story is a I called it a normal story in my first book and the second story a revolutionary story and so Exodus in the old testament is a revolutionary story right because The israelites is he working on exodus? one can only hope leave the jews leave the tyranny egypt And escape into freedom, but then everything falls apart into chaos And then at least in principle they find their way again and move forward It's a very powerful story that'll probably give us a little signal into what he'll do with exodus I think he just actually just laid it out right there in terms of how he looks at exodus mythologically or psychologically How can we know? Because so many of these stories whether they're from you know ancient egypt or Like I went to egypt earlier this year and hearing the story interesting She didn't want to say the bible I don't think because again now well, why are we why are we in this? Why are we talking about why are we watching this woman when we're talking about marriage equality? Well, because I suspect I don't know and if some of you are danica patrick podcast fans You'll probably tell me in the comment section that She and erin rogers and many others who have grown up in The united states deeply impacted by protestantism Have made this journey which for them feels like moral improvement into a Position of embracing and in fact even demanding from our government marriage equality And For many people that's reason enough to look at the bible and say you know if the bible got this wrong again This is a new atheist trope If the bible got this wrong, why does it have any credibility for you at all? That's a powerful argument that argument has That argument has gone a long ways. And so what what groups that are highly motivated like church groups? To evolve on this point because culturally it's such a defeater Have have tried to do then is go to the bible and say we're going to find a biblical justification for same-sex marriage now It's really difficult to not imagine and i'll put on my new atheist shirt instead of my pineapple bombs And and say that sounds a lot that sounds really post-hoc that sounds like a sunk cost issue for you because basically if If there is deep within you a some a religious kernel, I mean that in terms of software A religious kernel that is operating And that one of the things that gets manifest is marriage equality marriage equality marriage equality is just obvious on the basis of this particular religious Presupposition that's really hard to know what those religious presuppositions are what those ideals are underneath because there are many many ideals beneath us fighting for supremacy or I can flip it as in my conversation with vervecki and And And jp there are many many spirits above who are moving us like an iowa cornfield Because as I said in the vervecki thing The plants in the iowa cornfield, how much do they know about the farmer? But they're just being plants The farmer's dog in the iowa cornfield. How much does the farmer's dog know about the farmer a little bit more? But if you think about what a dog can know and how a dog might know and what consciousness might know might look like in a dog Not a lot The farmer knows way more about the dog and the plant than the plant knows about the farmer or the dog knows about the farmer So there's a religious kernel underneath that's and that's energized and it's and it's basically saying marriage equality is just obvious And I think many of us not all of us. I certainly do I that I i've got that religious kernel Actively in me. It's been said in me by my culture and I say yeah you know why you know because I love my wife and you know, I want to stay married to my wife until death do us part and You've got same-sex attracted people. Why on earth would you rob them of? the opportunity to know love and and to and to Enjoy life now. You can't really I figured this out when I was writing on voices, too You can't really use the word monogamous or you're going to be into the patriarch patriarchy why mono It's it's monogamous means one woman Monogamy is the wrong word. It's pair bonding for life something like that, but So A big part of the deconstruction my guess and I might be wrong My guess for many people like Aaron Rodgers Danica Patrick is marriage equality is just Obviously right and good and to deny it is wrong and offensive and and it's because Either you've got this position warring inside of you as some of you do I know because you tell me Others that just that's that's your position I and I have i've had many people say I simply cannot be part of a church that does not embrace marriage equality I Understand that I get that but now It's interesting again She said well egypt now you really mean the bible because when he said exodus the force of that is not egypt It's the bible and it's the authority of the bible and the value of the bible And again if there's one thing jordan peterson did was turn a whole bunch of people on to the idea that the bible has value And maybe even beyond value authority Now part of the reason i'm playing this here is because what jordan is about to do And part of the reason i've been interested in jordan peterson right from the start Is I want to know how jordan does what he does and the only way i'm going to know how jordan does what he does And jordan might not even be able to tell me exactly how he does what he does at least not in Every way that could be told in the manner of a sentence or a paragraph or even necessarily a book because we're that complex But I want to know how jordan does what he does and I want to know it not just propositionally I want to know it procedurally I want to know it. I want to be able to participate in it Some of you see the verveki 4p shining through there and What he does right here and what's to come? is I mean, he's so practiced at it That that's when you find a master and this is why You know if someone offers you a pill to achieve for you what? years of meditation Maybe you would achieve through that and you can get it through a pill don't take the pill why You don't know what that pill is going to do for you. Just like If I if that pill will help me achieve in the gym In a year what it would take 10 years for me to achieve in the gym will tend, you know Don't take the pill Your voice will get high So Just in these next few minutes jordan peterson very subtly exhibits What he's such a master of and and you might say well What exactly is it? See we're not sure because it's all sort of happening beneath the surface But he does it right here and when I watched this first part. It was like That's why I paid attention to this guy I know a lot of you say you only you only make videos about jordan peterson to Get attention on youtube There are ways of getting attention on youtube using jordan peterson that I have clearly not used because That's not what i'm interested in i'm interested in learning And actually being able to do what jordan peterson does But that's really hard And and it's not just imaginative a matter of doing it performative I want to do it Authentically, which means that I need to integrate What jordan peterson has mastered into My already well-baked cake my already well developed matrix And that's really hard. That's a lot harder than just Duplicating jordan peterson performatively, but well what he's about to do here is it and so well, how does this deal with my Is it and so well, how does this deal with marriage equality? Well, i'm gonna get there Okay Just watch what he does now now first of all he set up so she asked this question and that's vital Stories in egypt because so many of these stories very powerful story How can we know? Right there. How can we know? I want to know the truth I want to know it's real I want to know I want to have knowledge so that I can I can what I can achieve I can I mean she started off the podcast with Again buzzwords are holy words. She started off the cast podcast with buzzwords. She wants You know again, we're back to this fight over this word. We're back to theosis She wants union with god that's what she wants And and look at where she's looking right now How can I know how can because jordan i've had glimpses that you might be someone who can help me That's why i'm looking at jordan. You can help me learn some things jordan can help me achieve some things now I don't want to be racked with The the the physiological consequences of benzo withdrawal But you clearly have some ideas that I need to know about and again I think these ideas have everything to do with why marriage equality means death To many protestant churches Oh Because so many of these stories whether they're a story How can we know? Because so many of these stories whether they're from, you know ancient egypt or Like I went to egypt ancient egypt. It's so funny because I saw someone posted on one of my listservs about Trouble in the netherlands over the the royal coach, which is all made of gold and how that reminds everyone of slavery Shouldn't the pyramids of egypt remind everyone of slavery? Let's cancel the pyramids But but no the bible the bible the bible, but egypt Arche tuples Arche first foremost head I'm not going to talk about the bible. I want to talk about egypt Spirituality something non-exclusive Egyptians weren't exclusive Earlier this year and hearing the stories about osiris and isis and Horus and all of these different stories but that or religious even from the time that jesus was around when they opening the door a little bit You know put you know wrote these stories down Many many decades later Many many decades later What what really do you know? How how up to date are you on the question of? the new testament gospels and Inscripturation just answer for me the question of Was the temple of jerusalem still up when those were written what form redaction? I mean, these are really complex questions How how do we know? There it is again. How do we know look where she's looking same thing? If the story is real Ah real there's that word now again jordan's jordan Plays this Again, this is what he's a master at I mean, he's so he's so used to it It doesn't even he he'd probably do this in his sleep because memory is poor Well, I think That's a very very complicated problem. Obviously, I mean some forms of truth are factual Scientific truths are factual other sorts of truths you act out And you see if they were ah now we're into verveky 4p knowledge truth. What is truth work? and so They're true In the sense that an arrow is true when it flies or someone's heart is true right, there's lots of variations of the idea of truth and so christian story posits a ideal at its center that's the story of christ and and everything about him and The truth of that is to be Discovered in action as far as I can tell acting it out. It's a target for emulation and imitation Okay Acting out now now if he'd come in this thing with a what would jesus do bracelet on him I don't think she'd have him on the podcast but Oh jordan coming right in under the radar dropping these I mean, there's just so much in that little answer that just opens things up and he just he delivered it perfectly here It's not so much a description of Objective reality, although it might also be that but And so To believe it is to act it out that kind of ethic Part of what christianity is is a discussion about what constitutes the ideal That we should all act out that unites us around right it Homoduplex it unites us. It's it's the individual and it's the ideal it unites us. It has to be acted out And that ideal and it also that we should all act out that unites us around that ideal And it also structures our expectations it unites us around that ideal because that unites us around that ideal and it also structures our expectations because We're disappointed in ourselves and in other people Whenever we don't manifest that ideal All right, your conscience bothers you you feel guilty you feel ashamed because you're not Now he's he's making it very Phenomenological he's making it very psychological Because she can relate to this and now if you if you weighed in No, I don't want to give I don't want to throw stones at tim keller here because him having this conversation with Kevin deyoung was was very much framed and tim keller can I mean part of what tim keller's skill was was doing similar things to jordan here But jordan just comes right in under the radar and he's he's laying the foundation for saying Hey, wait a minute We're all pursuing an ideal And we're all trying to figure out what that ideal is. That's that's the question you asked And and these ideals are deep beneath the surface. They're well They're built into our imaginations. In fact, they've been built into the the the ideal in the movie theater where my friend tried to plant a church was deliver a particular Experience alone together in a particular way and and everything about the architecture of a movie theater is about that And and church architecture now if you're in a mega church You're sort of doing that alone together thing, but then you have small groups and I talked about that with trip, but There's so much that jordan is laying down here. He is planting seeds that when these things germinate Stuff changes Conscious we don't manifest that ideal Right. Your conscience bothers you you feel guilty you feel ashamed because you're not Putting forward your ideal self That ideal, you know people have been trying to sort out what that ideal is for a very long time there and you know back to so as you haven't forgotten what this video is supposed to be about because I warned you right at the beginning how This road was going to be I always say Christianity both seeded our contemporary ideas of marriage equality and resist them because the ideal is love your neighbor and How will you love your gay neighbor? Will you deny your gay neighbor the the kind of? security Companionship You know satisfying sexuality that You know that heterosexual people enjoy how? unloving of you That's a powerful point. I again we wouldn't have be having a conversation about gay marriage without Christianity So certainly the Egyptians you talked about part of their ideal was isis Horus Osiris they all represented different elements of existence Osiris was the god of the state Essentially he was willfully blind and was defeated by his evil brother Seth that happens to states all the time that Malevolent forces take them over when they're willfully blind Horus Horus Happens to churches too. This is the Egyptian eye And everyone knows that symbol still which is quite amazing given that it's thousands of years old and Horus is the god who pays attention So the Egyptians worshiped attention as the force that revitalized the old state Now this video was definitely after Peugeot's video But pay attention to attention and this is a big theme of petersons It's not a theme that gets a lot of attention, but he makes it in his maps of meaning classes And it's brilliant it's different than thought Attention, right? That's the point he makes often whether it's maps of meaning or his personality that thought and attention have an interesting relationship attention is Reception it's being willing to see what's in front of your eyes Mm-hmm. And so the Egyptians figured out took them a long long time Being willing to see what's it's more than that. It's It's also desire It's desiring to see what's in front of your eyes and that There was something divine about the capacity to pay attention something that would redeem the blind state So, you know all the second time he's had to fight back a year back a year All of us are inheritors of a cultural tradition It's functional In the us that's embodied I suppose in the constitution but the constitution is dead except insofar as it's Embodied in living people who are paying attention Right. So the Egyptian pharaoh was a combination of osiris and horus. It's a brilliant idea Hey, so that meant that he was the tradition that had founded the state Plus the capacity to pay attention And renew the state yeah, yeah, yeah, and they figured out that that was the central idea the central element of appropriate sovereignty Right because you might say well, would it be brute force? Would it be power? There's lots of accusations about that today that Cultural institutions are basically predicated on power. That's wrong It's it's a it's a it's a terrible way to think it's I mean they they are predicated on power when they become corrupt But you know everyone you know who's corrupt uses power No one that no one that Is behaving according to the ideal? Uses force to get their way and it's not very efficient anyways makes you unpopular It makes you a target It's unstable socially It's unsophisticated doesn't even work well for children doesn't work well for Animals for that matter often So it might not maybe it's not even that this whether the story's right or not. It's a Maybe it's I mean when you listen to it what's going on in her mind with respect to This follow-up question right or wrong is the bible right or wrong or these religious stories right or wrong because I'm just out there with my holy buzzwords and and making stuff up and vulnerability and authenticity and and and ramdas and And and ramdas and and you know, i'm i'm a religious consumer out there Being my authentic self choosing my things and taking things that that are salient to me and putting them together and that's that's how That's how we can coct our religion, especially if we're not deeply embedded in a Disciplined religious tradition Be more maybe it's not even that this whether the story's right or not. It's a maybe more of a guideline. It's more it's more Archetypal I don't want the american government to have laws. I want them to have guidelines I want them laws on everybody else but guidelines for me, please. Thank you typal kind of It's more Archetypal kind of she's been listening to jordan peterson hasn't she? But this whether the story's right or not, it's a maybe more of a guideline. It's more it's more Archetypal kind of Stories that help guide us and maybe it doesn't even matter if they're real what matters is that we're using them to Be better to have good ideals to better real real is a tricky business in some sense, you know because abstract things can be more real than concrete things like Numbers, for example are very abstract, but they're real enough so that if you can manipulate them you can change the world And you know if we if you read deep literature A deep literature is In some sense a distillation of character Right. I mean no one would want to read just about your day if you describe every detail Right, you sort of pull out what's interesting and relevant and and and essential And so these stories are in some sense essential And so they're true in that they're abstractions. That's how I look at it now that leaves open The relationship between them and what we would normally consider historical truth And there's tremendous amount of debate about that. I certainly don't have the answer to that but You know, there's an idea for example Common idea that christ is the king of kings Well, so you imagine that You abstract out of people what would make someone noble Right, so you look at noble features across a bunch of Across a assortment of different people you think well there I could make a noble character Then you take all those noble characters and you take the most noble element of them and you say that's a king Then you take a group of kings and you say what's most kingly? You abstract out that Right, so that's that's part of the idea Now people like carl jung and cs lewis believed that It was interesting that he paired both of them here Now people like carl jung and cs lewis believed that They believed that christ acted out that archetype that king of kings and so there was a union between the historical reality and the abstraction And so, you know, we don't know what would happen if an ideal person came into existence Perhaps nothing. I mean we don't know do we? but Is that maybe not even the point? I i've again. I mean, I mean what's what's This is this is a master class of what peterson is doing here because he is he is He is he is shaking the foundations of her deconstruction because the point tim keller makes often is that You don't really just deconstruct what you really do is you piece together a different system Because a lot of times sort of secularity wants to say we're going to get rid of all of this religious artifice as if it can be a religion free zone and keller and Dutch calvinist and a lot of people basically It's not really what you're doing it's just an alternative system It's not the absence of a system and and so peterson is peterson is pushing back against a lot of these holy buzzwords That that she's been using to construct the system and and and he's testing them and she's You know, this is all very polite and welcoming and all this stuff, but works being done here really do we but Is that maybe not even the point i've really thought about this. Is that not the point? Maybe even of being here in this Human existence do we need is do we need the polarity? Do we need the sides? Do we need the contrast? Like if there was an ideal person Does that even work here? If you believe jesus is an ideal person Read the gospels and pay attention to whether or not people liked him Because that's key because deep in this american idea is that when If if if something really true and really right was in front of it we would recognize it and love it Read the prologue to the gospel of john the new testament is very skeptical And it says no, we'd probably hate it why Because we love our system Because it's ours this goes all the way back to genesis 3 That's a good question. I mean we do seem disappointed when people don't live up to the ideal that we expect But by the same token, we tend to love people Even sometimes for their faults certainly despite them So ideal guides us along and judges us all the time You know you you work towards a better self at least to some degree you have some conceptualization of that you're Excited when that works out and disappointed when it doesn't certainly with people you love although you do accept them in some sense the way they are You're disappointed When another young they aren't all they could be as far as you're concerned. That's particularly true probably of family members Perhaps that's particularly true of parents in relationship to their children You know and that's a funny question, you know when you love somebody do you love the ideal they could be or do you love them? Or both perhaps Because you want to encourage them you want to have have them grow towards something that's better And you know, we we're so attracted to Vulnerability and vulnerability implies perhaps a shortcoming right like something So vulnerability things I've been watching too much bachelor and I really I really love vulnerability. Do you really do you love that in your door lock? I don't think so Why do you love it and they go into it? But that's but but I wanted to make the point here that I listened to this and it was like wait a minute ideals attention what we love what we desire and Where then right away? I thought of a different conversation where Two people were dealing with these kinds of questions. I think at a deeper way and That was the conversation he had with Jonathan Pichot We aspire to ideals We don't necessarily Consciously embrace ideals and in fact it takes us a long time to be able to articulate the ideals that we possess That they're definitely working beneath the surface beneath or above they're definitely working on us, but We worship ideals we organize around ideals, I mean this is the point of The desire is the heart of religion and it's the individual it's homo duplex The desire is the heart of religion and it's the individual it's homo duplex it's back and forth The desire for emotional energy is at the heart of religion humans seek emotional energy and this energy is the drug or force That catalyzes sociality. In fact all of what it takes and now as a pastor I know what it takes to establish and maintain a religious institution and what a lot of what we've been seeing in the culture is the collapse of religious institutions mostly because they are abandoned and and this is a point that I make often with respect to People like to say well paganism was suppressed by tyrannical christian kings Well, you can certainly find examples of that But I think the historical record more illustrates that paganism was abandoned Abandoned And it was abandoned because people were opting they desired something else and they desired the church now again, this is that's over huge realms of time, but you know if you listen to tom holland talk about listen to his episode on the olympics They gave up on the olympics it was abandoned they didn't bother to organize it anymore and you say well Well, well watch what's happening to churches. The same thing is happening now Churches are abandoned look at my conversation about churches in quebec. They're abandoned living stones is you know abandoned in many ways now not by the Faithful who community be here, but it's abandoned by the culture what living stones is offering the community isn't buying And you know part of that's perhaps my fault but This is this is the way religions rise and fall And there are ideals that work deep beneath it and these ideals can either energize and motivate them or If the ideal is maintained and there's a disconnection between that and the environment the things collapse That's how this stuff works churches churches don't die often because they're suppressed in fact often Suppression helps motivate it because it's it's forbidden fruit. Well, if they're if they're If the government is so interested in shutting them up surely they must be saying something right I mean, we're all suspicious that way. We play those we play those games but Their ideals beneath the surface and we worship those ideals and we need groups in order to achieve those ideals Now the conversation that really got into this was jordan's conversation with jonathan So now look I mean look at jordan in this conversation this conversation That's back when they were putting the dates of the conversations on the podcast. They stopped doing that which is annoying to me Because i'm really nosy How could I not be nosy with a nose this big? But I mean jordan is is is Much less unwell when he spoke with when he spoke with jonathan but um We're doing Oops, I didn't even even had that link wrong Okay Okay, so here they're talking about this book by a couple of roman catholic scholars both that that book is out now I haven't read it. I've read I read the I read the sample the free sample on amazon And you know when I talked about the alice of children's video In some ways maybe I'll read the whole book at some point But in some ways that was the impression I got from the book that Well, jordan peterson is insufficiently roman catholic Duh I don't need to read a book to know that He's not roman catholic and and and and I've I've made you know that I want to be careful here because I've made plenty of videos He's he's insufficiently christian reformed He's not christian reformed at all What's interesting about it? I'm not so much interested in the ways that jordan peterson Necessarily fails to hit a mark that I have for him. I'm more interested in What he has to say that can help me understand the world better and those things are usually sort of outside My area of knowledge and expertise i'm interested in what he knows and what I don't and And a lot of where this goes is this question of ideals I would say Traumatically positive Yeah, and you wouldn't think that that would be possible really but I find it that way. I mean partly It's overwhelming to have people constantly Tell me in person Their responses to what i've been doing It's very emotional and I get caught up in that quite quickly And of course on youtube and the social media platforms youtube particularly the bulk of the comments About me are very very positive It's 99 to 1 often in terms of likes and dislikes it's yeah and and It's too much Well, I don't know how I don't know how to I don't know how to I don't know what category to put it in. I don't know how to conceptualize it I mean part of part of me the practical Part of course says well, I just happened to adopt a new technology at a time when it started to boom And fill the kind of niche that was empty in that technology at that time But in some sense that that doesn't really cut it, you know Because it doesn't have anything to do with the content and then I think well I have been dealing with these Well borderline religious issues. Well, certainly not just borderline. There's lots of religious people who seem to think that i'm dealing with religious issues and Well, and that's really what I wanted to talk to you about tonight so This book I mentioned earlier To talk about Disagreements with my conceptualization of christ, let's say and which and i'm not sure what that conceptualization is by the way exactly It's a mystery to me um, but But I can say some some concrete things about it and and that's not a small point and And that point is beneath a lot of these points that these conceptualizations are acting Within us among us around us above us again back to my conversation with jp and john vervecki about spirits We don't know So let's fess up to it But we want to know because we know it's important and so we explore and that's what he's doing here with his with his friend between friends I mean I certainly I I understand and appreciate the symbolic significance of the ideal human being And that finds its embodiment and I took these ideas in large part from jung and eric neumann that that christ is a Christ is at least a representation of the ideal Man, whatever that is and we we all interestingly enough. We all seem to have an ideal And we and that I or that ideal has us and and and that's I mean, that's a huge point We all have an ideal or that ideal has us us Right, and that's where it's very interesting to consider the role of conscience because Your conscience will call you out on your behavior And so it seems to function as something that's somewhat independent Or at least as something that you can't fully voluntarily control because if you could voluntarily control it Then you just tell the pesky little bastard to go away Or to pat you on the back continually Because there there must be few things in life more pleasurable than than being a fully committed narcissist To really believe that everything that you do is right and that you're a good person And I suppose if you could wave a magic wand and rearrange your mind so that it was constantly telling you that You do it, but you don't seem to be able to do that in relationship to your conscience It trips you up and so and so it tells you when you're not living up to Your own ideal and that means that you have an ideal and you don't even know what the hell it is But you certainly know when you transgress against it and I know that there's a strong line of christian thinking that's identified The conscience with divinity sometimes with christ inside Sometimes with the holy spirit And and there are a lot more people that do it I'll say naively And not in a pejorative way, but they do it That's that little voice that they listen to and people inside and outside the church and I think it's a pastor I mean I talk to regular people about their spiritual and religious experiences and they tell me these things and I You know over the years i've learned to keep my mouth shut and not correct them and just listen and learn that doesn't mean I don't have thoughts on it, but If you're the kind of pastor that keeps trying to clean up and correct everybody's theological language People shut up and only tell you what they think you want to hear and that's usually boring So i'm much more interested in listening to what they really think Those are very interesting conceptualizations, but you can think of them psychologically and you can even think about them biologically, you know To some degree because we're so social If we don't again back to dirkheim homo duplex manifest an appropriate moral reciprocity We're going to become alienated from our fellows and we won't survive and we'll suffer and die and we won't we certainly won't Find a partner and and have children successfully and so now Right there right there and we're going to talk about Mf 4l as it's kind of been reduced to in my video male female for life as an archetypal ideal Structure No other combination Achieves what that one does. It's an ideal We're going to talk about that but ideals are powerful and it's an archetypal ideal You can't get around it and we'll work through that math To some degree the conscience can be viewed as the voice of Reciprocal society within and that's a perfectly reasonable biological explanation, but But the thing is is the deeper you go into biology the more it shades into something that appears to be religious because you start analyzing the fundamental structure of the psyche itself and and It becomes something Well, it becomes something with a power with with a with a with a power that transcends your ability to resist it So, okay, so you can think about christ from a psychological perspective and the critic the critic My critic this particular critic that i've been reading Said well that that doesn't differentiate christ much from a whole sequence of dying and resurrecting mythological gods And of course people have made that claim In comparative religion joseph campbell did that and young to a lesser degree I would say but campbell did that but the difference and cs lewis pointed this out as well the difference between those mythological gods and christ was that There's a there's a representation of There's a historical representation of his of of his existence as well so so again now there's a little bit of anachronism going on here because In our culture at this point Danica patrick and aaron roger is included Whether they know it or not There's a christological ideal within the culture built into all sorts of things Things that christians may or may not agree with like loving your gay neighbor and saying I i'm gonna wave wave the rainbow flag because Marriage is happiness. We're gonna talk about what marriage is in our culture And it's unfair to exclude you because of your some innate orientation That's in a sense christ manifesting in an expression of let's call it marriage equality That's built in but it's built in a lot of different things and people might say no No, thank you to the bible and jesus and the gospel But all that stuff is deeply within and that's you know And a lot of that is the point of of tom holland and what what he's convinced me of in terms of his writing and his Podcast and all of that stuff. So all that stuff is functioning. So christ is the ideal man even for people who would say it isn't And he isn't i said well jesus and buddha and gandhi and ram das and no, yeah, yeah, yeah, but It's it's just us talking and and Christ is so deep in there that that something grabbed us a desire That's a desire for christ in a way That that has grabbed the civilization of christ and it's a desire for christ That that has grabbed the civilization and and so we want to have it manifest and so Some want to have it manifest in in rainbow flags and marriage equality And i'm not a skeptic of that that that's at work in there But again, we're gonna get to the argument We're not ready for it yet Now you can debate whether or not that's genuine You can debate about whether or not he actually lived and whether there's credible objective evidence for that But it doesn't matter. Okay, and then you get into the question of of truth as as physical congruence or physical mapping That's always this question that we have and and so he and danica patrick were you know, just on that briefly but physical correspondence Issues of historicity and there's there's real reasons in history I mean again a lot of the roman catholics and orthodox are like ah modernity could have done without it I don't think so. I don't think so. I think protestantism was inevitable. I think modernity was is inevitable As downstream from christianity, I don't think you get to it from the other places The not that christianity has a lock on physical correspondentism in terms of an idea of truth but That was I mean basically what the enlightenment was to try to do is Is ring out corruption now part of the problem with almost every anti-corruption Effort is because we're we're low resolution blunt force creatures and we break a lot of other things when we're trying to get rid of corruption so but So that's important and those questions are important but As peterson is is on to here Let those questions have their day But in terms of how human beings live and work You can't stop at those questions if you just stop at those questions You're going to be white you're going to have other corruptions You're going to be playing other tricks on yourself because you need this deeper level You need to get into and to get down deep inside or or far up above and figure what exactly is moving the fields the fields of corn in iowa In some sense because this well it does but There's a sense in which it doesn't matter because there's still a historical story And so what you have in the figure of christ is an actual person who actually lived plus A myth and in some sense christ is the union of those two things The problem is is I probably believe that but I don't know I don't i'm amazed at my own belief and I don't understand it like Because i've seen Sometimes The objective world And the narrative world touch You know, that's union synchronicity And i've seen that many times in my own life And so in some sense, I believe it's undeniable, you know, we have a narrative sense of the world For me, that's been the world of morality. That's the world that tells us how to act It's real like we treat it like it's real. It's not the objective world But the narrative and the objective world touch and the ultimate example of that in principle is supposed to be christ But I don't know what to that seems to me oddly plausible Yeah, but I still don't know what to make of it. It's too it partly because it's too terrifying a reality to Fully believe I don't even know what would happen to you if you fully believed it If you believed in the story of christ or if you believed that history and and let's say the narrative Make meat let's both I think I think you Because when you believe that you buy both those stories you believe that the narrative and the objective can actually touch Yeah, I mean we saw that you and I I mean this is a trivial example, but we had a when we were discussing We had a sequence of discussions around frog symbolism Four years ago, yeah, that was very bizarre to say the least You know and that was a trivial example relatively trivial example of the narrative world and the objective world coming together Didn't feel that trivial at the time well the way the way that I like to deal with this is that One of the things it it's already there in your thought it's already there in the way that you talk about reality, which is that One of the constitutive aspects of how reality unfolds and how it appears to us is something like attention Right. It's something there's a hierarchy of of manifestation because everything remember In the danica patrick the talk about attention. It's a big theme of peterson now. Peugeot is reminding peterson Attention attention is not thought Attention is different it's in some ways attention Is is a manifestation of desire? Thing that have that appears to us in the world Has a an infinite amount of details, right? It has an indefinite amount of ways that you could describe it that you could angles it by which you could analyze it and so Nonetheless, the world appears to us through these hierarchies of meaning, right? I always kind of use the example of a cup or a chair like a chair is is of just a multitude of things It's a multitude of parts. How is it that we can say that it's one thing? There's a there's a capacity we have to attend and this capacity we have to attend Is something like a co-creation of the world and so the world actually exists No chair is a good example because you know, you can try to define it objectively But you end up with beanbags and stumps and exactly they don't have anything in common while they're both made of matter You know for whatever that's worth. It's pretty pretty trivial level of commonality, but you can sit on them Yeah, and that's what you have. It's a mode of being which defines well, and that's so strange so many of our object perceptions are projected modes of being and so even the objective world is Ineluctably contaminated with its utility and it would enter therefore with morality Exactly. And so I think that that's the key The key is that once you understand that the world manifests itself through attention And that consciousness has a place to play in actually the way in which the world Reveals itself and so you can you can try to posit a world outside of that first-person perspective, but it's good luck It's it's a deluded activity Well, it's also it's very very difficult because you don't you you don't know what to make of something like time because time hasn't Ineradicably subjective element and duration which is different than time I mean time is kind of like the average rate at which things change but duration is something like the felt sense of that time and If you take away this objectivity, it isn't obvious what to do with time And I think physicists stumble over this all the time so to speak So and this is something that this this intermingling of value in fact was something that I never thought I never thought I made much traction with with harris with sam harris He he didn't seem to me to be willing to admit How saturated the world of fact is? Not willing to admit or couldn't see inevitably with value and I actually think he's denying the science at that point because For everything I know about perceptual psychology There's a great book called uh vision as a Oh god now, I can't remember the name of the books. That's memory trouble. I'll remember it. No worries The idea is that If that is true Then there are certain things which come out of that there are certain necessary, uh Things down the road from that that insight which is that attention plays a part in the way the world lays itself out um And that one of them and one of them is that the stuff that the world is made of is partly Something like attention something like consciousness and that has a pattern and that pattern is the same pattern as stories It just it's just it doesn't lay itself out exactly the same but things exist Can you see where this goes back to the danica patrick video in terms of story attention? With a pattern which is similar to stories. They have identities. They have centers. They have margins They have exceptions and that's how stories lay themselves out like so a story happens in time how an identity let's say uh is Broken down and then reconstructed you could say that that's basically the story of every story How something breaks down and is reconstructed and so that is a way for us to perceive Uh the identity of things and so if the world is made of this then It's actually It's actually our world our secular world, which is a strange aberration on how Reality used to exist for every culture and every time from the beginning of time Which is to take that for granted to take for granted that Something that they didn't call it consciousness but intelligence and attention are part of how the world lays itself out and it lays itself out in modes of being and one of the things that comes out of it is not only that but like you said It's not only that you have ideas but it's that ideas have you or that it's not only that you Engage in modes of being is that modes of being? Have you? and that recognition means that the first level of The first level of attention to that looks something like worship. It looks like celebration It looks like uh it It's like uh, the thing which makes now again, we're going to worship and we're talking about Protestant churches here and we're talking about it in the context of of wellman's high on god book Because we're talking about motivation for worship and so worship happens And when we're conscious of it happening and when we're conscious of its value We seek to do it But but again to do it alone is one thing to do it with others and this is a big part of wellman's book Is is so much better and so mega churches have in a lot of ways perfected the psycho technology of this But you know, let's let's be fair to Let's be fair to roman catholics and to orthodox They're they're using other psycho technologies and so, you know the orthodox with their and the roman catholics with their cathedrals And their pageantry, I mean it's all psycho technology that they're using in order to focus on worship And to and to do this thing. Oh, you know Together by myself. Yes, but together is better and so this is the homo duplex and it's all coming together and And what's happening when we're doing this is not only are we having imprinted in us? These ideals down deep beneath us, but we are also Developing a longing a desire to live out those values That's what we're doing in church. This is why politicians if there's a religious movement that is counter to a political aim You know doesn't like those churches don't like those churches. That's why you get a lot of carping about evangelical churches, even though According to many studies, you know The american people who identify as christians in the united states are sort of split right down the middle between the two parties Although that you know, everything's changing now with the rise of the unaffiliated and people who feel homeless because of one party or another but the I mean the evangelical the evangelical church has a you know at a fairly tight lock on certain aspects of this and so There's a lot of political hand-wring about it but but but these ideas come together in this and And we need groups in order to achieve these ideals and and we long to worship with each other and this is why You know Jordan and jonathan are friends and jonathan longs for jordan to join him in worship now you know They don't live in the same town and I don't know what church jonathan goes to but But you know they they want good things for each other and that's actually the basis of every conversation because we have something that we Think is true and good and beautiful And so we want to share it with someone else so that that they enjoy it too And and it's all of the working on all of these ideals together The let's say the national hockey league so successful Has more to do with celebration than just a bunch of guys on skates on a piece of ice, you know throwing a puck around There's a celebration of the purpose of that thing and it manifests itself Through a bunch of stuff which one is like a trophy that stands in the middle on the top of a bunch of on a stand And everybody looks at it and kisses it and and and so there's this this veneration Yeah, well and there's mascots and the hockey league example is very interesting because it's a it's a it's a social game and No, all the players Are they're attempting to aim right now if you didn't listen to my conversation with verveke and jp We got into some of the stuff there and I really enjoyed that conversation, right? So there's a symbolic element to that sin is Misplaced aim and so you hit the you hit the small space in the net Blocked though. It may be by your enemies And everyone celebrates that and you do that in cooperation with other people and in competition with other people and if you do it properly Not only are you a brilliant player from a technical perspective, but you're also a great sport And so there's an ethic there and a morality and and this is why people are so upset when hockey players or any other pro Athlete does something immoral in their personal life is because it violates the The ethic that that's being celebrated as a consequence of this great game. Okay right there That is that point Why should anyone care in church if the pastor is sleeping around It's the same point as the hockey player It's the same point as our interest in aaron rogers or danica patrick It's the same point that these games are not just mere games In our hearts and our ideals and our imaginary they fan out and they're they're enormous And so churches that want to say things like well We're not going to police sexuality. I have yet To see that and we're going to talk a little bit later about Oh, we don't really mean that we're not acting like we really believe that because Enforcing clergy sexuality has become an obsession In our culture in the roman catholic church and the protestant church and and people who are who are quickly ready to deconstruct point at pedophile priests and rabbi zachariah and bill hybels and You know one of the things that this podcast the rise and fall of marsil has not pointed out is that hey for all of For all of mark driscoll's failures He hasn't slept around to our knowledge That that's not a that's not an unimportant point in that whole conversation Because We there's there's there's an ideal at work deep beneath it that That that is that is working in the church and and and that and that gives desire and energy and motivation for people to To tie then to give their time and to give their offerings and to and to most of all give their attention to the church And and as jordan and and jonathan said here we see that in hockey You know, we we watch the the love lives of celebrities and so of course and I hadn't So again before this video it's like I don't want to say anything wrong So I had to quickly google our our erin rogers and danica patrick still together and actually there's conflicting stories out there But it seems like no and that no Is not incidental in terms of marriage and ideal and and everything that's in play Because all of this stuff is working on us beneath the surface Yeah, and right so you can see that that the striving for an ideal mode of being the religious striving for an ideal mode of being Is central to what it is that makes hockey? addictive that's right Yeah, necessarily and and so god I saw that in pro wrestling there's a great documentary He said this you can find this documentary on youtube by the way I just started watching it and he's right because that early in the documentary not to give too much away You know hitman heart was part of the wwe and I think it's vince mcmahon You know trump's friend who was running this whole thing wanted him to basically take a fall And hitman heart's like I can't do that that's to betray my character and betray my fans and vince mcmahon is like hey wait a minute We Propped you up because You're good-looking and you're fulfilling these archetypes and you're doing this narrative and we all know You know, what's that word that eric weinstein has you'll put it in the comments We all know this is this is a drama here that we're doing Yeah, but i'm not gonna let you I'm not gonna let you dictate my character. I said wait a minute. I'm the author of the story WWE is what I invented. I run the author. You are the actor Act according to the script. I quit so off he goes into something else. I haven't finished watching In fact, i'm only just started but this is the point that peterson is making here Yeah, uh bret hart called hitman heart is one of the best documentaries i've ever seen and it Portrays pro wrestling as a stark religious Battle between the forces of good and evil and bret hart who at one point was the most famous canadian in the world was overwhelmed by His the archetypal force of his Representation as the good guy. It's is jordan peterson now the most famous canadian in the world Could be a great documentary hitman heart And and it shows you how how you know pro wrestling is is it's not the world's most intellectual activity To say the least and people can easily be dismissive of it but one of the things I loved about the documentary was that it attempted to Understand from within what was compelling about what was being portrayed and it was a religious drama. It just yeah It was shocking and brilliant and so So that is that is actually there is a there's an objective part of that that there's an objective way in which These patterns kind of come together and manifest that the higher and higher versions of this drama Uh, and so the sports drama has a certain level but it's it's limited to a certain extent because it still Happens as a confrontation. Let's say between two irreducible sides and so what happens in something like the story of christ is that That gets taken into one person until all the opposites become the king and the the the the the crimp now where he's going and and So I just made the case and I can make it well because part of how not to straw man is to I can make an excellent case For marriage equality in the church. I don't think it's a hard case to make I think for many people it's a very obvious case to make and they're very angry and offended that that churches and conservative people are Resisting them and so they come up with all kinds of they're resisting them because of ignorance because they've never met a gay person because because the bible is a is an iron age mythology and it should all be laid to rest and we should only read the The poetic parts of it that we agree with and we should just push aside the other parts because everybody really does pick and choose And I don't know. I can make these cases all day long But one of the things that christianity does is deal with and as as peugeot says deals with both Equality and hierarchy and and christ somehow manages to to change these things Criminal become the king and the the the the criminal the You know the highest even in the image of the cross you have this image And as christ is being crucified they're putting a sign above his head saying that he's the king As christ is being beaten they're giving to him a crown and so christ Joins together all the opposites and so in his in his Story you see if you if you're attentive to these patterns you see the highest form Of this pattern being played out and one of the aspects that has to be there for it to be The most revealed or highest form is that it also has to include the world of manifestation I mean, it can't just be a story. It has to be connected to the world So that's why christians insist on The the the fact that jesus is not just a story that he's an incarnated man that he was incarnated but I don't and we do that because Marriage is a beautiful story the fairy tale marriage. We have all of that But we want to participate in it and that means what we do is we want to instantiate it We want to make it real hockey players in their mind have the idea of what it means to I don't know hockey I'll use the nfl season is starting to use aaron rogers a quarterback has it in his mind and they talk about i'm going to Manifest this i'm going to visualize this and aaron rogers and his training is you know They work on the footwork and and to put I mean, it's amazing what they do with a football what aaron rogers does as a football It's absolutely astounding But they do it in their mind and and and in their mind they long to have it manifest in their body and in reality That is a central part of this and to say well, it's a nice story and But always only a story you have that even in the lord of the rings movies where You know, they want um elrond wants arwen to go off You know to go off with the elves and no she wants to stay with aragorn and No, go off where your love will be Undying with you Immortal and but no my love will always be only a dream I want it to take on flesh because that is so powerful and that drives us people have a vision I have a vision for a business and to The business will never be what your vision is But to you you long to have it manifest that's desire and what we do when we worship is we was we attempt to manifest All of this stuff in our lives and so what is true in the temple becomes true in the streets because that's what we desire And that's exactly what they're talking about here I don't believe their insistence I don't believe man that he was incarnated, but I don't believe their insistence I don't believe well, this is this is because I don't it isn't obvious to me and I think Maybe I derived this criticism from nicha but I mean people have asked me whether or not I believe in god and I've answered in various ways No, but i'm afraid he probably exists. That's that's one answer Um, yeah, no, but i'm terrified He might exist that that would be truthful answer to some degree or that I act as if god exists which I think is I do my best to do that, but then there's a real stumbling block there because Even the acting as if he exists is a desire to manifest The reality of the story out into the world. Isn't that what telling the truth is? Isn't that what morality is? There's no limit to what would happen if you acted like god existed Yeah, you know what I mean? Because I believe that that acting that Out fully I mean Maybe it's not reasonable to say to believers. You aren't sufficiently transformed for me to believe that you believe in god Very reasonable to say and as a pastor of a church I can say that about the people in my church and they can say it about me Or that you believe the story that you're telling me you're not you're not a sufficient You're not the way you live is a sufficient testament to the truth And and and this is going to come into play in terms of this ideal because no marriage Equals the ideal but what we desire what we long for is to attain as high as we can as close to the ideal That is what we want That is what our hearts desire and we will sacrifice the pursuit of that is deeply meaningful if it's not in fact meaning itself And people would certainly say that let's say about the catholic church or at least the way that it's been portrayed is that With all the sexual corruption, for example, it's like really really you Why the sexual aspect of because the roman catholic church fails in many many other ways dramatically but there's something about the sexual aspect of it that just It's one of these nexus points in human reality that it's all right down to it You believe that the son of god that that jesus christ was the son of god and yet you act that way And i'm supposed to buy your belief and and it seems to me that the church is actually quite, um guilty on that account because The attempts to clean up the mess have been rather half-hearted in my estimation And so I don't think people people don't manifest Christians don't manifest this and i'm including myself now pay attention to that because a little bit later. We're going to talk about Purity complexes and purity cultures and you know the attempts to clean up the messes have been half-hearted Oh my our attempts to clean up Our attempts to Channel sexuality. Oh If I suppose in that description perhaps, um don't manifest the transformation of attitude that would Enable that enables the outside observer to easily Conclude that they believe yeah Now the way the way to deal with that or the way to to understand that is that It they do but they do in a hierarchy There's a there's a hierarchy of manifestation of the transformation that god offers the world and we kind of live in that hierarchy And those above us hold us together you would say and so in the church there's a testimony of the saints There's there are I was very interested yesterday in in jps bringing in the saints into that conversation It's very interesting stories. There are hundreds and but that but the saints make the point here because You point to a saint and say see It can happen now you you have this all around you point to You look at the list of stanley cup winners and you say see It can happen you look at you look at stockholder portfolios You look at apple corporation and steve jobs and you say see it can happen And what that does is motivates people to say if it can happen to steve jobs If it can happen to I'm gonna use nfl jerry rice or major league baseball babe ruth or hank erin It can it can happen to me And and and that's deep again, that's desire in us and and it's it's it's homo duplex It's it's alone together and and we're swimming in this Now I think i've made my point with this video and this video is already going to be very long So i'll keep going Now we're going to get to some of the point that some of you have wanted all along Traditional marriage is a powerful archetypal ideal And it's not just an ideal because there are many ideals everybody has ideals I say it's an archetypal ideal because again You take you get jordan peterson talking about archetypes and he says well well archetypes are things that you can't get around now the the best argument for full inclusion which is So so when you get down to like say christian reform church politics about what to do with specific Synodical committees and votes at senate and assemblies Well, okay. Well, we're having a deliberative assembly So state your case tell us what you want and what all one body wants to do is number one defeat the human sexuality report and number two Use what I call their burning down the house strategy to sort of Wear the institution down to no longer fight this fight or have a Willing to fight to abandon it to go to separate holes And so I I pay very close attention to their language and the best they can usually do is are things like full inclusion Or marriage equality words like that and so it's okay Well, tell me what that means because full means full because What everybody knows is that sort of the common trick right now is you you take a desire? And you take a desire And you take the desire and you call it an identity And then you leverage all of the civil rights things to demand Equal access for that particular identity black is identity woman is identity gay is identity Lobster eaters can be an identity So full inclusion of lobster eaters and right away. Whoa Hey, full is full and we're gonna walk look at this purity dynamic So the best argument for full inclusion is mercy and vision or equality so And and again christianity does enormously enormous things with equality and hierarchy and and pizho talks about that quite well But christianity isn't just equality. It's also hierarchy and and and And and we really struggle to figure out that language Now this is not taken seriously by the marriage equality vision Because I think in fact traditional marriage is archetypal. I think it's something you can't get around. It's an ideal One man one woman for life. That's the basic formula or mf4l Male male and female female is less than male female why Because there's no potential for reproduction Because there's no potential for reproduction They're they're they're the same and tim keller talks about I like the part tim keller talks about and there's there's difference built in two men are in some aspects more than one man but a man and a woman are because of a myriad of differences between male and female including the reproductive aspect the combination of man one man and one The combination of men and women has a power differential which is way more powerful than two men or two women Okay biology and and reproductive science and adoption and yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but no, it's not the same There's an archetypal ideal with one man one woman that that is the the others are limited compared to it and and one of the things that in our modern period we have Especially with anxieties about overpopulation technology about the pill We insufficiently realize the power of human reproduction And if you want to look at that read ross dalfit's book on decadence take a look at why There's enormous migration from africa To europe why muslim immigration from africa to europe is changing the face of europe? Human reproduction determines the future You know, I was I was walking with Some young progressive women and they were joking about The very few classmates they have that are already married and reproducing children Ha ha ha ha ha ha and they noticed that all of these are republicans and I said Aren't they giving birth to young republicans who's going to win elections 20 years from now? Time We're going to talk about time And this so one man one woman for life is an archetypal ideal. You can't get around it two men No, two women. No three people. No One man one woman for life. Well, what about As long as this works for me No, that's less ideal than for life watch any amount of the bachelor bachelor at bachelor imperil Any of that I want my person for life. That's the ideal they strive for it. They long for it They desire it they sacrifice for it now. They don't attain the ideal. That's what an ideal is An ideal is something that we sacrifice in order to achieve and we want to do so Generally speaking for many great human sacrifices For many visions we wish to achieve we need communal sacrifice and communal participation And in fact, that's why we group up in order to achieve what we as individuals cannot achieve In our culture Marriage has become in our culture an expression of emotional romantic ideal Which is less than this full-bodied incarnate Reproductive Available in both directions because you might say well lots of male male female population decline How does that relate to society? It's complex again read ross douthat's book on decadence decadence There's a lot going on here that we don't understand But but the romantic emotional ideal it's too dicetic Because anybody who's been married will tell you yeah, you have peaks and valleys on that score But why do you stay together? Because there are others are other ideals and lots of other ideals come nested in We stay together for the kids. Why? Because you have an ideal for them And it's it's participating. So in fact This this one ideal is deeply tied to lots of other ideals And if you think through these things They don't work there's a lot of what's going on where we There's it's sort of a it's sort of what affluence can afford If 90 of your population is more or less stable male female Commitment for life Maybe you can have a little fringe of 10 other marriages If most of your marriages are together enough so that the community stays together You can have some wobbly marriages But if none of your marriages are stable, you're not going to have whole bunches of other things Go well in your community and and we sort of have a knowledge of this but but it's sort of the It's sort of a principle of affluence and that If you've got a lot of strength in certain things, you can afford Wobbliness and fringeness in other areas. It's it's sort of a it's sort of a extrapolation on peugeot's idea of center and fringe Now Protestantism altered the medieval and ancient holy common matrix and this is where we get into Charles Taylor's one speed two speed and he talks about And I don't know that you know, a lot of people push back on this and you know, I read Reformation's book and I Don't know if I agree anymore with with Taylor's idea about one speed versus two speed I think actually some of the speeds Went implicit now think about some of these things There's enormous stuff happening around the time of Luther Remember Luther's generation is the first generation to live after the Colombian exchange as Charles Mann calls it in you know 1492 is book 1493 And there's enormous changes in late medieval Europe that are destabilizing the old Stable ways of the church and and there's you know There's a lot of corruption has to be wrung out and that that ringing that starts in the Reformation will continue in the enlightenment That there's the social dynamic between the monastery and the village Towards urbanization and one of the things that that Martin Luther. He's a monk They destroy the monasteries and and the monasteries are abandoned it's interesting if you if you read I think it's in fatal discord Luther and a couple of his pals are the only ones left in the monastery. It's abandoned remember earlier I talked about how religions die. They're abandoned the monasteries are the monasteries are abandoned and There's a special relationship between the king the prophets and the priest again this goes all the way back to the Hebrew prophets and the Hebrew scriptures, but Monarchies pre-modern monarchies are different from modern monarchies because What podcast did I hear was in the rest of history because basically what modernity and urbanization and and an emerging economics Afforded was a far more powerful nation-state and the old forms of monarchy could no longer compete You couldn't just you see this in shows like the last kingdom You can't you just can't mobilize the peasants and give them pitchforks. You need a professional army You need a you need a Navy you need to to figure out medieval kingdoms couldn't muster what they could muster and you can get into Rome and In Rome was a different thing. But again, this stuff is terribly integrated. So So what happens in Protestantism? Now this world is being redone disrupted and and Protestantism is in some ways a fairly early adaptation of this And of course then then takes on flesh and contributes to increasing adaptation because for the most part, you know, you had you had Roman Catholic Spain and the patchwork of Italian city-states but once England and France and germ now you've got Roman Catholic France, but French is France is different. But once those things come online You know The the peculiar blend of of Anglicanism and the British Empire will eventually rule the waves and and France, you know France tries to go toe-to-toe with with England, but She can't really and of course Napoleon. There's an insurgence, but that's modernity Excuse me And and you're setting up the French Revolution By by the ways that That that France resists Reformation and and the Roman Catholic Church does reformation in the Council of Trent and that's how it modernizes And and you can see mappings between you know, the kind of reformation that the Roman Catholic Church did in in Trent, you know getting rid of getting rid of a lot of the medieval isms in order to combat encounter the rise of Protestantism and So you have the rise of the nation-state in Protestant lands and the nation-state in some ways begins to replace Christendom and the king increasingly is the head of the church Henry the eighth and and even in the Holy Roman Empire the the the prince of The of the region decides the religion of the region, of course All this is going to continue to develop and then when we get to the United States will have this idea of religious freedom But there's deep commonalities beneath secularism that that only now we're beginning to notice that no secularism is deeply Christian And and if you lose some of those foundations You lose the glue that's holding the society together that the glue is actually always religious and a whole bunch of these implicit ideal Agreements around certain ideals were what actually held it together And in many ways in Protestantism the rise of the nuclear family relate replaces the monastery and so you actually have all these different speeds and And so that's where you have in Protestant churches. Well, the the clergy's family is supposed to be the model of The members family and and this is where you know, this is where Both the catastrophe of the Roman Catholic pedophile issues and the catastrophes of of clergy Stepping out on their wives is deeply disruptive to their churches Because beneath there are ideals that the the clergy is intended to embody and I've noticed that throughout my ministry and the Protestant Church I will I will give people the official line that I am just like you except I have different gifts They never believe me. No pastor You need to be more holy you need to be the ideal of who and what a Christian is and that's built in far beyond the church and so when when Ravi Zachariah who doesn't even have a church or Bill Hybels when they when there are sexual indiscretions that happen to them it ripples through the church and the pedophile priest thing ripples through Jordan Peterson's imagination. It's like there's stuff happening under the surface here That's foundational more than we know and we can't quite explain it Now part of my challenge and my online conversations with marriage equality advocates and the Christian Reformed Churches say okay, I know the old line male female for life That's a durable line It's sort of like a seawall and now it was aspirational Everybody fails it at one point or another or most fail it or depends on your on your level of analysis And to what degree you're allowing the the ideal to pan out. Tell me the new line and And and so churches will say something like well, we're gonna take the male female out of it two people for life But the problem is that these advocates are banking on looking at what's happening in society and letting those those deeply religious movements underneath compel the other people in the church to maybe flip on this and It's all gone. If you only had lesbian and gays maybe you could make the case and 20 years ago 30 years ago when born that way Was still in its preeminence and you know, just read Andrew Sullivan who I mean he Andrew Solomon understands very well how His attempt. I mean he played an integral part in marriage equality being adopted by the US Supreme Court and so when he watches what's happening with the the BTQ He's terrified because he knows that The foundations are being eroded that two people for life Isn't the standard that's it You you can't you can't build your line on it now. It's not gonna hold everybody knows that you can see that We have a sense of it. So then I say well, where is your line? And I would say your line is actually the society's line right now Which is consenting adults and this is where we get into The fact that in many ways Protestantism Increasingly if we think of it as two-speed the church is one speed and society is the other and we've seen that dynamic Because actually there are way more speeds. We've seen that dynamic and during the Cold War Because basically when there was huge alignment between the morality in the mainline church and the morality In the mainline church and the morality in general America church people were basically an intensification of the moral ideals and maybe You know that they were prigs or they thought to be too intense and impractical but but because that alignment church was an intensification just like the monks were an intensification of the secular clergy or Or the people who are regular churchgoers and then there of course were the other speed of in Christendom people who lived in a Catholic nation and you know they had to a little degree mostly just more folk religion had a little degree some of the Ideas of the bigger the bigger picture, but you had all these strata's and at the top were the monks and on top of those You had the Saints, you know what Peugeot was laying out So you have this hierarchy and and so during the Cold War, you know to be To be a good American Well, you could be a you know to go to synagogue or you go to church and there's all this alignment And and that's over Now many well, they're the church is trying to sort it out. Some churches will say we're in alignment June is liberation month and we have the flags to prove it We're trying to be in alignment, but the country isn't in alignment They don't and the others are saying no, we're not in alignment we're not giving up our ideal Well, which ideal well the Bible. Oh, okay. Well natural law. Okay My argument is no there are ideals and There are structures to these ideals now you might say well that sounds like a natural law argument I'm not making it such You know some of you will go with it how you will Now we're saying consenting adults, but hey that's that's looking really thin read Ross Douthat's piece on can the left regulate sex? That's Consenting adults as a ship has got a lot of leaks in it Part of the reason because consent doesn't manage time like covenant. I Say yes to now, but tomorrow will I regret it? Covenant says I'm going to make a commitment now And as As much as I possibly can I'm going to try to keep it now again We're aspiring to a rise and achieve and to bring to manifest an ideal and They all fall short in the age of decay But covenant deals with time in a way consent never can Then you have all these what was their consent and then the question. Well alcohol age Can they consent? Is their consent conditioned by power dynamics? Consent isn't going to help you that much I know I'm not saying consent is unimportant because it's basically the definition between rape and I'm not advocating that but consent currently is a is a weak is a weak read and You know to borrow from the Hebrew prophets if you lean on that read cane it will break Covenant is much stronger, but that's built into male female for life Sexual gratification is increasingly imagined as a human right At some point depriving children of a right will feel unequal Depriving children of a right will feel unequal And and I don't think it sounds so crazy to to to be afraid of this and This isn't true or stable sexual gratification can never be a right it's actually an achievement and achievements and rights are two wholly different things and This gets again back into the question of Protestantism in the state because well if it's a right well now the state sort of as the new default church in Secular Christendom has to deliver State prostitutes We're not that far from the temple of Aphrodite see these things don't go away And What we've got going on right now are contradictory loosenings and tightenings. Well, we need sexual liberation. Well So let's take a look at governor Cuomo at the end of his grope New York Post So he's Cuomo was working the new Alpha male sexuality don't marry you idiot Because your gratification Well, yeah, there are nice things to develop in a relationship But at some point the relationship gets old or your partner gets old and if you're a high-status male with a good head of hair You can get some There's a rule just don't look for some at work well Is that a rule is it well, we're gonna have to make a law The new Puritans there's a there's an interesting series of conversations going on around Can professors and students sleep together? That's a difficult one because a lot of professors are married to former students And There's a lot of debate you can find some of those links on my blog leading church comm There's a lot of debates about that going on right now power differential and and so again With the old schema The question is really simple Okay, I want to sleep with this person. Is this person my spouse? If the answer is yes Bring some roses home Take take the person out wear something attractive ask Suggest maybe it's Friday night You guys know how if you're married, you know how this goes If the answer is no no and Again the alignment at least in modernity between church and state was about the same Church and stay were on the same page. Now the state has moved on. What's the church gonna do? That's the real question in the CRC is the CRC going to let basically default to The legal standard which again in speeds is sort of watered down weakening Christendom Secularity as Christianity light Now part of why this is as I mentioned before such a fever pitch in the Christian form churches is This a confessional issue and I think rightly Now whether or not you agree with women in office in terms of the reformed confession that we have rightly The decision was made in the 70s that the women in office question wasn't really a confessional issue It doesn't mean that's the only thing to be said about the issue and then now the fierce debate is is When clergy sign and office bears that's elders and deacons to Sign the form of subscription are they signing on to an embrace of traditional marriage? And so what you have in these split-off denominations are that's becoming a confessional issue So when you look at the Alliance of reformed churches that I'll talk about in the minute if you look at the echo The split-off of the PC USA evangelical Presbyterian Church in America There are new confessions being written about this issue and The debate in the Christian form churches is this a confessional issue and you can find videos by people I Know a little bit some are in voices who are saying It's not a confessional issue and They know that for years now. I've been arguing that the Christian form church needs a lot more serious confessional conversation We're having it whether or not we're calling it that we're having it because In the Christian form church, I'm a synodical deputy and I regularly Are at classes meetings my own classes or other classes meetings where Church discipline matters come about and I'll tell you something the Christian from church but the only people that actually get formally disciplined are clergy and employees get fired and The most common reason is sexual misconduct So governor Cuomo figures out hey marriage is for idiots You're better off playing the field. So for a while there was the first girlfriend of the state of New York and then that broke up and so then he's looking for another and Well, if you've been around politics, you know that in in many ways in the United States state and federal politics They don't pay much and so they're kind of a starter position for a lot of young people and Some of my kids have have been in that shoe So if you go into state offices like here in Sacramento, there's a lot of young women and a lot of young men with desire and ambition trying to get ahead and Then you have the Brahmins who have been around a long time older men and older women That have accumulated a lot of power a lot of status Now especially between high-status men and young attractive women We've got a pretty volatile combination there Now At the end of his grope Now we can all agree shouldn't lay to hand on these ladies. Maybe you're gonna have all gonna have to do the Keanu Reeves hand thing You can Google that Rick showed it to me If you're smart you won't marry and you'll be scrupulous about your institutional dynamics Because those are the only ways that power dynamics are enforceable So on one hand if you're in your 60s and you marry someone in their 20s or 30s Some people will test test and other people's applaud And the Christian Forum Church we've sure acted like this is a confessional issue In fact, it's now about the only issue you'll get kicked out of ministry for So confession I if we're not maintaining our confessions Implicit confessions will emerge and govern and that's what's happening and in some ways the human sexuality report is Making the de facto point. Oh, yeah, it's a confession and What's happening now in sort of the burning down the house strategy of well, we're gonna We're going to break the rules and dare people to discipline us and see if there's enough Vitality in the institution to muster itself for a hard. No instead of just a That's the strategy because they can't win with votes Now The crisis of progressive liberation ism is that there is no terminal ideal So Full means full and if you keep following that Well, you know quite frankly High status heterosexual men. We have plenty of sociological evidence That they prefer to not be monogamous Or at least we might derive a sexual identity of non-monogamy That doesn't seem like an unreasonable sexual identity. In fact, that sexual identity seems to be the default sexual identity monogamy is in fact an achievement and One that often requires a community to sustain at a communal level It's an ideal and so I keep asking Progressives on this topic tell me your terminal ideal. I don't use those words I'm gonna use those words now because I hadn't thought of it in these in this way. Tell me your terminal ideal That opens up the door to another thing that we've been noticing about well again what I call progressive liberation ism is that a Purity culture ensues now again when I say purity culture in this area people right away go to this weirdness and Evangelicalism of purity rings and purity culture and the progressives are constantly decrying it Nadia Bolz Weber You know makes a makes a vagina trophy and gives it to Gloria Steinem in celebration of melting down these weird What kind of father? Gives his daughter a purity ring. That's just weird The difficulty they have is that without a terminal ideal and an end point something that is archetypal something you can't get around You just keep going and that just keep going because most of our lives can't sustain True weirdness because our desire for stability and is We just won't live with as much chaos as certain fringe individuals are willing to live with So Your quest for a romantic ideal Will probably lead out of relationships Only to at some point in the future regret it. I have to follow my heart. I have to follow my My secret sacred self I have to follow I'm always on the path for my ideal soulmate Usually what happens is You burn through a few relationships and then you start to regret old relationships and you're still looking but you know Your 50 year old self can't be a good person Old relationships and you're still looking but you know Your 50 year old self can't unless you're of uber high status Isn't gonna if you're a male attract the twenty-something and then you're out of situation where you got all these 50 year old men looking for younger women all these older women Kind of aged out and they're trying to look as young as they can and they're and everybody on both sides are chasing money I see that with the seniors old men or old men without money are looking for old women with money old women, you know The old man with money can get young women. I mean it's this this marketplace We don't want this marketplace. It is less ideal than one man one woman for life intergenerational broad spectrum and Yeah, there's problems with it and yeah, we all fail it and and yeah And for all practical purposes some people can't participate in it and now My preference for the Christian Reformed Church would be at least at this point let local Churches keep this keep the ideal because if you throw away the ideal you're not gonna go anywhere and you're gonna have to deal with individual cases as they come and Figure out what's the best that can be had and done? But you can't monkey with the ideal because if you give up the ideal you not only Invite way more disorder But you also will invoke a purity quest. Well, what does that mean? Well a friend on voices wrote a post and said well, okay, because people were countering some of my arguments So you're just it's it's a slippery slope argument. All right in some ways it is But he said yeah, but you know Once we make Once we do with same-sex marriage what we did with women in office now suddenly we're gonna have to rewrite forms and you're gonna have all these marriage forms that are You know, do you take this woman? Do you take this man? No, it's it's that's gonna get rewritten and and that's not the only thing It's gonna get rewritten because there's actually more going on beneath these other ideals than just this one little substitution and Then just like we saw with women in office now, you've got pastors who are foreign pastors who are against and Increasingly there's gonna be animosity between those two groups within the house. It's exactly what we've seen with women in office and And and then it's gonna be more pure or pure enough along these lines So, okay two men one man one woman. All right, are we going to police? Because we're already not doing it are we going to police the sexuality of singles And then how about the sexuality of single clergy What if I decide I'm done with my wife I'm done with my marriage I'm gonna get rid of her and I'm gonna take a church. I'm just gonna date. Oh Now we're gonna have to have rules about clergy dating in church We're gonna have a rule that a single minister may not date anyone in his church Well, that sounds like a good rule power dynamics at all, okay So let's say a single clergy starts dating someone who isn't in their church you know what everybody in church is gonna say we want to meet your girlfriend and You know what they would actually like they'd like the girlfriend to start coming to church so that she can then be unfolded into the community and Then you know, but then Let's say the girlfriend moves into the pastor's house the parsonage Well, how do you feel about the pastor and his girlfriend living in the parsonage as if they're married and they're not married How do you feel about that? We're gonna have to have rules about that and It just keeps going What if the pastor says I'm Polly Full means full Polly is an identity Polly's a gender identity What if the pastor says well, I'm living I like my girlfriend living with me, but Sometimes we invite others to come over. Okay, we have a rule. You can't invite others that aren't in the church Well, let's say they'd start inviting others on a regular basis and their Polly has three or four people in it Can they all move into the parsonage and then well we well, you know the pastors The pastor's other girlfriend. She's a part of this church So she starts coming to church, but then the pastor breaks up with one of them. I mean, that's a slippery slope argument. Um, Yeah but Just looking around society. Look at Governor Cuomo There's no terminal ideal and What one man one woman for life is is a terminal ideal. It's archetypal. You can't get around it You can't get better than it and So that's why it's properly at the top of the hierarchy now again churches deal with things that are less than ideal all the time and figure out ways to deal with it, but If you give up on the ideal you don't know where you're going and That's where this is going and Now prove me wrong I'm open to hear and I keep challenging people show me your terminal ideal They said well two people for life I Think that I think that ship has sailed What we've actually got are competing slippery slopes because only stable archetypal ideals can arrest a slide and Then what you actually do is reinitiate an uphill aspirational dynamic, which is part of what we don't like Because once we have this ideal we all begin to realize that as Jordan Peterson keeps saying that ideal judges you and so but that that dynamic Mobilizes a community to actually hold each other accountable in order to achieve that ideal Let's look at sobriety The ideal is sobriety People waiver with it and you have this dynamic in a so the ideal is sobriety with respect to alcohol Okay, so someone who's had trouble with alcohol joins a a and now they're alcohol-free But they're sleeping all over the place or they're eating like mad or they're you know, how many other? Addictive behaviors and and what they'll say is no this The sobriety is a bigger ideal than just about alcohol and you need a community in order to achieve it and You know AA has often figured out that a good way to manage the judgment and you know, it's not perfect either but It's in a sense the opposite polarity The opposite polarity is if you have a stable archetypal ideal Slides get arrested because you have an ideal you have a fixed point and if you don't have that fixed point and again I don't see the fixed point in marriage equality if you don't have that fixed point everything slides and if you do have that fixed point you now have the reverse dynamic where You have everybody struggling uphill And that's a better dynamic Is he actually both sides have a slippery slope the affirming have the slippery slope of if we don't adopt this will lose our youth Okay, so you're gonna adopt two people for life But you know with divorce you're already wobbled on the for life, but You know again everybody wants for life because you don't rent a church and gather your friends and bring in a minister To stand up and say I like her now No You invoke an ideal which is why you invoke the symbolism of an ideal Which is why either it's in a church where there's the marriage is well, that's what the church is about it's about an ideal or now people are going to a destination so they go to a Beautiful location now your eye invoking an eye a beauty ideal, but it's all about an ideal and Marriage equality is gonna have to come up with an ideal or these purity dynamics are gonna take over and it's gonna get eaten from within and So the slippery slope argument of the affirming which is we're using our luth Using losing our youth The trads have if we give in we'll lose our moorings We're always dealing on slippery slopes If you go on affirming you will likely initiate the purity dynamic along the lines of the new implicit Liberationist ideals in other words. There's always an ideal out there that we're pursuing In fact multiple ideas nested together deeply intertwined The local option doesn't satisfy in the Christian informed church we know that from women in office because women clergy are annoyed at Those classes and pastors who don't agree that they should be in office and so they're um they're doing violence against me by withholding their approval and and the complementarians in the denomination are annoyed when They're annoyed when the seminary puts out something like this But celebrate women in ministry now this woman right here my Sunday school teacher she the pastor of the church My father was in for 36 years This woman right here. Whoops this one right here another good friend of mine, these are my people, okay, and Again I'm on the pro women in office side, so I celebrate but the political compromise that the denomination took It didn't It didn't finally manage any of this you're gonna have to come up with an ideal or It's just gonna continue and the local option with respect to this. I Think we've seen in enough denominations It doesn't hold Discipline pastor and churches who won't sufficiently affirm or won't affirm whatever the new thing is You're gonna have purity in your new confessionalism Church adapts a new confession its new gender-free liturgies everything I mean Confessionalism is in some way inevitable and it's not a new thing Confessionalism is in some way inevitable and it's and it's partly the way that the community holds itself together Because what confessions do is actually attempt to idea to articulate the ideals that are energizing the community and hold them out there and so when churches either their confessions are too implicit or Their confessions have gotten stale or Their confessions have gotten too rigid They cease to function in the community in a way that holds it together because again The way churches work is that in any community is that you have an ideal that you're striving for that ideal And that ideal may be many things. I mean the NRA their ideal is you know to resist gun gun Gun legislation the ideal of Plan parenthood they have an ideal Anti-abortion groups they have ideals. I mean everybody's got ideals and and the only way an organization I mean everybody's got ideals and and the only way an organization actually manages to do all of this to mobilize people and bring them together is actually manages to do all of this to mobilize people and bring them together is If there's a great amount of desire for those ideas now there can also be a great amount of fear and Again looking at Chris Williamson's You know parasitic organizations and that here's something we want to fight against Something even a good thing. Let's say polio. So you have the March of Dimes to fight against polio and then you beat polio well, then your organization decides it's gonna fight and there's a lot of dynamics in here, but Aspirational ideals stimulate stability in groups. They hold groups together Male female for life is a difficult aspiration That's obvious from church history from human history But it's an archetypal aspiration because I can't think of a better one and again a high in openness If you've got a better one a better archetype to embody and manage human sexuality Both in terms of group stability and Intergenerationally write it down Polygamy, I don't think so less less ideal Governor Cuomo's first girlfriend less ideal every single other Competitor when I look at and I just sort of run the math less ideal That doesn't mean these other things haven't manifest or haven't been tried or people won't try them. They will But now we get back to the Protestant question in terms of church What is church supposed to do? It's supposed to manifest the ideal because you've get the ideal of Christ as now look at what happens in Christianity Christ is both the ideal of the individual and Christ is well Jesus is the ideal of the individual Christ is the ideal of the community because look what the Apostle Paul says you are in Christ Christ in Christianity is a collective and And so that's why you've got the homo duplex and why all of these dynamics in the megachurch and other churches are are working We use groups in order to achieve difficult things together groups make up for individual insufficiencies The Apostle Paul calls that spiritual gifts Sexual desire is always an issue in groups Jordan Peterson's video can men and women work together in the in the workplace That's an old variant of how do men and women do in church? I was watching with Rick Black church on YouTube very popular church on Sunday morning three four thousand people in there for the live stream Men sit on one side women sit on another side People in groups have been trying to manage human sexuality Always aspirationally always imperfectly for all of human history. It's tremendously difficult Sexual desires always an issue in groups Male female for life is the most stable ideal that allows groups to minimize disruption And here's a test case Ever watched bachelor bachelorette bachelors in paradise most of you haven't I've watched some of them now You know the thing that I thought of immediately. Why isn't there an LGBTQ bachelor bachelorette? Just think that through a minute. So you've got one high-status good-looking person And you've got all these people that are attracted to them who are also high-status very good-looking very desirable That's the energy that the show uses they all want to be on Instagram and make a lot of money too, and that's the hypocrisy of the entire endeavor What if you have gay bachelor What's gonna happen? Are you gonna be able to keep the tension between the contestants and the goal? No, all these people are gonna pair off because the way it works is you've got the bachelor living alone And you've got all of the women Seeking the one person and the competition for them That only works if all of the women decide they want a man and you've reduced the pool to one Bachelorette and versed it doesn't work in any other Configuration the the gays and lesbians was all start pairing off down below here and lose interest in the bachelor The show falls apart and I think that's a microcosm of society in general You're not going to you're probably not going to be able to manage human sexuality Apart from this ideal archetype and now again, please don't misunderstand me You've got an ideal and you've got what to do with all of us who fail the ideal and That's what we live with divorce is when you fail the ideal but giving up on the ideal by saying that There's there's no valence difference between who you're attracted to Who you're attracted to Now it might not be that you can change it and For many of us it's not that we can change who's attracted to us if you're single and looking to mate or reproduce Or start a family or have a stable partner for life there are problems all throughout it, but In a very Peugeotian way the ideal is the ideal and We're stuck with it no matter how we think or feel about it and How we deal with the less than ideal is pretty much how we deal with everything in life Now some of you can look at this video and say wow John Paul the second Roman Catholics perspective Reproduction as a part of the package of the ideal It's Paul going Roman Catholic No Because as John Van Damke sort of says I tweak it a little bit most of life's escapist solutions are exchanges exchanging one set of problems for another Part of the power of the Roman Catholic vision That the church can't seem to even fully embrace herself Is there's a certain logic to it that this is the ideal and Protestants Orthodox and Roman Catholics need each other because Now you might look at what I said about Protestantism and say see see In many ways what we went through was inevitable and Again, I think some of the countries in Europe decided to have a reformation France had a revolution Some of these dynamics are inescapable and and they're always inescapable regardless of how well we can articulate the ideal Because again back to Peugeot and Peterson It's not whether we can articulate the idea what we really desire to do is inhabit the ideal What we really desire to do is inhabit the ideal and We need each other for that and so We all do need each other for that Conflict is how we learn and how we pray for unity Now you express your ideal by what you're willing to risk for it reform Church of America They've been dealing with the burning down the house strategy for those who wanted The reform Church of America to go full affirming and the house is burning down and There are now the Alliance of reform churches are peeling off many reform Church of America churches and at the head of that organization are people I know People I've worked with one of them born and raised CRC eventually began working for the RCA when they were collaborating Another one I got meeting with RCA projects that I had collaborated with and worked with a Lot of people in the CRC are watching the RCA house burned down and say What can we do so our house doesn't burn down It's gonna be a mess, but you express your ideal by what you're willing to risk for it And it's that energy that actually creates and in the case of the ARC a new Are they a denomination? Are they an alliance? What is that and and the beat goes on with all of these things? so There's my argument I Think marriage equality leads to the death of Protestant churches because if you lose the ideal You will lose the power that communal striving for the ideal affords the organization Now does that mean that every church that goes affirming will fold immediately no But I think generally speaking you want to talk about power dynamics. I think this is a power dynamic and I think it's part of the reason why At least by some demographers the last Episcopalian has already been born Because in order for an organization any organization not just a church in order for an organization that vitality and life and act in some ways like a living organism again see my conversation with for vacay and JP there needs to be a dynamism that moves it forward and I think what you have with one man one woman for life is an archetypal ideal and if you lose that ideal and Let's say even if your other ideal is implicit. I Think you're gonna trigger these purity dynamics that we're already beginning to see and I think you're not going to be able to harness the kind of Motivational dynamics that in fact the church has used to grow ever since there have been churches, so that's my argument and Once I stop this video, I'll see how long it is It's a long one. So I know most of you sort of crapped out early, but some of you are long listeners So there it is. Can't wait to see what you have to say in the comments
