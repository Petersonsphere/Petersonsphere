 So why don't you tell me a little bit about yourself Nick? What should I call you Nick Nicholas? Okay, Nick Nick is probably easier, okay Yeah, so That's tricky where do I start I live in Santa Cruz oh really yeah, I'm not too far from you I'll be trying to come to the San Jose meet up here in about a week Oh good I have a son who goes to UC Santa Cruz. Oh really? Yeah. Yeah, it's a pretty town Expensive place to live I bet It is A little a little too much I would I would say It wouldn't my wife and I drive in there it's like oh we should we should buy a house and then we pull up Zillow and it's like Maybe a shack I'm gonna grab my water bottle here because I'm I'm fighting your cold and so it helps keep my keep my throat wet nice So when it just went around really bad around here a couple weeks ago, okay It's pretty laid out town to begin with So when did you I assume you found Jordan Peterson before me which seems to be the way of most things so Maybe I found him When did I find him I Feel like it actually it was probably from Joe Rogan that I came across him that first interview He did and then I started digging through his lecture videos Which was I don't know October November sometime around the end of last year Yeah, and when I found him I was just coming out of a cult So I've got quite a unintentional history with Cults it seems which is peculiar because I Generally am a very like I Don't know what the right word is Individualistic person I kind of have a lot of faith in my own ability to understand and interpret things And yet I repeatedly find myself In situations like this In situations like this But yeah the first that was actually the fourth cult technically I had been part of it in a vague sense that was the first one that I actually chose and and Consciously part took in whereas the others were kind of like minor more normal bait-and-switch type of situation Okay You know I I had when I was young I think 18 maybe I think 19 actually I Kind of started looking for alternative lifestyles particularly within the man this headphone has given me some problems Particularly within the the kind of green movement and the homesteading movement So I went about trying to learn how to homestead and Ironically, it seems most people that homestead or at least are willing to teach it are actually Colts good Warning for those out there That's interesting Yeah, and I'm you know, I'm joking there but I Seemed to to particularly have attracted those types of situations So yeah that whole bit of my history started when I when I was going through the woofing program Which is worldwide opportunities on organic farms And so I figured that what it's basically a work-training And so I figured that what it's basically a work trade scenario where farms will put up ad listings and then It's basically you work on the farm for some period of time in a certain number of hours per week and then they give you something in return and it's usually just lodging and Maybe I can do this without this headphone Someone who came he and his wife were on a kind of a clock cross-country trip and then they Came to Living Stones one Sunday and they had they were gonna basically swap a little bit of labor for a free night's stay Yes, and and they They found it a very We of course was only one place that they stopped but they said boy never again That's That's I think the scenario is like, you know There are definitely just farms that you can find through those types of situations that are just looking for cheap labor But it's also like the perfect Situation for people that are doing more than just farms to you know, spread their message Wow And it didn't help you know I was kind of I was coming out of a very strong teenage atheist phase like the very classic You know, I forgot it all figured out and you know It's all material and that whole thing and you know around the age of 18. I started realizing like oh, wait a second there's a lot of experiences and You know, there's a lot of stuff that doesn't fit in this worldview that I can't you know process With using it or if I do process it ends up just being this dull flat Very unsatisfying way to view You know, I haven't experienced it it doesn't exist Yeah, exactly me and my 18 years on this planet Oh, yeah I Had it all figured out and I am you know, I have always had a lot of faith in my own intelligence Not that sounds oxymoronic but it is not Which I've certainly humbled throughout the years now that I think about you know You can only mess up so many times before you start wondering like Charge of myself Maybe I'm not a good master of my master captain of my own ship Well, and it's ironic because yeah, it's it's a very Stark contrast between my kind of Again I kind of default towards that dull I'm the master of my own you know and then it gets to the points where it's just too much there's too much built up that I haven't been able to process and then it kind of bursts out in a big Motion hence for instance at 19 taking off to Hawaii to go work on a random farm and learn you know Whatever I thought I was gonna learn there so of course I picked an ad that was like meditation and retreat center with organic farming and and It sounded great and and all that All that stuff and when we got there it ended up being a group of Hare Krishnas That actually had a massive Network so I mean like Certainly, I mean I was a very I mean like I mean like certainly a Few hundred people were involved and they had kind of taken over the whole part of the island this is the the big island out in Pahoa, which is like the It's like the Wild West out that like I've been I backpacked through Europe when I was 18 By myself and went and did all that stuff Nowhere I went in Europe felt as foreign as This area of Hawaii, it's a really bizarre place and it's where the lava flow is so basically the problem is that no insurance companies or or utility companies will put anything out there because They're worried that the lava is gonna change direction and just wipe it out And they don't want to so the only people that live out there are people that are willing to do so with like minimal utilities and right water catchment is the main way anyone has any water to work with and And it usually attracts people running from the law because there's just none out there, you know, and then It's a weird place. It's a really weird place So that was the base for the Hare Krishnas which in itself is like and I can kind of get into this I kind of have a philosophy at this point that everything is actually cults that the fundamental mode of Human society is is cultic Right and that kind of gets into that. Yes the question. What what does a cult do for a person? Well, there's the the surface level kind of like it offers community and and you know group adhesion and those types of things, right I Almost think of the word cults as like the particle that makes up culture Right. It's the smaller version that then That's good. I like that And so when you ask the question, what's it doing for people? I'd say its main function is to make the world digestible able to be consumed right because without any cultic framework, we're just kind of lost in an amorphous experience of life that has no context or or inherent meaning and that's tricky, right it The example to actually play with those dynamics all the way just because we're such a social creature You'd have to imagine a person that had no socialization whatsoever and what they're interpreting as as The work which has actually happened. There's been feral humans and There you know, they don't develop in the way they They're not almost not human in the way that we think of humans it Diverts back towards something more like a very smart monkey That no offense to the feral There's the feral human cohort of my following that I write him a letter said maybe they should skip That the feral the feral humans on YouTube But I think that's an awesome observation that I think that's really helpful You know a lot of the the Jordan Peterson Sam Harris conversation got into this a priori framework Which yes any part of it is hardware that but a lot of its software and we're very you know we're very mysterious creatures and For being us we think we'd know ourselves better and we clearly don't No, not at all. Not at all and that's kind of you know In the process what's it mean to make the world digestible? Well, it is it's not necessarily just in the mimetic route right, that's and I think Jordan Peterson has got into this before too where we've got the memes and Then we've got the genes and the relationship between the two of them is not nearly as cut and dry as we would like to perhaps imagine right I Think that's very I think that's very true Yes, and a lot of it is like we can't actually get down to our own hardware And it's almost like we're stuck in a mimetic complex where even the hardware itself is what is producing the You know the mimetic framework and so there's not There's not a good way that we can actually untie ourselves from any mimetic Fright, you know that even that statement means nothing to a Human from where we normally operate from you're you're always operating within it The most basic one of the most basic levels is just language Which is you know pretty extreme Mean I Can't think of the word possession right we we become possessed by language to the point that we we can't operate not using language and then there's there's Religious movements that basically try and allow you to get underneath you know The the language that our mind is constantly using to interpret everything and then of course the structure of the language and how we go about goes on forever I forgot what my original point with oh, so what is the oh another interesting observation is just you know when you start kind of particularly when You get into our postmodern context. You know this kind of post-truth world and You know, what does it mean for still listening hang out? I gotta get it Cool What does it mean for a a Oh Darn I keep losing my train of thought I've got all this nervous energy. I'm not used to talking Makes the world digestible. Oh darn I forgot where I was going with it Well, I'll go back to the story and then maybe the idea will will come back around So, yeah show up at the On the big island of Hawaii with a bag and two guitars I don't know why I brought two guitars when I didn't have a car or anything So I'm walking like miles a day to get around the area The area But two three it was a very silly With two guitars situation. Yeah, very minimal Yeah, yeah classical and a steel string very Do bizarre things when you're 19 and trying to figure out life So we get there and of course we find out that it's not just a Meditation, you know a kind of non religious meditation Denominational yes And we try, you know Thankfully two people I went with a friend of mine and Two people showed up the day before we got there that had done the same thing where they just randomly decided to go Do this wolfing program at this place? And so the four of us kind of grouped up and one of the guys From the other group was borrowing his friend's car So we had some amount of transportation once we had kind of all linked up and everything which made the whole situation a lot better but you can very easily see how people that You know had to kind of put everything on the line to get out there in the first place Then would become stuck within the system because it's their only means to you know Have anything it's it to eat or have a place to sleep And there were certainly people like that there So we ended up only sticking around So we ended up only sticking around for about two or three weeks We kept getting into arguments with the people and I kind of took you know, I like to go in and deconstruct Systems it's fun. It's like a game to me and so I was kind of like poking around and trying to find the inconsistencies and and all that kind of stuff and it drove them nuts and I love this story. This is an awesome story Just see it Very very strange set of experiences I've had not all I mean I was a missionary in the Dominican Republic and we'd have people come down and because they were looking for whatever and They would roll I lived in a little town towards the end of the world in a sense and the most interesting people would come and live there and because if there are hardly any North-americans living there, so you'd all get to know you don't find each other pretty quickly and yeah. Oh It was it was just Yeah, you do you get the really weird cultures in those? Places no one else wants to not wants to necessarily but just no one else goes. Yeah you know this spot in Hawaii was probably more along the lines of wants to because of the constant threat of being wiped out by a volcano Very it's like all of the energy You know ambient energy was just pushed through the roof there You know you had like the volcano going off right there The the freaking rainforest the jungle was just shooting up out of the ground You had the Pacific Ocean like you know there within view at all time every all of the Elements were just so big and you could see it like driving people Crazy you know it was too much Weird place You know so eventually we basically got kicked out of that place and What we did is we rented a shack in the jungle We were we were staying at a noni farm in an abandoned school bus for for a couple weeks that's you know we were trying to get away from the home base of You know it's Chris McCandless in paradise Yes, yeah, yeah the into the wild guy you know who died up there in Alaska. Yes But at least it's warm warm. It's a lot harder to die. There's a lot more food to Everything Stayed at the noni farm for a while basically trying to separate ourselves from the group to see if we could like still make it work just doing the farming work with less of the religious influence And it's not you know It's not to say like a group of people practicing a religion was the problem It was a lot more of how they specifically had had it structured which was extremely Dictatorial and like You know a hierarchy that was really rigid in its command line Yeah So we get out we end up renting a shack in the jungle with nothing no Electricity no running water there was a water catchment system that we had been using for Weeks before we found out it was infested with Mosquito larva so we had just been like brushing our teeth and cooking with it. You know we never drank it straight because It's not safe. You have to heat the water up We had to sleep in a tent inside the shack because it was infested with cockroaches So camping inside the building It was very silly It was very silly during that time I ended up Starting to date the girl that had come with the other Dude, they weren't together, but so it was three guys one girl. I got the girl Oh their two dudes took off with the car So and they were they said they were going hiking for the weekend and like a week later We're like hmm. We still haven't heard anything two weeks later. They finally sent us a message saying Where we're not coming back? And we still have the car And so at this point, you know, we were about four or five miles away from the town When we were with the Krishna's but this shack in the jungle this and it was owned by one of the main Krishna guys He owned thousands of acres. He just bought up all of the land No one wanted and then put up all these shitty. Sorry Not good structures So Oh, so so you Basically you took the highway out from the town about nine miles and then you hit a Sign that just says end of the road and it's where the volcano back in the 80s The lava flow just wiped out an entire city and the highway that took you out there So then you'd walk across, you know, I don't know a few hundred yards of Lava and then the highway would reappear and then when you saw a bread tree Which is a distinct fruits like a giant spiky fruit You turned right into the jungle and walked back for about a mile and hoped you found the shack and that's where we lived so it was about ten miles from town and we didn't have a car and because You're so far out at that end of the road place no one ever drives out there So you'd have to walk usually about five or six miles until you were close enough that there was neighborhoods and traffic So that you could hitch a ride the rest of the way We stayed there for the remainder of the month and it was just too difficult we paid $200 to rent it for the month So we you know had And the dude got money out of you Definitely and then We moved to a place called cinder land So one of the recruitment strategies the Krishna's had was a food party Dance because they would do the curtain where they are singing and dancing in front of the Statues and it's a whole production and then they'd have a giant meal and they would feed whoever would come to the to the thing And that was every Saturday so this other place was basically just a hippie commune called cinder land they called themselves a Eco village and We slept under a tarp so we didn't have walls anymore, but there also wasn't cockroaches Anything so it was actually like an upgrade. There's a really big like giant mesh Tarps not like the tarp you'd get it You know Home Depot or whatever? And then you just had a mosquito net over your bed and that was pretty much that you know, just gravel on the ground and We stayed there for for I think a month and a half Is there a totally I was on the island for a total of four months. So kind of forget how the time broke down, but And that was actually a lot more fun there was nothing productive going on at all Oh on Saturdays to compete with the Krishna's they'd have a pot pizza Party so they would do all this cannabis cooking and then invite all the hippies to come have a drum circle in the under a tarp Very very strange place. Oh Oh Wow, we stayed there for a month Lots of really weird stories from that place It's like all of the normal dramas you normally encounter in life, but they're all like times a hundred out there Yeah, yeah This yeah, I got my first acupuncture There because I helped a dude pay for his groceries His name was Thunder and my first acupuncture was given to me by Thunder laying on on the ground On a on a pallet And that was really intense He put the needles all the way through my feet in between my the bones of my feet Because he said it was like a grounding thing to pull the energy out So that gave me a really negative view of acupuncture Like laying there with my eyes closed just trying not to have like a full panic Like I couldn't move or stand or anything because I had the needles in my Waiting it out Don't get acupuncture in the middle of nowhere by a guy named Thunder another good piece of advice Um, if that's not obvious Stayed there for a month and a half nine years later. So like a year and a half ago or something. I'm 29 There's a guy that was doing a series of like kind of Hour-long documentaries on various cults that he would find and go explore and see what their system was Well cinderland was one of the ones he went to go explore So when I was there, I just thought it was an eco village with you know, it's Just a silly hippie place to hang out and you know Ends up that's not the case and that the main guy who was gone when I was there called himself Jesus With a Z G E Z U us the U us No relation to Kanye. Yeah Wondering where Kanye got his inspiration Jesus the cinderland and he so it ends up the giant tarps we were all sleeping under Were actually supposed to be sales for an ark and What had happened is that Jesus had a you know Revelation revelation, thank you That global warming was going to cause the sea levels to rise so dramatically That he was going to build an art right typical Noah's flood reworking he was gonna build an ark which Ten years later nine years later. They were actually doing like building this wooden contraption out of like palm trees and You know, it was about 20 feet long not quite big enough to restart the world but The tarps we were sleeping under were actually intended to be sales for this ark and he was going to when the Flood happened sail his ark from the Big Island of Hawaii to Machu Picchu in South America which would then be at sea level and then he would restart humanity with his his His little cult there. He had a plan see that was cult number two. Yes. He definitely had a plan good, so Good for good for Jesus with a Z. Yes Jesus with the Z Yeah, so that was number two granted when I was there He wasn't and it was just a pretty basic little goofy hippie commune You miss Jesus and just got the disciples too bad, right? And then number three came about two years later So the same friend I went to Hawaii with And then you know, he had split ways and gone with the other guy that had the car and We hadn't talked for like a year and then we kind of warmed back up to each other and we're hanging out a couple years later He had a wife now and a daughter once he'd come back and He remembered a teacher that had given a a kind of new-agey lecture About love and he was a teacher Kind of new-agey lecture about love and he had this whole system of how it all Works and how the religious symbolism works and he found it really interesting So he contacted this guy and found out that he had a permaculture setup. So we're still trying to learn like You know basic Homesteading skills through this whole experience And So he sets up to go basically learn permaculture from this guy And So he goes out there with his wife and his like two-year-old daughter This is Idaho. We were living in the Pacific Northwest. So it wasn't too big of a jump who's up on the panhandle Can't remember the name of the town I If you can't tell I seem to have a thing for shack like spaces I Can touch the ceiling I Don't see a tent though, it can't be too bad upgrades, right? The tents out back So We go we go to this he shows up a week before I do I'm having phone conversations with him and it's Like I can tell something's weird But he won't say what he just is like really wanting me to come like right now Which I don't understand why here like what is? So I get there the old guy and his wife it ends up, you know We were there for about a week before we got the whole story or I was Ends up he was a failed cult leader So at one point his whole permaculture setup had about 20 people working it And His whole thing was that he believed that planet Nibiru was going to fly past the earth any year now so classic doomsday another interesting quality of Colts actually an interesting quality of culture in general is Doomsday like the only reason anyone does anything is because of doomsday the entire green movement is not like Let's reconnect with the earth. It's we have to or it's going to die Which kind of threw me for a long time like why is that such a prevalent notion in seemingly every Culture that we encounter and then I started thinking well, it's probably us projecting death which is to say no matter what like right life ends in a An apocalypse right now. It might be a personal one But it's no less we still have to grapple with that that same Structure and so we have this way of mythologizing it and then using that to be able to process the experience of death and Thus you end up with all cultures in some way having some basis of an apocalyptic, you know That's my guess at least I think it's a good guess. I think it's true When I teach about the day of the Lord of the Old Testament I mean the day of the Lord is a very interesting device because it's the fall It's the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem. It's a plague of locusts. It's it's the crucifixion. It's the resurrection It's the it's judgment day. It's all those things are all the day of the Lord and And it comes to each one of us personally it comes to every institution. It comes to every household It comes to the whole world. I think I think you're right on Yeah, and that's yeah The the interesting thing is seeing what people do with it and how they structure it Yeah, and that's a good example is you have so many elements to it within the Christian mythos Where you can't almost you can't quite parse it into some simple a simpler form it's always it's got it's Sitting on a paradox in a sense, right which is that's another part of my cult theories is that one of the main features of a powerful Cult is that it has the ability to process a paradox now it process is tricky because it's more like it allows us to Experience a paradox rather than like make sense of it with our our mind You know Christ's crucifixion and resurrection or even the figure of Christ at all as God incarnate those are central paradoxes that fundamentally don't actually They don't make sense to our conscious mind, but they hit some perceptual system underneath it Right. They change the way that we are actually experiencing life or they should that's Ideally its function And you know cults that can't deal with paradoxes usually are very short Short-term and part of that too is that when you can process a single paradox it kind of gives you a a Like a lens that you can use then to interpret all Incoming information and that's really necessary because if you don't have something like that Your cognitive dissonance starts to build right as new experiences coming in it it can't Transfer over into a processed bit of your network fast enough and we start feeling Dissonance when that dissonance peaks a threshold the person will jump Colts. They'll go find another interpretation that Reduces the cognitive dissonance back below their threshold So if you're looking at really powerful interpretive systems They generally need some way to be able I would actually say it's their fuck they're they're Probably their most useful or I can't think of a word Their base function is being able to actively interpret life as it is happening You know And I would argue that's like a very very very very very very very very very very very very very religion is also Trying to get us to do right we go back to these old stories and make sense of them and Figure out all these these hidden intricacies Hiding in the stories and all of this is kind of building up a skill set so that we can symbolically Interpret life as it's happening Right, so I think we end up in in issues when we either stick too strongly to the past which is like we We don't see it as a skill we see it as a isolated truth locked at some point in history Rather than as a truth that can be experienced You know actively within our our own Experience I think it's really good. It's really helpful Maybe No, I think there's a lot there. That's really true Because we do need we do need Because I mean you're exactly right. I mean the world is is just too it's it's manifestly Complex that we can't process it and so and part of that is paradox and in fact That's what you know You might think of religions kind of like enzymes and they help break these down now. They don't explain them away But they do allow you to hold them at least To actually add it to yourself and then change your expression through the you know, it's yes Like the analogy to consumption is like a really good one Yeah, you can't do anything with an apple right until you you break it into pieces and then that that Process of breaking it down and synthesizing it with your body is what produces the energy needed to actually Do all this stuff right part part of the reason we can't process most leaves is that we have a friend who's a biochemical engineer in Iowa and says we lack this enzyme and so, you know one of the things he was working on is creating biofuel and so he uses these enzymes and breaks things down and Interesting and I think I think you're right cult religion they break they break this stuff down and Into a productive package that we can actually Use that's right. No, I think that's I think it's a terrifically helpful observation I really appreciate that and and the other part of that too this is the old thought that I forgot a while back is We kind of are at the point right this this postmodern frame that we Imagine as being well like current. Yep. I don't think it's actually current I think it's what happens any time two cultures try and synthesize Now we can synthesize cultures. It's just that normally the consumption rate is really slow so for example, you know The spread of Rome right a large part of its collapse was This inability to hold all of these cultures within a single framework Where it tried to synthesize to right? It's trying to eat an elephant in one bite, right? You can't do you have to cut it up into the pieces and then you know You might be able to eat an elephant, but you certainly won't be able to do it all at once, right? The trick with the modern it will The current age is just that that effect is Overpowering we can't escape it because we're for every event you see a thousand opinions around it right that are all a specific cultural lens and We don't know how to synthesize all of those viewpoints at once All of those viewpoints at once so what we end up having to do is isolate our Ability to do so into a pretty tight cultic bubble and then that's the other interesting bit is that We know this is the that we're living in a cultic world Because whoever we look at that's not in our cult. We think they're in a cult It seems silly to not take that one step further and go Yeah But we defend ourselves from it from this idea of some objective truth And that's what the concept of objective truth has traditionally done, right? You know, then objective is a bit you you have what I call the monarchical vision You have the monarchical you see the world clearly And and so in a lot of in a lot of ways people who say deconverted from Christianity They would use metaphors like I was stepping out of the room into the bright light of day I mean, that's that's kind of a way to represent You know now I see Clearly. Yeah now I see the cult I was in where right before I just thought it was The world right Recognizing that you're still in a world Yes, and yeah, you don't you have no culture It's like a Russian doll problem, right? Right, right break one open. You're just in another And I think that's actually like a main part of this whole thing is like instead of trying to always escape our cults That granted it does have some use right sciences kind of The cult breaker and then right right ends up recreating the same thing in the process of trying to escape it, right? No, that's that's really good and you know because one of the things you know I hope to talk to James Lindsay who's part of the Bogosian Lindsley Pluckrose Trio who wrote the hoax papers and and Peter Bogosian was a big he wrote a manual for creating atheists And so they've been he's been big into this, you know Science and what do they discover? But oh my goodness. There's a religion out there. Yeah, it's Getting surprised. I'm shocked. There's a religion Oh my goodness, there's a religion out there is yeah, it's getting surprised Shocked. There's a religion Shocked have you oh, here's my winnings. Um, you know Yeah, but all life is religion and it's it's I I think you're really helpful this is really good and uh So I guess the final part of this is like instead of trying to escape The cults or make one seem like the real one and the rest are just deluded people It makes more sense to embrace that aspect and then from there going go forward through a pragmatic game right, so They're not all created equal some cults have the ability to process Much better and much more meaningfully than others. Yeah. Yeah, and so I and I this it gets big but I think this is Inevitably where humanity must go because of our modes of production right, so You have the you have the tangible age, which is most human history You know up until the the peak of the tangible age happens at the industrial revolution And then we enter into the intangible age the age of thought and ideas and and right now america's economy Is mostly based off of the production of intangible goods Interestingly, you also see a major shift in how we symbolize value in the world with that as well Right whole all the human history up until the intangible age Money is represented by a physical Good a precious metal usually but also beads or shells or right some limited resource that you can Hand to somebody else With the intangible age that system could not function because thoughts move way faster than physical objects right, so We that's when you see the rise of fiat Uh currencies suddenly pop up And what is a fiat currency? Well, it's functioning In this intangible realm. It's not tied to anything in the actual world It's largely functioning on on belief fiat itself means I think in arbitrary order Yeah, you're just Right um I think that we will see a third age coming Which would be You know the untangible age and that this Untangible is not dealing in the realm of ideas but in the Underlying structure that produce that ideas come out of which is that cultic structure Right, and I think that the intangible age will peek at the development of ai which will leave humans very Very little room to go anywhere else to have something to trade it I think that can be symbolized in a in a number of ways one might call it like trading in our our Experience of being alive rather than necessarily our interpretation of it. Although it all is tied together, you know, you can't divorce the the realms And I think we're already seeing this I think that's what social media is And right the even the concept of celebrity is changing From someone who's good at something to someone who just enjoys being alive Right, we follow them just because we want to see their experience of life itself Not because they're the smartest or they're the the fast or whatever we participate in their experience of being alive Yes. Yes, exactly Right now there's no value structure for that. And so what we're doing is we're backwards Translating it into the tangible. So we the only way it becomes valued is by selling ad space I think once we make the jump to actually valuing it itself. We'll see this automatic pragmatic game of cults arise and it will be actually Exposed to Geez It's my roommates coughing. I don't know if you can pick that up. I don't hear okay Exposed to to economic pressures Right open market pressures, and I think that that's actually a really good thing particularly when we don't have our hierarchy inverted where the Untangible or right other the soul right that part of life that doesn't You can't quite capture other than by being alive Yeah, I think that we will that Direct market pressures will will create a system that is Direct market pressures will will create a system that is Really very good for people. Oh and when it's not in service to the tangible, I think that's what's making it so Gross at the moment This kind of hidden manipulation in how the whole system is functioning that we're not aware of But we'll see You know it could also go the other way and be terrible or it could turn into some type of like You know the government is the the truth Right all the classic cultic. Yeah things that pop up when The ground gets a little yeah Yeah, and this is this connects again to peterson because that's a large part of his argument is like Christianity isn't where it's at because of Manipulations of power systems.
