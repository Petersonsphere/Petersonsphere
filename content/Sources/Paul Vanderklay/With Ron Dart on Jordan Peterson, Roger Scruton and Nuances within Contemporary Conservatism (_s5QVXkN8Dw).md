 those life in the south life in the south is warmer than in the north i assume we're getting some balmy days up here too oh yeah yeah sorry i can't bring the squirrel in today yeah busy chasing little nuts and all over the place you seem to this time you seem to be in your book room yes yeah in my study room where i yeah you've got the you've got the disease the the the book the book accumulation disease yes it is an illness that there's no cure for i know i know i uh so when my father passed you know i had to clean cleaned out some of his books but my mother has the same disease and it's like boy when they pass what am i going to do with all those books they weigh so much yeah yeah it's knowing how to when to purge how to purge what to keep what not to keep and we find a thousand reasons for keeping when we should be purging yeah that's right i remember when my when my grandparents moved into uh into the retirement community my grandmother only allowed my grandfather one tiny little bookshelf and he all he had left finally was was bovink and bovink and kiper in dutch that was it good reformed heritage that's right that's right all we had left and um and uh grandma grandma had no patience for anything i'll get rid of these books oh i see yeah well what's what's life like for you as a as a professor are you doing zoom classes or what's going on at your at your work well what i've been doing that i mean they have the readings for the courses to do and then what i'm doing i'm taping lectures and then they have to watch the lectures about 10 15 minutes little micro lectures in that sense and then i'm asking them to write small papers in response so that i know they understand some of the major ideas yeah but it's been a little tricky uh making this transition but i'm teaching other courses in may and june as well on islamic tradition upper level upper level christian tradition then back to ideology and politics again okay okay and the assumption is that may and june will all be online as well yeah i think that's the idea i mean the hope is that maybe late may early june we maybe can go back but nobody's counting on that i know some decisions are being made in europe and elsewhere even in canada over the next couple of weeks if things flatten out nicely we may tentatively take a few steps forward but nothing too audacious in that sense yeah what's it what what about for you in the states well i you know churches there's county lockdowns and in sacramento at least there's there's been a lot of there are a couple of churches that they closed down their regular services but they kept having small group meetings and those those churches sort of became clusters for infection so there's been quite a bit of attention to to those churches i suspect that churches will be some of the churches and sporting events will be some of the last things to be able to open and so and i have a high like many churches i have a good number of seniors that are the core people of the church so so really my my focus is on them because you know often the widows you know often more widows than widowers naturally i mean many of these people are isolated in their homes and for for health reasons and so my concern is is really for them so we'll see you know we'll see what happens i i don't you know we've got a small church so if they restrict things to say 50 with social distancing you know that would probably serve us but my experience with people face to face is that all of these ideas of social distancing are quite dependent upon any given individual's idea of their risk so so we'll see we'll see what's it what's it like teaching without students well i mean to me education if nothing else it's eye to eye soul to soul yeah working with people and then when it gets transferred to a machine something substantive and significant gets lost i understand the imperative nature of it but something is lost and as long as it's temporary it's it's doable but certainly not i don't think the best way of providing meaningful education and i think most of it just for those of us who see education as wisdom and insight and character formation not just transferring information and facts and statistics you know being with people you know sitting with them hearing their stories as well as engaging with the information in a course it's a second best in that sense and so but i think we all see it as a passing season like a cloud in the sky yeah but when dark clouds come in you have to do different things and if storms appear you have to clothe yourself differently but you know it will pass too but so it's living in that tension i think for all of us yeah yeah no it's same i feel the same way i was i've been you know all my all my life i've had the the rhythms of worship and community and to have those disrupted i found um i found really disturbing and i you know it's it's interesting because yeah you don't you don't realize until something until there's the void and then it's like wow has that been how has that been such a deep part of me yeah and it does it does take a soul adjustment uh to rethink how that's going because the work of a pastor like that of a teacher at the best is pastoring as well as passing on the important ideas of a faith community or the role of education and so when a certain approach uh is denied because of a crisis then it's a it's a bit of a mental soul readjustment for a short season which takes us a little inward and then how do we do this outward differently for yeah yeah well your your um your book arrived in the uh in the flesh oh good which is lovely and i think i really do you know it's one thing to to look at a kindle or a pdf version it's a whole other thing to you know have the thing and i i think it's a i really like the look of the book i think it's i think it's i think it's attractive and um and that's you know jordan jordan is the the topic of conversation jordan and scrutin yes and um well what the cover the cover also with the face half seen half not seen is an attempt to say we see we see not yes the circle of thinking we see too much but we are also where uh we can see through his eyes but seeing through his eyes is not necessarily totally understanding what we see yep yep yep so so so the book is out and um and jordan has tweeted recently that he's working on the second book and and you you sent me a note and said let's talk about scrutin and i until jordan peterson came on i knew nothing of roger scrutin so who is roger scrutin well roger scrutin in the last probably he died as you probably know a couple of months ago um but within the last 40 years he's established himself as probably the most preeminent um conservative both within england in a broad sense of conservative just not political thinking but arts culture music um obviously politics economics and so uh he's he's probably one of those crammed immense political theorists of a renaissance humanist variety and he's had quite an impact on the more sophisticated american conservatives um and so he brings together that anglo-american conservatism uh embodied at its cultural political aesthetic economic religious best and so um i think it was probably apt and pertinent that given peterson's perception as a conservative uh that he would engage someone of a far more sophisticated version of conservatism um scrutin comes out of a very older um a british form of conservatism which is really an early form of liberalism actually and peterson would lean in that direction also one comes out of a more psychological philosophical the other um much more deeply rooted religious political aesthetic artistic tradition the role of music in the arts and so i don't think there's many of his quality in terms of sheer literary output of articulating what um the best of a certain anglo-american conservatism is and i think this is why then jordan peterson was both asked to have a dialogue with them um and then um and i think i sent you the article too that uh it's the first article that's actually comparing peterson to scrutin i don't know that you sent me that article it was in touchstone maybe i just sent you maybe just to take a but i think it was in december touchstone by brison and he looks at the peterson uh scrutin in which no one really has touched on scrutin and peterson yet and he suggests that actually they're both contributing a great deal and perhaps a comparison needs to be done on them um could you give a little summary of of of the article and what you found important about it i'm going to look it up so that i can link to it yeah so it's yeah i believe it came out in december 219 is it coming up on your um computer there in touchstone yeah so what he what he's done is essentially says you know many people obviously within the english context if they lean in a conservative direction would know roger scrutin he's taught in the major universities he's engaged in challenging certain forms of secularism he articulates in a thoughtful manner a more high cultural form of conservatism and as i said given as i said given peterson's frequent critique of the left people then see him on the right but not a silly understanding of the right interesting enough a new book has just come out it's called myth and mayhem the leftist critique of peterson huh i was asked to review it and um i think it's probably a significant because some people when they're interested in scrutin or peterson they ignore the economic questions they ignore the question of state and society they're more interested in the cultural psychological dimensions the literary dimensions philosophical at times theological but sometimes the economic issues are not looked at as carefully as they could be and so i think this was exposed in peterson's engagement with zizak in which he came across both theoretically and practically really not having an in-depth understanding of marxist thought socialist i think interesting enough zizak has done the introduction to this book as well the myth and mayhem a leftist critique of jordan peterson found it so i have yet yeah yeah so they're sending me a copy to do a review of and i think that's significant because this is one of the legitimate social liberal critiques of peterson is that when he does engage the economic question he tends to lean a little more in a market economy direction with in a canadian context obviously and i think with the coven crisis we're realizing you can't badmouth the state uh either in its role in dealing with the issue or assisting people who are put out of work so it's interesting the coven crisis is has come as it had been an affront to the right which has tended to society as the good the state the problem well when you hit a crisis like this and of this proportion if you don't have a state on board working in the states with states uh you're initially dealing with the terrible pandemic in people's lives but also all those out of work how are they going to fare well the state has to be involved and rightly so in supporting people financially and economically so this if the good of the of the pandemic if there's a good in the pandemic you can see yes the state necessarily has to play a role at the level of health care coordinated health care and then assisting many of those women and men who are now out of work because of the crisis and this would be elements of um myth and mayhem a leftist critique of peterson and this would be zzak's critique as well is that the state does have imperfectly a role to play in the common good as well as society it's not either or as some ideologues think it should be so so here's the here's the article i'll just i'll just share the screen um here's the article god fears an open letter an open letter to christian readers of jordan peterson and roger scrutin um i i haven't had a chance to read this and i didn't see it taking religion seriously um well what was the what was the gist of the article if you could sum it up if you recall well i think as easy even as you're looking at some of the subtitles it becomes um clear first of all um well the article is called against secularism whether it's whether it's hard or aggressive or soft and passive secularism the article argues that in fact peterson and scrutin take the position that a sacred view of the the world of life makes for a deeper life purely secularism shrinks shrinks reality and in the article he says that the sacred becomes the sacred for many so the finite becomes the new god what tsl would call strange gods uh so he looks at he looks at peterson and scrutin's role of being much more integrated and bringing together um the sacred and the secular secondly he looks at how both have been caricatured from people who who don't understand what both scrutin is up to the good life that includes the secular and the sacred and so is peterson uh in that sense as well so they're trying to reclaim or re-enchant re-enchant the world again in that sense versus in a way it's been disenchanted and um so calling for a much more honest read of scrutin and peterson rather than caricatures or simplistic dismissals either from the right or the left so it's a plea it's a plea to actually people do their homework before they criticize rather than creating caricatures and critiquing the straw person in that process and it's the first article that is really i mean i've done articles well i've done the book as you know on peterson i've also always invited to a symposium did a symposium two years ago on roger scrutin uh and i haven't done something on the two of them so this book by james bryson does does that and does it i think in a nice key in the ignition way uh in that sense and it invites people who don't know scrutin to say well here's a portal they can get in um if you're reading peterson well peterson and scrutin there's something that perhaps they're walking on the same pathway in some ways i think scrutin is more developed in his understanding of this he's spent you know given where he's coming from culturally the history of england what it's got the resources he draws from and his own commitment vocationally to think through this he's he's far more prolific in understanding um much more as i mentioned renaissance humanism in terms of conservatism peterson would certainly point that direction and um but scrutin's developed the thinking much more he's more sophisticated in understanding that and it's too bad he was diagnosed with cancer and died fairly quick uh as a result of that but his line and lineage will certainly continue yeah now you mentioned um and i'll have to i'll have to plead completely ignorance of english and canadian politics you mentioned the tories now as a as an american when i hear tories i think the american revolutionary war because that's the only context in which they come up in our insulated state here but um you mentioned a connection between the two so so what was what was what's that about well that symposium i was on actually a book came out of it on roger scrutin i looked at the the differences between anglo-american conservatism and anglo-canadian toriism and they're very different and some people confuse toriism with conservatism and uh scrutin like peterson in a little different way um within that tradition of anglo-american conservatism you you have the role a certain suspicion of the state i mean you look at say john lock second treaties of government um wealth and nations david hugh we can go on on with that um but the the notion when it comes to economics for example you should have a free market um lighter state lighter taxes more power to the individual and the state only exists for two big reasons usually to deal with crime from within so a lot of funding for policing and attacks from without hence strong military to protect yourself other than that when it comes to things like education health care and culture this is more up to the individual to provide and make sense of our communities or society or voluntary sectors and something like that and so and a lot of the founding of the united states more or less was based on a tom pain and people like this who wanted to break from historic religion and historic state because they saw it as oppressive limiting their freedom their liberty and they saw the founding of the united states whether the pilgrims or others as a new jerusalem a new start in which they could think through a religion politics economics community in a different way and so that anglo american tradition has a certain wariness of the state on a whole range of levels because of a certain experience and so this this weaning from you know the english tradition was an attempt to using our liberty and freedom to build something new from the grassroots up whether it was religious elements of your own dutch tradition would be a part of that as well as a whole range of other groups meninites and you name them whereas the anglo-canadian tradition canada never cut the umbilical cord with england in the same way the united states was we remain very connected and because of that the i mean the two dominant forms of religion in canada initially were roman catholic and anglican whereas the united states those were seen as the problem essentially and then we also had a high view of the state and the role of the state in providing for the common wheel and higher taxes so that things like education eventually and health care and national broadcasting systems like the bbc cbc and canada and a variety of other things could be maintained so that the common good of a people could be and we were all responsible via the state and society for providing the common good and that's a tori tradition which we drew from going back to earlier than richard hooker in the 16th century you get the the carolyn divide you get jonathan swift you get the great high romantics of england collerage and wordsworth it's also these people at the forefront of ecological issues long before ecological issues you know became prominent so you read for example robert suddy's work seen as a high tori and it's robert nisbett a great american book he did in conservatism he said you read suddy for example it's left of communism and this is toriism and so canada inherited that so our great thinkers in canada from our pre you know confederation 1867 mcdonald and all who was a contemporary of disraeli he read disraeli's works he's very impacted by the high romantics in terms of the organic common wheel and the connection between past present and future our responsibility to pass on those goods via society and the state and so the anglo-canadian tradition is very different in what it's trying to conserve we are conserving different traditions and one goes much older than lock and tom pain and david hugh and adam smith we're conserving something much older than that and so when you get roger scrutin for example he's seen as a conservative but he's essentially conserving the work of you know john lock adam smith and edmund burke and because burke and smith were very good friends and people think burke is on you know old conservatism you know smith is smith is market economy wealth of nations but in fact both were pre american revolution they were very much for it very much for the role of the entrepreneur a certain suspicion of the state and so there's this whole tradition in the states that is conservative but of a burkeian lockian smithian more anarchist tom pain which doesn't exist in canada because and this would be my to some degree critique in the article i did was this critique of scrutin roger scrutin that his this is why he's popular in the united states because he he continues that that tradition of first of all the sacred versus the second or not not either or it's that the the secular is it's you know shaped by it should be embraced by the sacred and this of course for many think conservative contra secular modernity they say oh okay this is real conservatism in which you honor the sacred versus the ideology of the the secular so that and a tori obviously would share that with him that's in terms of that simplistic dualism which has occurred between say but then how do you translate the sacred into the secular when it comes to economics or the arts or culture or politics or religion that then becomes for someone with a interested in the relationship religion politics that becomes an interesting question what's the role of the state and society in working towards a good culture a good civilization and this is where anglo canadian toriism most people like toriism they think of monarchy and the queen and the king and all that that's that's missing the essence of of a way of a world view and so this is where you get differences between anglo canadian toriism and anglo-american conservatism this is why scrutine has been very popular in the united states whether it's burke or lock he he plays into that narrative of american history of which certain elements obviously of the english tradition were a part of oh and and you know it's that was very very helpful to me because you know that just upped the resolution on a whole bunch of history for me and also i think explains some of the interesting dynamics of peterson's popularity in the states as well now for for me so right now in my own denomination you know the we just had our executive director resign over issues regarding binationality so the christian reform you're in the frazier valley there there there are many places in the united states and canada where no one will have any understanding what the christian reform church is but frazier valley you know abots for there plenty of christian reform churches around you'll bump into christian reform students in your university same for toronto and so one of the one of the interesting tensions going on right now in the christian reform church has been binationality because the longer the the immigration in so my great-grandfather came as a 19 year old to bring his father over and settled in western michigan so the american diaspora locations were western michigan new jersey iowa and then after the war iowa and then after the second world war you had another wave of dutch immigration much of which went to canada california but obviously the hollanders leaving the netherlands in the 19 late 1940s early 1950s were very different individuals than a lot of the freesian and rural individuals and jews like my own family who left in the towards the end of the 19th century and now they all in the christian reformed world the christian from church kind of became a place for dutch immigrants but now the you know with with 50 75 years of soaking in the juices of either the united states or canada some of those forces are differentiating and it's been interesting watching the reaction i mean i've i've obviously in a small denomination like the christian reform church i remember very interesting starting to talk about jordan peterson of whom many people in let's say ontario were quite familiar he had been in ontario public television a lot of canadian saying why would you listen to that guy because he was just sort of that guy on ontario public television but then of course when peterson sort of peterson starts showing up on fox news and you know starts showing up with american political conservatives someone people starting to send me some old video of peterson making some more direct political commentary maybe a decade ago that didn't sound anything in alignment with american conservatism but you're sort of mapping this out in terms of the oh how shall we say it you know this this also gets into some of my the difference between the christian reform church and the reform church of america of which there's very little in canada is is very much the difference between the state church and the free church of which some of the same ancient not ancient but some of these same lines are sort of tracking because of course the the christian reform church with with abram kiper was sort was a you know a separation from the state church founds the free university of amsterdam has you know has the polarization of society i mean kiper's attempt at some principled pluralism as opposed to much more of this imagination where church and state are can church and state sort of function in an analogous way as opposed to let's say an adversarial way in some of the free church movements and i was just before we were talking i was i was reading some of your wild bird book on erasmus again you know probably noting some of those differences coming through in that too erasmus who's who remained a loyal subject of the roman church whereas luther you know begins with some you know with some wanting to do some conversation academic conversation but of course when you know as the as the conflict ensues it gets polarized very quickly which of course forces the rupture which which also has all sorts of other lines they're not simply theological differences there's cultural differences there's political differences on and on and on so you know that that your framing and and description of of some of these delineations is very helpful and interesting as these things sort of continue to work on down through through the decades and in fact centuries crossing in some uncomfortable ways over these political lines yeah can you see me paul yep yep you're fine okay somehow i'm you're not coming through to me oh okay no i've i've got your picture just fine so i i assume it'll it'll probably when the internet thing clears up i don't know if you were able to hear me or follow what i was saying yes i also think it's interesting when we think of in the dialogue with scrutin and peterson and it's part of that they slip into sometimes an either or way of thinking and when they dealt with education it was essentially a bad mouthing of public education it's the bastion of leftist thinking cultural marxism post-modernism and so there was this this tendency again to pit freedom against the public education which is ideological and merely is a breeding ground for variations of left leftist thinking so just as you have a suspicion of the state which is public now in the area of education there's a suspicion of that and of course in that particular dialogue they were putting forward the the potential thoughts of alternate forms of education so elements of that you get in the reform you know private education homeschools private so again that liberty versus public institutions like state or education yep and so that that's an interesting thing in that particular dialogue between scrutin and peterson is this either or the world is problematic it demeans it distorts authentic politics and religion so we have to start our own communities our own forms of education our own forms of culture and literature and and the arts and music so there's this either or tendency almost a manichaean dualism which simplifies complexity it was interesting to me in that in that um in that talk too i mean peterson peterson is so often again because of his appearance on fox news and how he was received south of the border but but when i listen to him i often think you know he's far more moderate because even with his talk with scrutin peterson for a while was advocating that certain gender studies um critical race studies some of these things be defunded you know there was a time in in in 2018 when he was talking a lot about that but as opposed to say someone like kiper and my tradition which basically said nuts to the whole thing we're going to start alternative institutions and um peterson you know peterson where he would complain about the you know uh public funding of these institutions didn't really seem to go all the way in terms of he talked about you know creating alternative ways of of of education but you know one of my long term critiques of peterson has been insufficient institutional attention to a lot of his ideas um and i think i was gonna say i think that also comes out with uh in the discussion with scrutin in terms of not scrutin doesn't play it out um in an overt way over a period of time but when it comes to actually um institutional church life uh for scrutin he is committed to place to locality to perish to people and it's from this commitment and loyalty even though being critical this is the birth of renewal of a culture uh you don't see peterson has a very weak ecclesiology if he has one at all which i don't i don't think he has and so in that sense scrutin's understanding of religion is grounded in local parochial life whereas peterson's understanding of religion it's still very much an idea uh in his head but not grounded in local communal life and in that sense scrutin is more deeply conservative in a sort of a liberal conservative sense he still believes in the parish community the people place time whereas peterson is not connected at all to local communities and of course flying all over the place and you know grappling with i mean that's important but uh it's also part of conserving uh you know conservatism in the older sense is not just religion in your head it's religion is being integrated knit together with people uh within community at a local level and in that sense scrutin understands conservatism uh of a certain variety in a different way than peterson who's still uh to somewhat disconnected from local uh parish denominational institutional life yeah well and and i would think this perhaps explains a bit about peterson's inability to to to land as it were with a community or even to form one he he can't he can't be divorced from the state because in a or from politics because in a sense that's all he has as opposed to again looking at you know my heritage in the in the free church free university the the dutch um the dutch reformed um and i won't say anti-state but pushing against the state opposition tended to their own separate institutions and so the vision was um you know the vision was well keep the state again in sort of this south of the border imagery keep the state smaller and allow other institutions to flourish and of course this then gets worked out i don't know how much you know about abram kiper but he became sort of a patron saint of of calvin college and the dutch reformed in some ways i think a lot of that in north america that that has taken different paths in canada than it has south of the border because again south of the border that sort of merged with other revolutionary small state conservatives who so you had your let's say your dispensational christian school versus your dutch reformed christian school now of course theologically the dutch reformed would look at the dispensational with horror um but as as theological self-understanding diminishes the political conservatism tends to come together whereas the kyperians who go to canada um i think in some ways have lost some of their anti-state ethos and and have their institutions more in alignment with states and so when i look at some of the the the chatter and some of the conflicts between canadian pastors you see these you know these historical tensions sort of working their way through but i think as you as you mentioned it it becomes quite significant that jordan whereas he he's theoretically fascinated by religion and attacked by the other members of the intellectual dark web for being insufficiently critical of religion at the same time he he does not have a church home or a community in fact he you know sort of a joke founds his own denomination of which he is the only member with a very interesting patron saint as its namesake and um and and then that but but what's been fascinating to me is how it was actually a a a debunking atheist uh youtube that has you know probably paid as much attention to jordan peterson as i have noted how he he never really sort of brings people to the edge of christianity but it's always people who take the next step and then for the most part that next step for many people has been the orthodox church which is again fundamentally a fascinating choice yeah and what's i think yeah actually there were three people in the book that we did on peterson from the orthodox tradition that um were going to contribute and then it just got to be too much for them at the end and um uh so yeah there's definitely this the dilemma for me of the orthodox tradition north america it um because some of these people who get drawn to orthodoxy they themselves have come from some sort of a fundamentalist or conservative evangelical background in which we know what's right we know what's wrong the world out there is nasty our little enclave is right and so when they go to orthodoxy it's just another form of fundamentalism with tradition is that we're the true church historically uh so so in terms of worldview the content of the worldview has changed the structure of the worldview is still simple black and white you know and that the orthodox tradition maintains the truth of the historic churches embodied in the patristic era and particularly the eastern version of it of the fathers of the and so it's still that mindset of of we know what's right what's true and this is sort of form of neo-puretanism or gnosticism as eric foglen would use use the word or i'll be there'll be comments from you using that word ron nosticism or well i mean underneath it is words like we're the pure ones yeah if you differ with us then it proves you probably don't understand either religious or political or cultural reality gnosticism when upgraded into a political term like eric foglen does in the new science of politics it's just a a greek word that means to know and the gnostics knew the great truths of spirituality better than the historic church again you're into we know you don't know uh so you just politicize the term or make it a religious term it's that you're into that dualism again and that lack of and we were going we probably won't get a chance this time but it's the same sort of clash between luther and erasmus is that it's just luther knew what genuine faith was and how you interpret the bible in a certain way and how you interpret the fathers in a certain way and erasmus was much more nuanced in how that was understood and and that sort of wisdom tradition which tries to find a middle way between the gnosticism of we know or the agnosticism of we can't say anything all this perspective the wisdom way tries to live in the tension between knowing and not knowing sort of the picture we had of peterson a more difficult tightrope to walk though have our i've been having some conversations with a roman catholic diocese theologian out of regina who has written this book transubstantiation and it got it got sent to me and you know i my channel is small but i guess large enough that certain christian publishing houses now sort of want but brett is brett this is this is a fascinating book and i think you might enjoy it because what what brett really tries to do is argue that in some ways luther and calvin misunderstood aquinas and um anyway um you might you might want to you might want to check that out no and i you know very much where this conversation is going very much sort of lands back with erasmus and luther and you know your recommendation to me a number of months ago of fatal discord which um which i read with relish i thought it was a i don't know if you're using it as a textbook for any of your classes but i thought for me it was one of the best it was one of the best books i had read on that period and and really helped flesh out um that period for me you know i like many so if you get an if you get an education in the christian reform church through your christian day schools and then high school and then calvin college and calvin seminary there's a particular take on the reformation that um you would imagine from a tradition like this these are our people these are our saints they made the right decisions our institutions are based on these things and so it's um it's i thought fatal discord was was tremendously helpful in in fleshing out some of this now at the beginning of your at the beginning of your book wild bird um you made the you made the point that the english um some of the english reformation uh lights are were insufficiently um appreciated that the um that in a sense the antagonists like luther you know those who broke were um you know they they in some ways are overshadowing the more erratic um individuals now now this gets interesting though when it comes again to institutions because i i really appreciate you know what you said about it's probably going to get me in trouble but about the orthodox because part of my fascination with the when the orthodox church moves to america you have immigrants from eastern europe from greece i had a very interesting conversation with an individual who was worshipping in a christian reform church in my area who grew up greek orthodox um and then he just you see this dynamic where i find people coming oh can you hear me can you hear me karen i think it's just your internet i think it's just your internet ron uh it should come back okay are you back uh yeah okay okay the orthodox church of the orthodox church comes to america via these immigrant groups and of course i have some association with that because the immigrant roots of my church are very are still very fresh um the immigrant the children of immigrants are bored and the the new folks coming out of jordan peterson are fascinated but but here again the role of institutions uh plays into it because the the refugees of various evangelical and dispensational groups what they love about the orthodox is that here is our institution it's older than your state and that then sets up you know interestingly again a dynamic of this is the orthodox will never be a state church um in north america and so you have this new renaissance of orthodoxy ironically like many of the other immigrant churches had a renaissance when they came to uh land without an established church and so again again i think you're i mean what you laid out for me earlier in this has been very helpful and you know seeing some of these tensions through the reformation period are also helpful because of course the reformation happens about the same time as states are developing and of course you know the the experience of the reformation in france which already had a very vibrant monarchy and spain as opposed to the holy roman empire but then of course england is the outlier because here you have a developed the monarchy and via henry the eighth you have and so then the english path goes very different i just dumped a whole bunch of stuff that maybe is not sufficiently connected but um yeah the often what happens is the european reformation of the 16th century is played up whether it's the lutheran the reform the anabaptist the baptist and the more complex the more complex layered nature of the english reformation is often not known and so you get this discussion of the 16th century for many which just ignores the layered nature of the english reformation i'd say another thing which is interesting that's happening now with covod is you get a lot of the sort of the end times or eschatological birds are being beat out of the bush you know the world's going world's the world is moving in a direction in which dark clouds are moving in we have to we have to be alert to how we protect ourselves so you get benedict option you get end times thinking this is no different than the 16th century once again luther was prey to this erasmus was very suspicious of this way of thinking he was thinking long term and you always get penny penny types or doomsday criers or the world is coming to an end or eschatological profit saying you know history is is winding winding down and of course you throw a crisis like this in then you get the people retreating into their own own own worlds and so sometimes the sociology of crisis begets fragmentation over how you interpret the crisis in a divine theological way and if people disagree with me then that proves they don't understand the sine i word for this moment how do you think peterson and and it's i want to ask you this because you live in western canada but you live in southwestern canada how does peterson's in a sense frontier i mean his his parents were his father was a a a public school teacher um and so an employee of the state peterson went on to become an employee of i is university of toronto i don't know how it works in canada's university of toronto um owned by owned by the state or is it a yeah it's funded it's a public university okay okay so but peterson you know one of the things that came out early too was friends of mine from alberta and northern alberta of which there are christian churches up there um peterson in that score on on this how does his you know alberta of course great oil money how does that play into this conversation well alberta is probably our most right of center province in canada it's one of the most in the american terms republican or canada certain type of conservatism it's where our present conservative party came out of of steven harper and stockwell day and preston manning and it's it's very much that frontier sort of a province and so it's very much the individual making and shaping and standing on their own two feet to resist the the challenges of time and the winds and the you know and where there is a communal sense it's we we do it to some degree independent of the state you can't trust the state and the clash between in canada the federal government and alberta has a long long history and of course they've been able the albertans to tap into the gold of oil the black gold of oil which has allowed them but of course the federal government historically has said that's just not alberta just doesn't own that that is a canadian ownership you know so i needless to say the albertans are get quite miffed something like that it's we share things communally and of course that it's and of course our present prime minister was his father that really tried to uh insist that the albertan oil was canadian oil it was an albertan oil and nationalize our petroleum industry and of course this offended them so there's a great distaste for our present prime minister given his father's position on this but peterson comes out of that in one sense the individual shaping and making their own history their own destiny and not giving up before the you know the challenges of time and the difficulties and the tragedies of the are all to human journey and that's very much an albertan myth uh in that sense which distinguishes it from significant elements say british columbia or other provinces in canada and this is and in that sense to understand peterson it is important to understand his albertan context he grew up in fairview a little we a little wee town in northern alberta north of edmonton and so those those roots but he's enough of a canadian to know that social welfare policy funded through taxation and public education is important so he's he lives in this tension uh between a certain canadian ethos of the common good but also the role of the uh individual making their own way in history and time uh independent of the state which is often seen as the problem which limits your freedom uh where do you think where do you think so peterson is you know certainly i think we both we both very much want to see him heal up rest um i i'd very much like to see um i'm anxious to see what the what book number two looks like um i'm very curious i mean uh 12 rules for life was one of the things that i was quite interested in about 12 rules for life was how uh transparent and personal he was in the book particularly the the the end of the book where he writes quite openly about you know his his daughter's medical troubles what that did to to him and his wife i'm i'm hoping that um he he continues to be able to be uh to share himself in the second book because obviously you know we just know little bits of it that have been disclosed by his daughter and by others in terms of the medical journey which he's been on which has been unusual to say the least including a medical pilgrimage to to russia which isn't something that that many of us um many of us imagine it will be interesting but it'll be interesting to see what if there is a second wave for jordan partly because i think the first wave which i sort of mark from c16 to summer of 2019 first wave was has to be understood very much in terms of trump presidency and i mean that that that entire i mean especially in terms of understanding jordan south of the border now we have a pandemic as you said rightly um even the most ardent free marketers become absolute socialists in demanding that the government the american government pull out the credit card and quickly put two trillion dollars and counting on the national bill um and you know flood you know keep individuals and institutions up during this time of crisis i don't think any of us have any clear idea what post pandemic america or canada looks like or how long this period will be both medically and economically so it will be very interesting to see what jordan's next book looks like and the world in which this book will be received because i think for wave number one of jordan the man and the moment found each other and that came that created the response that we saw any any thoughts on on looking forward well yeah i think historic moments will often cross the paths with ideology and where ideology has to be rethought given a historic moment and historic moment we're facing is obviously the covet 19 and so this raises the question for even any minimally thoughtful person is how are we to work through this publicly via the state and society rather than badmouthing the state and um or seeing it as the problem or public education is the problem or not being connected to any religious community in any meaningful sense so both the issue of pandemic and then the economic ripple effect from that pandemic is going to i think raise an interesting challenge for peterson in terms of how do you articulate how community both in the health way and the economic way comes together to support one another over the next few years it's not up to the because there there isn't peterson this element of individualism the sovereignty of the individual he realizes it's not just the individual versus community but if the individuals don't keep their own house in order then you can't just say community is going to do it for you on the other hand a community via the state and society have to work together in crisis situations so i mean he did his b.a in political science he has tended historically and he thinks left he takes worst case stories so whether it's you know whether it's china or whether it's you know solzhenitsin in russia or whether it's fascism or whether it's nazism some form of leftist or rightist communalism he's very suspicious of but there's a healthy form of status communalism as well and i think this crisis if he's going to grapple with that beyond just the sovereignty of the individual but the role of the individual in an organic sense with the larger community i mean that could that for him could up the level of his understanding in terms of individual state community and how these work together for the common the common good and i think most republicans in the states conservatives in canada recognize and very clearly you can't demean the state in a crisis like this so whether it's you know our health federally and provincially funded by the state politics funded by the state these are all something that we have to work together to work through this so i would think if he ventures forth into more political thinking in terms of state society i think this will probably be his next challenge well it'll be interesting to see i have you seen um have you seen ross douthat's book uh the decadent society no i haven't seen that is it good or yeah it's very good it it for at least for me doubt that was able to appropriate the word decadence to highlight a dynamic of our time and especially in a a period where i mean we mentioned sort of an apocalyptic end of the world i mean the left has its own version of apocalypticism today uh environmental you know environmental degradation on and on and so individuals like eric weinstein brett and eric weinstein you know brett of course coined this term or eric coined the term the idw eric and brett have have sort of continued in their way as sort of the left wing of the idw but also their apocalyptic vision that you know and of course because they're more on the left dramatic state action needs to be taken in order to forestall you know the coming apocalypse um where did i get through from peterson so so so so douthat comes along and says you know perhaps it's not necessarily perhaps it's not necessarily an apocalyptic vision perhaps there's this there's this decadence that we're in which is just basically a long slow decline it's it's been very interesting um and and so then peterson i think in some ways peterson fell into a certain sort of decadence in the last segments of his of his wave where the book tour if you listen to the the lectures these you know he he had this massive book tour you know 165 cities um you know speaking off the cuff every night to a different crowd sort of masked as a book tour but it's really sort of ongoing thing but not a lot of newer interesting things coming out of those talks the it tended to be the same themes that he had put out there um the the focus tended to be more and more political less and less i think philosophical or religious which were obviously the things that i was more interested in more and more tending to i think especially sometimes being paired with dave rubin play to the crowd which is in in my opinion a sure sign of decadence that these are my these are my reliable applause lines um keep giving the crowd what i want so or what what i know they respond well to playing to the base which is of course something that donald trump in american politics has has done in you know to extreme degrees it'll be very interesting again that's why i'm very curious to see what the second book looks like because if he comes back and sort of continues on the same trajectory he had been on the book tour i think it will it will we'll just see a we'll just see continued decadence and that nothing new nothing interesting and then without the push of the swell of the broader political religious forces he could sort of continues quietly into the future yeah and there's different ways of obviously defining decadence the left will define it in certain ways the right will define it in certain ways i've just as you know finished teaching augustin's great work the city of god 22 books and of course augustin is grappling with the decadence of late roman culture and civilization yeah and in each of those 22 books that are theological a philosophical an ethic a mythic a cultural a literary level he explores the layered nature and of decadence and how there's decadence on the left and there's decadence in the right and there's decadence in the center and each group will tend to elevate their own notion of the good and then define the other as decadent with without seeing the decadence in their own eyes and soul it's the old what jesus said the mote beam syndrome yeah and so we can always and so yeah so it's once you put content to decadence then all these different ideological tendencies in different ways tend to idealize their own position and see the other as the problem again you're back into that lutheran dualism that that manichaeanism that black and white way of slipping into tribalism or intellectual clannishness and so yeah so it will depend if if if peterson is just continuing to beat the same drum and say the same things he'll he'll inevitably have an audience but anyone who isn't growing in their understanding increasingly people then move on to some new guru who's articulating things in ways that speak to them at different levels so i hope there's a maturation to the degree you know he's overworked the soil and it's not producing the crops perhaps the soil of his soul needs to lie fallow for a couple years because often we work the soil literally of soil a farmer or the soil of our soul too much inevitably it doesn't produce the fruit the crops that we need and so sometimes a Sabbath of the soul or the soil is necessary and i hope he just doesn't get up and get you know on the treadmill again just as fast as he has been going as you say on that tour which is that's something that just isn't healthy for anybody yeah yeah so um any anything anything you're writing now ron what have you been working on well i'm doing all sorts of interviews on this book on peterson from a variety of people some coming from very right of center perspectives some from centrist perspectives some from more leftist perspectives so that's keeping me busy i also had my recent book on herman hess released called phoenix arising okay so continuing my work on herman hess in that way interesting enough interesting enough peterson draws a lot from carl jung hess knew young personally he initially began as a client of of carl jung and then he became the best of friends with carl jung there's almost exact contemporaries and so when you read when you read herman hess's many mythic stories he he not only knew the writings of young but he knew carl jung and the youngian tradition and the youngian tradition very very well and so it's interesting to compare hess's approach to carl jung and jordan peterson's read of the young freud tradition because hess lived in switzerland and carl jung comes out of a swiss context as i said they're they're contemporaries they knew one another and so i'm quite interested in how hess is probably one of the most proliferate prolific german writers german swiss writers of the 20th century engaged young in these larger political issues of his time so is your book out yet or is it yeah yeah yeah no you can get an amazon it's just called herman hesse colon phoenix arising i think i mentioned before that herman hess was probably the most important european writer in the united states in the counterculture era of the late 50s 60s and 70s main steppenwolf the band it took it from the name comes from hess's book steppenwolf timothy leary wrote about hess colin you know wilson's the outsider he was picked up by the counterculture but really misread by the counterculture and so in the last 10 or 15 years there's been a total rereading of hess in which the real mature hessa emerges not the ideological and selective read of them by the counterculture of the 50s 60s and 70s so i'm interested in this renaissance that's why i call it phoenix arising resurrection of hessa as an important cultural literary spiritual political thinker of for our time and what he can contribute any there's a lot of overlap then with him and him and peterson and uh scrutin and many of these other people and uh what's happened sadly is frederick nichi has been given all the attention at the present time and yet has engaged nichi constantly in his writings but because of s got connected to the counterculture it passed by he passed with it he's sort of been marginalized but i'm trying to do what i can to bringing back in his critique of nichi as well and so the has critiqued of nichi even though we engage nichi and virtually all of his novels and all of his writings so it's also a way of of engaging the present um genuflecting to nichi amongst many both on the right and the left interesting it's it's it's not on it's not on kindle maybe not on kindle yet i don't i don't i don't know what you need to do ron to do uh to do some audiobooks but i'd recommend it because i do a lot of i do a lot of my booking via audiobooks because i have time in the car and time doing dishes and time shopping and a lot of people can't listen to books that way but i i can do a whole lot of things when my mind is engaging with a book i should see how i can get it chay i've had a few friends say uh i should get it also on kindle and you're right about that yes that's a very good idea and and i know you know i i mean we talked a little bit about hasa i know very little little about him but in you know again reading some of your book wild bird you mentioned nicha and hasa and and i think um yeah i think it would be helpful to to continue to bring in i mean again i one of the huge gifts that jordan gave countless people was to sort of ignite their uh their desire for intellectual pursuit and opened up new veins of inquiry and that um and i think there there are there are many many people out there who who owe jordan a debt for that and again you saw that you saw that as a professor where where he very much caught the imagination of of many individuals so i think expanding the conversation into more individuals like hes and and others will probably be able to to build on a lot of the contributions that jordan has has given us so yeah absolutely i think you're right is that um peterson jordan peterson has really for many um he's been a key in the ignition starter he stands at the door and points uh he not only points but some of the work he's even done on nichi is is quite commendable where he'll take you know paragraphs and some of the key nichian works and um carl young and dusty asky and some of these kirkkegaard some of these key thinker souls and nits and and uh i think it's awakened people who are you know they're sensitive but they're they're wanting some meaningful pointers on their soul journey he's given them that and uh and that is you know highly commendable yeah yeah well thank you again ron i've i always enjoyed my conversations with you i i come away just learning a ton you're a wonderful teacher and you just continue to open up new horizons for me oh well thank you and i i don't know what happened to my screen it just said zoom but you've got all the picture do you i've got all the picture everything has come through quite well and um and so no i'll i'll post this tomorrow on the channel okay send it through and you do and i'll send it to others as well wonderful thank you ron take care you too bye bye
