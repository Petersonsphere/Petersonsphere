 Hi, this is Paul. I hope you've been enjoying all the conversations. I've been having I've just not had time to sit down and make another really long video and the video that I've been wanting to make for a while has been the video on the subject of Well, why the fight over woke religion a couple of weeks ago I had a conversation with James Lindsay and I was very happy with the way that conversation went I had never met James. I had reached out to him He was very gracious and and giving me some time to talk to me and I thought the conversation was very productive I certainly enjoyed it and got a lot out from it one of the things that I hadn't realized until I spoke with him was the way in which the new atheist community has been split by this new woke religion and I was I was struck when I first got the news of the grievance scholar paper project and and and what interested me was how of the three Peter Boghossian was the only name that I recognized and I recognized his name from some conversations he had with Phil Visser and his manual for creating atheists And so I knew he was kind of a I hope he takes no offense if he ever watches this He's kind of a a B level if you have the four horsemen there the a level it's kind of a B level new atheist and I thought it was interesting that he was part of this little conspiracy to out the fake science of the grievance studies and it wasn't until I talked to James that it was able to kind of put it together and realize that Where this battle is in terms of the the new atheist movement? That's been around for really a couple of decades Now I've said in many of my other videos that I think the culture war that the West is currently Experiencing is a Christendom culture war a Christendom civil war and and the fight against atheist woke Religion is a new atheist civil war and again I didn't realize that until I talked to James and and in many ways this is the battle for the Bible for the scientific crowd now Those of you who may not know a lot of church history might not know that in the after Darwin in the late 19th early 20th century there was a huge battle between what were called the modernists and the fundamentalists and One of the one of the key books that came out of that period came from J Gresham Machin from what was called at least when I was in seminary in the 80s the old Princeton school Because what was happening was that there was a an existential crisis within Christianity in Europe and America over science versus religion and as this as this as This comic in the center has you have people imagined at least Christians imagined that this was a steady decline of Loss of the faith down through these stairs of the Bible is not infallible Not man is not made in God's image no miracles no virgin birth no deity no atonement no Resonate no resurrection agnosticism atheism and this was kind of the liberal staircase downwards from faith into no faith and So we've lived with this dynamic for a long time and what happened during that period of time was that there was a big fight over institutions and it was happening in Every college and every seminary around the United States and what tended to happen was that seminary that seminaries proliferated for example the old Princeton school where J Gresham Machin taught became liberal and Westminster Theological Seminary was formed in Philadelphia Pennsylvania as kind of the conservative alternative and and this this happened throughout the United States now It's important to remember that a few decades before that similar things had happened with respect to Abolition and slavery that was very much a north-south split But but this split was all that was all through the West as they were grappling with What does the rise of Darwinian science mean and and so then kind of old? Atheism came up and then in the 80s and 90s and aughts we had we had new atheism and the things that were and this is something that many of us are familiar with every Easter the Freedom from Religion Foundation in Sacramento will put up a billboard like this guy and I've had the picture in before What I realized is that well, obviously the new atheists are not fighting a battle of the Bible they are fighting a battle of science and a battle of knowledge and a battle of Basically in terms of the foundations of their world now I'm not going to run through the the history of of science and religion and the Reformation and the turn to texts and the turn away from texts. I've run through that history in a number of my other videos I'm just going to refer to it here, but this this woke religion So when when Peter Boghossian and James Lindsay and Helen Pluckrose and others note that what they're seeing is Is not so much science in the Academy but a religion that of course in a new atheist Context is a slur. They're they're basically saying, you know You're religious just like all these other people that we've defeated now one of the things that Comes up again and again people send me letters because of my channel and they talked to me about How why they became an atheist? Maybe they were raised Christian, but they became an atheist because they'd see the new atheist in their mind beat Christian apologists again and again on stage now part of the dynamics of these Conversations if you watch the Jordan Peterson Matt Dillahunty Jordan Peterson Sam Harris conversations is that so often both groups leave Unconvinced simply hardened in their allegiance to whichever side they came into the theater with so it's those those Events aren't exactly the kind of thing that people would like them to be Usually it's people going in there to cheer their heroes but what's happening with this with the hoax papers and with this new movement and with its Relationship with religion which I think is very right if you listen to my conversation with James Lindsay I think he and I are very much on the same page that this is a religion and and I came to this because I began to see in you know four or five years ago this the development of this within Christian churches and the more I listen the more I began to say something similar to what say Jay Gresham Machin was saying is that this is very much a religious movement now I wouldn't be surprised by that seeing it in a church, but this is distinct from the Christianity that That I was expecting to see and so Increasingly I began to call it progressive liberationism because I began to see it as distinct from say traditional Christianity or the confessional Christianity that was supposed to be What that which is practiced in the Christian Deformed Church and so I began to study it and get Tried to figure out what was going on and as I was continuing to think about that and research that that's where I came across Jordan Peterson and even though And so then things were starting to sort of fit together for me And that's in a sense how I got into this and then when I saw Peter Boghossian and James Lindsay talking it was like Yeah, this is what I've been studying all along But I'm not part of the new atheist camp looking at these guys I'm part of the camp in the Christian Church watching this same thing happen in the church now terms are sometimes different but It's amazing how much it's the same and I'm gonna talk about that as we go in this a little bit more But let's first talk about the the schism in the new atheists one of the things that One of the things that's helpful for me looking at this new religion as a pastor is I know religion and I and there are Already categories that I can employ To give a little bit of my own to lay some of my own cards on the table. I think religions are Religions are ways that we answer basic questions about the world and that's very close to Jordan Peterson's definition of these are the Axiomatic principles that we hold within us and expressed by our actions Expressed by the values that we articulate in language. This is our religion and this is why When Jordan Peterson called Sam Harris and Matt Dillahunty Religious and in fact Christian or at least Christian ish they took offense But to me there's no question about that because they are in the war in the to borrow some terminology From the woke religion or the progressive liberationist. They're very much downstream from Christianity and they're not owning A lot of the formation that they simply have picked up in terms of their culture and they don't realize what part of Christianity they have simply assumed In terms of the moral system that they share with a great many of their allies and adversaries But now in terms of the the the new atheist community and where this schism is happening part of what we see are what I would call gradual Gradualist utopians and aggressive utopians. So for example, Sam Harris, I would say would be a gradualist utopian and that he imagines when he's talking to Jordan Peterson that Reason is going to continue to grow and eventually prevail Okay, and and this is very much a page taken from the early 20th century when it was imagined that religion will continue to recede And reason will flourish and religion will be put away and will all become rational and so on and so forth and As Jordan Peterson noted, he doesn't believe that and frankly neither do I but politics and education are the means of progress and if so If someone is is showing themselves to be religious what they really need is education and education in science and education in philosophy and math and hopefully this religious superstition can pass away But but this but this will be done individually and and with liberty. There's not going to be any witch trials here. No guns to the head We want to persuade people with arguments and the new atheists this is this is what they've done They want to persuade people with arguments and they've often felt that religion has been tyrannical and religion has been And no, I gotta hang on. I gotta turn off that computer noise. So basically the the gradualist utopians like Sam Harris Believe that that with freedom of speech with good conversation with good education people can be liberated from their religious superstition And the world will get increasingly secular and rational and then life will be better. That's that's basically their agenda That's part of their eschatology and it's a pretty good example of that and it's a pretty good example of that And religion though is defined as an ancient mythos thinking that's key here because they would argue that they're not religious because they're secular atheist Now that depends on your definition of religion now Jordan Peterson and I both would say no you really are religious secularism is a sort of religion atheism Okay, you say just atheism is not believing that they're religious. They're not religious. They're not religious Okay, you say just atheism is not believing that there's a god I would say yeah But there's a system that comes around it a group of axiomatic beliefs that are getting expressed and that are getting acted out and so Religion is is simply a function of all human beings in terms of our axiomatic behavior Whereas they would say religion is is ancient mythos thinking and that will be replaced and will recede before science and technology And that's the subtraction story that Charles Taylor talks about But but the new woke religionists are really aggressive utopians and and getting increasingly tyrannical as as we've been seeing Politics and social engineering are a means of progress Whereas the gradualist utopians are imagining that good argumentation people will slowly come of their own free will And we can take our time but bit by bit we'll we'll get creation science and prayer and all of those things out of the school And real science will develop will our freedom from religion foundations will increasingly stop things like prayer before Congress or before football games or some of these things and churches will continue to decline so on and so forth but the the aggressive utopians Really want to take hold and say it needs to happen faster than this because Lives are at stake and feelings are being hurt and and the patriarchy and white supremacy continue to be imbued in people around so We must eliminate these things by taking control of social institutions Including educational institutions and political institutions so we can rid the world of these unjust maladies So equity in that in that case is above liberty group is above individual And and someday you'll thank us after all and your children certainly will because it's for your own good There there's often an implicit elitism in the gradualist utopians, but there's a Usually a denied elitism, but a very aggressive one in the aggressive utopians because after all We need to save you and we need to save you quick now now religions, they're they're probably not quite as reactive to religions because Probably increasingly they'll see certain Christian groups as their allies In and for reasons that i'm going to get into in a little bit So so the new atheist schism one way we could We could categorize it would be that sam harris james lindsey peter begosian These continued peter uh jordan peterson these continue to be classical liberals Let's call them the right side of the schism versus the right versus the left now, of course many of these individuals sam harris and jordan peterson Politically in terms of the standard spectrum before the trump era would not have been considered on the right at all politically But now suddenly they are forced over to the right by the increasingly active Further left and so the woke warriors or the social justice warriors or the the woke religionists or the progressive Liberationists will consider them to be the left the classical liberals will Basically have a modernistic agenda objective truth first freedom of speech the world is a space of objects subjective experience follows objective arrangement or the perceptive of objective arrangement and Relationships in ian mcgill criss terms that they're very left-brained Now now the woke the woke warriors a subjective experience first this the injustice is felt and perceived And you might not be able to see it in an objective world, but it's certainly felt it's intuitive And and here this is a this is a difference between them and what we're going to find is that a lot of these cross pressures Begin going different ways as we begin to look how this new conflict realigns the old alliances so woke warriors see from subjective experience first I can feel the oppression against me and I can see the oppression and others and just by virtue of a connection with a magna hat the the covington boys were were seen as as I forget who wrote it the the the magna hat is the new white hood and and this isn't necessarily This isn't an objective truth. This is felt and Intuitive intuition and perception maps on to objects Okay, so the magna hat becomes the new white hood rearrange objects according to an intuitive Agenda we're going to feel our way through this to to find this landscape of justice and equity and freedom from discrimination of every sort very much models a therapeutic approach and compared especially to the classical liberals and the Objectivists over on the now to the right of them they it's very therapeutic It's very feeling issued and and at least initially they were adopting very therapeutic language but as you resist ongoing therapy and reeducation the Efforts get more and more determined and less and less voluntary and and so in some ways there They're a little bit more over here on the right brain. All right now meanwhile in religious communities like Christian communities This is making for some weird Scrambling and and actually in some ways left and right isn't probably the best way to approach it maybe a historical layer approaches best because in many ways the classical liberals that are the right wing of the of the new theists are Are very much left brain and and they will align because they've been classically budding heads with the left brains of the religious community Modernistic Protestants that that love to do apologetics have been the front line Against the the classical liberal new atheists. The emphasis has been on objective Texts, so now some of the the new teaching will Objectivists will say well, well that violates the text and the emphasis is on law now now this very much comes into play with the Questions of women in church office the questions of LGBT inclusion in church communities That's really where this where this new woke religion versus kind of the traditional religions practiced in denominations Really became enjoined in 2013 when for example the Supreme Court handed down their decision now You'll find that for the most part all of the all of the or the in the intellectual the the intellectual dark web with the exception of Ben Shapiro say Ben Shapiro is really kind of an outlier there because he's a traditional Religionist all right, and also sort of libertarian and so there's plenty of nuance, but all the rest of them will very quickly trot out their trot out their credentials in terms of LGBT issues or at least LG issues lesbian and gay issues, and that's where that that Faction is having some of its own cross pressures Internally so that and so of course Jordan Peterson gets hung up on pronouns in in c16 And this is where we really begin to see the rift in the new atheist communities But but this has been happening in religious communities not just Christian ones religious communities for a while But the left rain the left brain religious communities and again left brain sometimes. It's left sometimes It's right, but this is Ian McGill Chris talk his terminology emphasizing community unity and conformity okay the right brain religious communities emphasizing intuitive individual freedom over Conformities and so now before we really got into the woke religion battle That some of the battles were more between the left brain and right brain religious communities Now how can we track these changes? Some of the best ways to track a lot of changes in religion is to watch what's happening with food and sex You might think well, okay sex I can understand but food Food and sex traditionally and Are always show up as markers in religious communities because they will be either Prohibitions or liberties around food and sex and these very much often mark Transitions and kind of locate communities throughout time And I see them as sort of benchmarks for for seismic change Now now the reason we're so surprised that I would put food on that list is the deep impact of Protestant Libertarian food stance has obscured it for many Protestants will eat just about anything now when I was growing up the Roman Catholics in northern, New Jersey We're still eating fish on Friday, which meant that the deli just down the street from the bakery where I worked They had a wonderful fish on Friday used to love to get fish on Friday But we Protestants all going all the way back to the Reformation Protestants and Reformed Christians were sometimes known as sausage eaters and part of the reason they would eat sausage on no meat days And on fast days was to prove their their Christian liberty to their Roman Catholic adversaries and and you can see where food then becomes elements in these wars, all right now Those of you who live in California know that we have legislation about the feelings of chicken Chickens with respect to cage-free chickens or cage-free egg eggs from cage-free chickens know that you know suddenly Everybody's paying attention to food and if your children are going to public school in California You'll probably notice that somewhere in high school. Some of them will will suddenly become vegan because well now there's moral status in Food now now sex has obviously been another area that there's always a lot of movement and This has been there too now food and sex are two of our strongest Biological drives and this is part of the reason that you can always kind of look at what's going on with religious communities Ask someone what are you and aren't you allowed to eat? What is what is what is moral about food? What moral status will you lose by eating certain foods and will you gain by eating certain foods? So for example, if you eat a lot of beef you well, maybe you don't care about the environment if you're a vegan Well, why are you a vegan? Well, I I'm against Industrial farming and the cruelty that happens in animals or I'm a guest I'm against use of antibiotics or Growth hormones in animals and so on and so forth and and so you can see that even though we haven't really connected food Very strongly with religion Increasingly, we will see that. All right So you can track change by paying attention to moral discussions around food and sex Now now also as you listen to this pay attention to health because health is a loaded term Religions are always looking for flourishing or as Charles Taylor says fullness, but pay attention to how bounded by secularity or transcending into an afterworld or other word which health so You know, maybe you're maybe you're fasting during fast times as an Orthodox Christian or a Roman Catholic Christian or a Muslim or You're very scrupulous about being vegetarian as a Buddhist or a Hindu and You say well, what health are you looking for? Well, maybe you're looking for Spiritual health now now fasting is in the Protestant churches as well But Protestant fasting tends to be more episodic usually in connection with prayer rather than the church calendar in connection with feast days and holy days and Fasting periods as with lent and so again food is a pretty good tracker But but so is sex now just as you had kind of a Protestant libertarianism whitewash our ability to track food as a religious marker the dominance of the Protestant sexual ethic in the West has as kind of Obscured that and so the West had at least in the United States and Europe Sexual ethic didn't differentiate Roman Catholic and Protestant too much it did with respect to contraception but for the most part Protestants and Catholics have have had a similar sexual ethic and and it hasn't been far from let's say Buddhists or some other groups in some ways, you know again religion is enormously diverse And so it's hard to make easy quick categorizations, but but a lot of this has to do again with health is health perceived as this worldly health That would be partly the impact of secularism when you look at the dietary laws in the Old Testament of clean and unclean food often Modernists want to map on health to those laws, but biblical scholars have actually rejected this for quite a long time It's not health that they're dealing with they're dealing with symbolic representations of Metaphysical realities, okay and and which even with the Protestant sausage eating on Fridays Against Roman Catholics there too is in a sense a Theological mapping the Protestants wanted to talk about Religious freedom and the priesthood of all believers and one speed versus two speed so on and so forth But but now you'll find that that food and morality are increasingly linked again You've got individual liberty versus community and now in our society This tends to get played out more in vice areas like soda Do you have the the big sugar tax to to as a public health matter to lower obesity? How is alcohol regulated or controlled is there social stigma or status loss with drinking alcohol? You'll find that in some religious communities certain conservative Christian communities Islamic communities What about drugs? What about pot now pot legalization of pot is so new churches really haven't engaged in this or figure this out and As I've said in many other videos churches move at a very different clock speed than everyone else So that will probably take some time But over the next 20 years watch churches as they try to figure out what kinds of prohibitions there will be with respect to pop and other drugs that are legalized up this will get very interesting when it comes to psychedelics if the Conversation that is emerging this has all been new to me of the Jordan Peterson Movement as this comes to churches and again in California we've seen this as free-range chicken and eggs and I simply feel more moral by Eating a chicken that I imagined in terms of my projection of chicken Consciousness had a more humane life than an inhumane life and I don't say that that's a mock it But that's that's really sort of what we're talking about and and I don't say that as to dismiss Questions of animal cruelty animal cruelty has been an issue for many Christians actually animal cruelty was a very big issue for CS Lewis In order to locate this I wanted to pull up a very interesting question because if I talk about Christianity and LGBT issues that's been something that is very much a Topic of public conversation for example Mike Pence wife goes back to teaching at a Christian school that has that has pretty much traditional Christian teaching with respect to LGBT issues and same-sex marriage So then I think it's helpful to look at someone like the Dalai Lama because the Dalai Lama is someone for whom Many in the woke religion camp would say well We certainly don't want to align ourselves with these Christians who say no to same-sex marriage and all of these things We certainly have a great deal of esteem and respect for the Dalai Lama, but if you do any amount of googling you'll discover that Really should be to nobody's surprise the Dalai Lama's Conversations about sexuality have been interesting in in 1994 in an interview with out magazine He said if someone comes to me and asks whether homosexual Homosexuality is okay or not. I will ask what is your companion's opinion? But if you both agree then I would say two males or two females voluntarily agree to have mutual satisfaction without further Implications of harming others then it's okay. The interview was not available anywhere online So the context of the quote is not known but then you go to May 25 1999 the Dalai Lama says they want me to condone homosexuality But I'm a Buddhist and for a Buddhist a relationship between two men is wrong Some sexual contact in man some sexual contact in marriage is wrong speaking regarding masturbation and oral sex And I thought well that was interesting Also saying that if an individual has no faith then it's a different matter if two men love each other and are not religious Then that is okay by me and so what's interesting again, and this is typical of religion There's a lot of nuance here in terms of categories If you're a Buddhist, well, why is this? Why are the rules different if you're a Buddhist? Well, they're different if you're a Buddhist because your Buddhism is Contextualizing your life goals. That's how religion works You have a different set of axiomatic principles than a non Buddhist And so for the Dalai Lama he kind of susses out the the different the different norms with respect to Some of these different things now many of you listening to that might be a little bit surprised And okay and in keeping with that in 2014 He got asked this again and he said it's okay as long as you don't violate your chosen religion And so you can if you kind of understand how Buddhism works You might be able to see why the Dalai Lama would have the stance that he's had So but now start paying attention to where all of this is going health Health in what way is it tied to natural law? All right, or is it tied to is it tied to other? Metaphysical or metaphor or metaphorical stories that are playing Liberty well consenting adults but those who are really hoping that this idea of consent won't move anywhere should continue to pay attention to What is consent and what is it based on its base consent is based on a certain? anthropology a certain frankly religious anthropology a Question about what is a human being and what is choice and which human beings can offer choice and this obviously is built Into our laws now increasingly we see news popping up of celebrities and others raising children without gender Why because they believe that in a sense their children should consent to their gender mapping? And this is leading to a lot of the the questions about children transitioning Medically and having transitional surgery when they're still minors Transisting children with or without parental consent for the health the mental health The identity which is tied to mental health of the child. So again, you can begin to see all of this stuff track Now this has been making its way through the churches and for those of you paying attention to Christian Denomination some of the biggest fights that we've been seeing and biggest splits have been over same-sex marriage and LGBTQ issues following women in church office issues There are a number of splits and denominations including the Christian Reformed Church over women in church office But the LGBTQ splits will probably be bigger and and more painful we've seen that in the Presbyterian Church of the USA we've seen that among the Anglicans right now currently among the Methodists that's happening and And these are really big fights and now again, we're not really usually paying too much attention What is all of this stuff tied to now just a couple of days ago drear wrote I think Rod drear he writes on the Americans conservative He brought up Rene Girard and the Covington Catholic boys and what he notes is he doesn't necessarily draw all of these things together but the long-term connection between this religion that values the least of these and and also Victim and this is this is where this is where Girard comes in and he begins with a quote from Bishop Barron long reader of Girard who met who wrote a piece commenting on the I can I'll leave some of these links in in the comment section commenting on What happened with the Covington boys on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and then he and then drear gets into Girard's book I see Satan falling like lightning I'll skip down a little bit In I see Satan falling like lightning Girard writes about how the concern for victims is what sets Christianity and Judaism apart from all other archaic religions this concern for victims is now being virtually Universalized okay, and and this is where in a sense Sam Harris and Matt de la hunty Although they be atheists yet act like Christians and are receiving the influence of Christianity in them But this is also happening in terms of the woke religion This concern for the victim has now been virtually universalized when they don't make the text bigger here right Even paradoxically as Christianity has begun to decline at least in the West you could say but Girard doesn't at least not here That communism is a godless Absolutizing of concern for the victims see now. I really don't think that's what communism is about Communism is in a sense concerned for the victims based on 19th century Industrialization and Marx ideas of production and his economics But they mostly framed it in terms of class and what we see happening now is more an emotional Imagined emotional victimhood so we're worried about the victimization of chickens and we're worried about the victimization of Sexual minorities and so on and so forth What sets it what sets it apart from Nazism is that Nazism was a massive attempt to redo to refute concern for victims as a basis for society following Nietzsche Nazism condemned Christianity as slave morality Nietzsche's phrase because it taught people how to have compassion for the weak and the unfit. This is very Christian Communism was a pseudo religion that tries to put its Vic to put a victim class on top in a utopian push to write Historic wrongs I would I don't know if Dreher is right here that that's historic Communism that might be as Jordan Peterson calls bloody postmodernism postmodern Neomarxism that would very much be the way Jordan Peterson would categorize it And this very much is I think what we're seeing now Perhaps not what we saw in the early 20th century with the rise of Lenin and Bolshevism in the Soviet Union in a fascinating chapter on Nietzsche Girard credits the philosopher with understanding the Anthropological meaning of Christianity but faults him for rejecting it. This is Girard He opposes so he believes the crowd the crowd mentality But he does not recognize as Dionysian stance as the supreme expression of the mob in its most brutal and most Stupid tendencies now again, you can debate Girard and Nietzsche here I I just having enough conversations with some of you about Nietzsche I can very much imagine that back to back to Girard or Dreher quote quoting Girard Christianity does not yield its ulterior motives for resentment in its concern to rehabilitate victims It is not seduced by contaminated Charity of resentment what it does is to rectify the illusion of myths it exposes the lie of satanic satanic accusation Since Nietzsche is blind to mimetic rivalry a key Girardian concept This is what causes violence and its contagion He doesn't see that the gospel stance towards victims does not come from prejudice in favor of weak against strong But it's heroic resistant to violent contagion and this is this is where Girard gets very interesting Indeed the gospel the Gospels embody the discernment of a small minority that dares to oppose the monstrous mimetic contagion of Dionysian lynching now when it comes to woke religion the Dionysian lynching will come as in a sense post Christian behavior both within woke Christian religionists and woke atheists because what you don't have is a full enough eschatology that will support Christians themselves becoming victims for the sake of victims even to the cost of death and This is a this is a consequence of secularity Now here's where Girard becomes back to dreher here is where Girard becomes especially interesting And relevant to our moment he says that today we hear repeatedly in every way that we no longer have an absolute But in fact the concern for victims is our absolute That is it is the basis of our morality It is the concern for victims that determines what it is what is most important That goes to the top of the hierarchy This is the case because all other sources of absolute value have been lost Why? well The history of the 19th and 20th century the rise and replacement of Christian morality actually the trying to maintain Christian morality without the metaphysical and metaphorical underpinnings back to Girard the current process of spiritual demagoguery and Rhetorical overkill has transformed the concern for victims into a totalitarian command and a permanent Inquisition we are living through Curricaturel ultra Christianity that tries to escape from the Judeo-Christian orbit by Radicalizing the concern of victims in an anti-christian manner in other words they take a goal of Christianity and use a non-christian method of trying to come to terms and realize that goal The intellectuals and the and the other cultural elites elites have promoted Christianity to the role of number one scapegoat Girard says we are at the advent of what he calls the other totalitarianism saying that it is Back to Girard the most cunning and malicious of the two The one with the greatest future by all evidence at present it does not oppose Judeo-Christian Aspirations it is now Girard is writing a little before us but claims them as its own In the church I would say and in the atheist community At present it does not oppose Judeo-Christian aspirations But claims them as its own and questions the concern for victims on the part of Christians Not without certain semblance of reason at the level of concrete action giving the deficiencies of historical Christianity The other totalitarianism does not openly oppose Christianity, but out flanks it on the left wing That's exactly what's been happening in Christian denominations This is the force of what in the Christian tradition is called Antichrist I'm not I'd have a conversation with drear on that. I'm reading drear again You don't have to believe in a literal Antichrist to grasp what Girard is saying here Girard points out that in the symbolic language of the New Testament Antichrist opposes Christ by imitating him and seeking to be better than him. That is correct More more from Girard the Antichrist boasts of bringing to human beings the peace and tolerance that Christianity promises but has failed to deliver Actually what the radicalization of contemporary victim ology produces is a return to all sorts of pagan practices abortion euthanasia sexual undifferentiation Roma circus games galore, but without real victims, etc No horses were harmed in the making of this movie Neo paganism would like to turn the Ten Commandments and all Judeo-Christian morality into some alleged Intolerable violence and indeed its primary objective is to is their complete abolition Faithful observance of the moral law is perceived complicit is perceived complicit Complicity with the forces of persecution that are essentially religious since the Christian denominations have become only Tartally aware of their failings in charity their con Connivance with the established political order Connivance with the established political order in the past and present would have always Sacrificed would world that are always sacrificial They are particularly vulnerable to the ongoing blackmail of contemporary neo paganism neo-paganism locates happiness in the unlimited satisfaction of desires Which means the suppression of all prohibitions? this idea acquires a semblance of credibility in the limited domain of consumer goods who who prodigious Prodigious multiplication thanks to technological progress we can certain mimetic rivalries the weakening of mimetic rivalries confers an appearance of plausibility But only that on the stance that turns the moral law into an instrument of repression and persecution Back to drear and it happens when having cut down all the moral laws to build a brave new world of unlimited satisfaction The money runs out and the economy collapses in his final chapter Girard praises heroism of the scattered disciples in the wake of Jesus resurrection They had no power in fact knew that they had participated in the violent contagion that murdered their master for example Peter's denial What they had was the power of their belief and their ability to communicate Communicate what they had seen and experienced and this ultimately subverted the dominant paradigm of the ancient world which believed that scapegoats were real and necessary and I very much recommend the whole piece by drear So full implicit new atheist adoption of the least of these morality This is a pre this is a woke pre split what this means is that this morality this Christian morality of the least of these and Concerned for what I sometimes call Mental suffering Egalitarianism because it's really it's at that level that this group is focusing This has been adopted by the new atheist as a whole. This is Christian You're not going to find the current least of these morality from the Greeks or the Romans the Romans didn't really care about how their slaves felt and if you want to see reference this look up Tom Holland who is a Historian of the Roman period and I played a little bit of that conversation between NT right and Tom Holland that you can find an unbelievable Christian failure of its own ethos has been a stock element of new atheist anti-christian Anti-theistic assault God is not good And so basically what what new atheists have used against Christians and against Christianity and a grants Christian Apologist is saying basically Your system has not lived up to the implicit imagined eschatology of least of these morality Your system has been bad for women bad for gays bad for slaves And so now we are going to take this at the top of our hierarchy We're going to put the elimination of anguish of least of these people at the top of our hierarchy We're not going to call it religious But that's going to be our guiding star Now you should pay attention especially to a writer like Miroslav Volf in this because Volf came out of the breakdown of Yugoslavia and the the Serbian conflicts and and what he noticed is that the secularism or the Atheism that was present in that system actually made the bloodbaths worse Because you don't wait around for God to rescue you It's up to humanity to save this world and if you let the If you let the your enemies get away with murder now Well, there's no God that will judge them and send them to hell in the future. You've put away all that you've got to get them now and You've got to in order to bring heaven on earth as I've said many times You're gonna bring up hell and that's exactly what comes the time frame is my little short life you know, there's some ties here to to to health and wealth Christianity and and And certain elements in Christian Christianity there you want your best life now and you need it now And so if you have to get it now at the expense of your enemies. Well That's what your moral system calls you to do now these pressures get intensified in Christian settings as well and people will often notice the relationship between secularism and Increasing what I call progressive liberationist Christians in terms of their battles current battles for institutional dominance in Christian denominations Now a little bit later. I'm going to play a little bit from Tim Keller I'm gonna skip this slide for now. I'm just gonna use him as the conclusion Now again this presumed morality which is brought in from Christianity The new atheists have used against Christendom and the new atheists I think we're always a bit naive about the definition of religion and now they are getting schooled in the practice of religion Because at least among Christians Christian the practice of the Christian religion wasn't as Jordan Peterson says reduced to a crippled idea Ideology, which is a crippled religion on one hand Christians Pursued many of their values and back to the 1980s and the rise of the religious right trying to put them into law and That's a whole debate but Christians always had other elements of their faith that At least had the chance to draw them back because on one hand Jesus certainly in the in the sermon on the mount gives Moral prescriptions he also says love your enemies and so there are all these these counterbalancing things going on within Christianity that that often not always often kept people from Falling into full-blown utopianism with Christianity, but now The new the new atheist right the classical liberals still embrace the human nature and so when we talk about Social constructionism this is where Brett Weinstein Sam Harris Jordan Peterson come in and say hey, wait a minute There is an order here and that at least leaves room for what? Catholics and Christians would call natural law or what? Again the term that I've used that some of you have gotten interested in which is natural theology Which is I think exactly what Jordan Peterson is doing but the the new read so so in other words There's a progression here and that makes the the new atheists like Sam Harris and Peter Boghossian and James Lindsay part of the new atheist right and that progression continued on into the woke Religionists and in a sense they came full circle back into a new religion and so ironically what in a sense you have are the Religious and atheists modernists in alignment because they're still looking at for the atheists scientific ideas and for the Christians Textual ideas as their foundation whereas the new foundations are much more Experiential I know this is wrong because I can feel the pain of oppression in my soul and Therefore we as a community we can imagine the painful oppression of these people in my soul So we must now ally to banish the world of that suffering Now if you haven't seen it I'm very much eager for part two It's been a while since part one came out you should definitely watch this video on On the channel of the of the hoax paper perpetrators, and I'll put a I'll put a link in it now I'm gonna jump into a place. Hopefully. I've got it here He hired a friend of his to interview and this is Brett Weinstein and his wife talking about what happened at evergreen and When I watched this video I thought Wow, this is so religious because the ways that the The ways that those who pushed Brett and and his wife out of the college these people sound Just like a lot of church stuff that I've grown up with and seen so let's hear a little bit of it Great many students faculty alumni staff in order to get the lay of the land And so a new president comes into college and he's trying to get the lay of the land and Evergreen being as far left to college as exists in the country was chronically suspicious the faculty were of administrators so anti very egalitarian very nervous about Moritarian and this is very common amongst college. This is very common amongst college faculties and one of the things that's been happening in college faculties over the last 30 years is really this move towards administrative control over faculty control and I've been involved in a lot of conversations with former professors from Calvin College who will give you chapter and verse in this struggle over At Calvin College and in many other institutions, this is a far broader movement That's been happening more and more power away from faculty more and more power to administration right anything administration wanted to do the faculty would if anything they were biased in favor of discussing it more than necessary and not letting anything pass because Basically, it was labor versus management in everybody's mind the job this president who was Okay labor versus management, okay, so, you know left this faculty a little bit Marxist So, you know, hey, we're the workers here Don't alienate us from the from the fruit of our labor really out to do something Had in front of him was how am I can think that? How am I going to convince this very left-leaning faculty? To not only look the other way while I make radical changes to the college But actually embrace my bloat of administration and my tearing down of the evergreen model How can I do that? I can do it by embracing equity. We can do it by embracing equity. Why? Because equity is already at the top of the implicit religious hierarchy We have three major goals for today's forum The first is to continue to learn about the perceptions and experiences of our students faculty and staff of color The second is to create and establish a series of action items And the third is to inspire every member of the evergreen community as we move ahead to advance diversity here on our campus Now again inspire so that sounds very voluntary I'd like to read a list of core tenants developed by a group of anti-racist Racist educators who was who were on a panel at the race and pedagogy conference in Tacoma last year Here are the tenants. Okay. Now we're going to stipulate some of the elements of our religion Racism exists today in both traditional and modern forms Now now what's interesting for me is that when I listen to these tenants and some of you will kvetch at me about this I agree with many of these tenants and I just have Very different ideas about what to do with the reality of racism So I agree that racism racism is present today racism has not been abolished Racism is an institutionalized multi-layered Multi-level system that distributes unequal power and resources between white people and people of color as socially identified And and I can agree with that that this is in fact what happens with racism Now now racism itself is is not terribly easy to define precisely and if you want a lesson in that read Scott Alexander's against murderism and and in fact, even though we bandy about this term racism It's actually pretty difficult to to figure out well what specifically are we talking about? But I wouldn't argue with the fact that racism gets into institutions and can be amplified by institutions That certainly happens all the time too now now remember I'm a Calvinist now some people say you shouldn't call yourself a Calvinist because You're not as deterministic as I think a Calvinist should be well, okay But as a Calvinist one of the things I do believe in this total depravity and that When mr. Reagan did his interview with me, I asked me if I was a racist and I said well, yeah And he's kind of like what do you mean? You're a racist? I think I've got racism in my heart racism is part of the package of of Sin that all of us have in our human nature and what I mean by that is we are all grown with biases But I'm not saying that only white people have racism I'm saying all people have racism You can't help but have biases and those biases are going to play out and given where we are in history Some of those biases will be racial but that is true of white people of black people of brown people of People from every continent and language. It's just a part of growing up in this world You will have biases and because so many biases get tagged to to racial Elements those are gonna be all over the place. No argument with that and disproportionately benefits whites and If you're if your group is in power Well, it's you're probably gonna benefit your group All members of society are so socialized to participate in the system of racism. I'll be it within varied social locations That sounds reasonable All white people benefit from racism regardless of intentions. That's a little broad because And again, that's that's complicated but there's a lot of truth to it No one chose to be socialized into racism. So no one is quote-unquote bad, but no one is neutral Not act against racism is to support racism That statement is just waiting for a theologian to jump in and say bad good. What are these categories? Shall we talk about them? Racism must be continually identified analyzed and challenged. No one is ever done Okay, but here's here's something that a a knowledge and experience within religious communities could offer It's that All going all the way back to Augustine and way before there's something about forbidden fruit if you keep putting energy into it You might in fact Make things worse That sin is not something that is simply managed by us Consciously it's very different from that and in fact some of the worst sins we do attempts to undo other sins in that You're not just going to deal with racism from a frontal assault that quite frankly is very naive about human beings The question is not did racism take place but rather how did racism manifest in that situation? Okay. Now you're mapping this onto every situation and right here we're gonna begin to get into what is the problem with this whole thing is that Basically, you've constructed a rather facile simplistic hierarchy and said well equity is at the top and we're defining equity as racism. It's like Okay, but you're the Intersectionality people whatever happened to sexism whatever happened to class whatever happened to bias towards tall people I've enjoyed enjoyed tall privilege all my life Well that all my life at least as long as since I've been tall and I know that cuz it's kind of late bloomer And I wasn't very tall in high school later on in college. I became tall and it's like hey It's better to be tall than short unless you're flying in an airplane Then there's short privilege and I I sit there in misery in an airplane watching all these people with short privilege Enjoy being able to move their legs and I think ah what it wouldn't be to be short But once I get out into the terminal and I'm taller than everyone and can enjoy that privilege Well, then it goes and see this is the this is why you in fact should think about hierarchies and pay attention to how they work Because if you just say well here it is at the top of the hierarchy and we're going to orient ourselves With respect to this well and Jordan Peterson has done an excellent job of articulating this you are in fact Not going to be able to achieve your goals because the world is way more complex than this The racial status quo is comfortable for most whites therefore anything that maintains white comfort is suspect oh Oh so now see and this is where things get really interesting because We're going to try and make things more comfortable for people who have been just traditionally Discriminated against at the expense of the comfort for people who have traditionally benefited from discrimination Okay, but again You're going to begin well, okay this so there you have race. Well, what about gender? Well, what about? What about all these other categories pretty soon? You're what you're actually going to do is pathologize comfort and This is where we get into the strange persistent of guilt that the moment you start to feel comfortable Well, there must be something wrong and again if you've got a lot of experience in religious communities you know all about this if In many religious communities this is an ongoing issue that you're feeling comfortable I must be doing something wrong. I must be taking advantage of someone. I must be sitting because this feels good You know those impulses in religious communities and as you live with them and as you continue to process them You begin to create a far more nuanced understanding of Well good and evil right and wrong morality shalom health all of these things which are in fact very much at play in the hierarchy but you've completely eliminated that and just put one thing on top and Now you're all gonna feel good about feeling guilty. Okay. Well turn the screw once more You're feeling good about feeling guilty. That must be revealing something wrong So now you should even feel guilty about feeling good about feeling guilty, but now you're feeling guilty So you're feeling good about that. It's an endless cycle. And if you don't believe me Well, you should because I've watched Calvinists and other Christians Work through these issues and play these games and suffer for them sometimes for generations. This is read Christian pious History and you'll find these conversations all over the place There is nothing new under the Sun and this is now you're all imagining This is all brand new and you're making this up and you're inventing it and for the first time now here at the imagined climax of history we now will suddenly arrive at the Golden Age Now ain't gonna happen The racially oppressed have a more intimate insight via experiential knowledge of the system of race and than their racial impressors That's absolutely true the folks on the bottom of an arrangement always know the people on top of them better than the other way around I don't know what it's like to be short Unless I remember about when I was short The short person on the airplane doesn't know how I suffer and I'm sitting there and that and that seat in the back of the airplane and this short person in front of me puts their seat back and and Bangs into my legs and then they start banging the seat. Why doesn't this seat go back further? It's cuz my legs are here. Well your legs shouldn't be there It's like well, why don't you get in? Why don't you get? Why don't you get in touch with your short privilege and understand my tall misery? But then once we get out to the gate and I can see over the whole crowd and find my airplane and they're trying to look Up at everyone. Well, why don't you get involved with your tall privilege? Instead of flaunting it over me and walking right past me with your with your long legs and running faster than I can through The airport with your large body and moving me out of the way when there's a line There's all kinds of privilege but do black people know a lot more about racism against them than most white people of course but change matters It'll be different However, white professors will be seen as having more legitimacy thus positionality must be intentionally engaged Unless in fact you begin to change this and now you say well these white professors will have less legitimacy because they're white So now suddenly we're going to fawn on black professors Now you've just given them privilege now. You've just set up the same dynamic that you said was problematic So again coming from a religious point of view There's no end to these systems and I'm not saying they're illegitimate I am saying they're not as simply addressed as you might imagine and If you get real tyrannical about addressing them, you'll just be setting up more suffering Which was ironically the thing that you said you wanted to eliminate. Oh but these certain people can suffer and these certain people will suffer and These people will not suffer at the expense of these people well now you're bringing up how to try and Grasp at your heaven Resistance is a predictable reaction to anti-racist education and must be explicitly and strategically addressed Addressed and this is all this therapeutic language and but again This this one should this one should make you stop and say anyone who disagrees with me Is what evil unwoke? Again, um as Many of the atheists are pointing out religious people have been playing these games for a long time. You've just switched terms But it's the same game and as a religious person I'll say yeah, and you know what it doesn't work well in the church because we play this game a lot It doesn't help people in the church. It doesn't help towards your imagined goal of bringing new people in the church It's a bad game Now you're gonna take it on it's not gonna be good I Believe these core tenets can be a guide for our work moving forward with actions to educate ourselves and our students And if you read the Apostle Paul, he would say there's a funny thing that happens with law You can have the best laws in the world and what our human hearts can do with them is Create sin with them. So so in other words within Christianity There's even a critique of law in other words once you set up Let's say ten commandments. Well, you've now privileged those who for whatever reason are more able to keep them and Allow these people to rise in the community often with self-righteousness Which is critically dangerous again all of these people are Critically dangerous again all of this stuff has been worked on in religious communities for a very long time and now Now suddenly who we have these rules we can we can make the world better Yeah, read the Old Testament did did the Covenant make Israel better? some ways Did it also condemn them? Yeah, read the Apostle Paul same issues. This stuff isn't new We galvanize white privilege in the form of current curriculum exalting white canons of fine art literature theory and scientific thinking more so We don't examine how those cannons are made so You're gonna get rid of all the old books Get rid of all the old books you're only gonna have books written after a certain date by certain professors again Look at Christian schools who only read safe books by safe Christians and look how look how Look how peculiar? Christians can get well, we're only gonna read Calvinist authors we're not gonna read our minion authors and we're only going to read Christians after the Reformation We're not gonna read those church fathers We're only gonna read the New Testament and then the Reformation and then whatever whatever Pastor we think has it right now We've been playing these games in Christian churches for a very long time and I'll tell you it doesn't go good but okay, I Believe we are capable of unlearning the habits of mind that perpetuate white privilege and you don't see the Contradiction in everything you've just said before this one What I am uncertain of is our collective will to examine those habits oh Now we're Arminian now. This is all about the will and so what you really need to save yourself is to really screw down hard on that will and By social pressure get people to comply again Christians have been working with this stuff for a very long time This I believe I believe ever Now we're having stand up. This is this is testimony time This is this is church ring can create a more vibrant community of anti-racist Activists on our staff and faculty and among our students if we break our 45 year Pattern of occasionally turning toward these issues briefly with deep but short-run commitment that fades fades and fades This is liturgical Our words of action disappearing into the background as we return to business as usual Breaking this cycle will take sustained and stubborn leadership from our Administration and at least a doubling of our staff and faculty of color this I do believe I believe deeply in the critical and audacious goal of eliminating racism and violence in our world I Believe we're all privileged to engage in that work in a learning community that wants to be better It's so funny is it supposedly white folks doing this and but what amazes me is that? and I believe we have the will to do so Thank you for coming today See part of what this does is make all of us keep looking at race in a certain way This is putting more energy into the racial system and and what you're going to wind up doing is in fact Promoting racism in the name of eliminating it which I think is exactly what we're seeing I There's all the applause there was a faculty meeting with an unusual agenda the agenda involved the faculty voting to Require our union to insert into our contract a provision in which every faculty member Would reflect on their own growth relative to their personal racism each and every year in their self-evaluation Again In a Christian college Or in a church we would want the faculty or the clergy to every year Reflect on are they growing in Christ? We've been around this kind of stuff a long time and we know well Let's ask them to reflect on it and then let's have them report it. Maybe let's score them You know Jamie got a score of eight in pursuing Jesus this year and Jennifer only got a six and it's like Christians for a long time have known this game doesn't work now now again pay attention We don't just have one idea Equity on the top of our hierarchy We've got a person Jesus who we want to live up to but built within that person is a whole is Is a complexity that you cannot arrive at by naming one aspect And that is a critical difference and I'm going to talk about some of the other differences later to me a lot of this goes into Is well, I think John McWhorter has had and said some of the best stuff about this So I want to I want to pull up that video, but I didn't cue it up here. So Okay, I'm gonna play some of my favorite video with with Glenn Lowry and John McWhorter talking about race change and I don't want to make it seem like I'm talking around the fact that as Glenn was referring to The idea that freshmen are now given Ta-Nehisi Coates his book to read To me basically just stops the race debate in its tracks if it's gonna be like that Then I'm not in it until some time passes. This is what I mean There are two problems. One is a white problem. One is a black problem. I'm gonna do the white one first it has become a matter of religious faith among educated white people in America to Feel a sense of atonement for being racist when I say that it's religious I don't mean that as Kind of trash talk. I don't mean that as a way of getting attention I mean that it has become a matter of what any Anthropologists who had no pre-existent biases would identify as a religious faith We don't use the word religion But it is a faith and that is the idea that for example, I'm gonna use a phrase that we're also used to but really break It down America needs to come to terms with racism. Okay What terms? What does that mean come to terms? What would the situation be if America came to those terms? Let's imagine the America that we're all about to walk back into after this seminar This is an America where America has come to terms what is it about something that would be written is it about Conversations that would be had what are the terms one imagines a certain musical soundtrack, but that's that's a movie What are the terms it has no meaning at all that America would come to terms does it mean? Reparations for slavery because we've talked about that and nothing comes of it and yet we keep talking about the coming to terms It means nothing what it means is that Educated whites now consider it a mark of being morally advanced to acknowledge their inner racists and the idea is that at some point America will come to terms with that racism, but what are the terms that has no meaning except as an analogy to Christian Theological conceptions. It's about a judgment day It's about this time when all of a sudden something happens where white people are absolved of their inner racism and then we move on but Obviously in terms of the lives that we're leading walking around with our bottles of water that has no meaning at all And so that's not activism To be a white person and to think I am racist. I have white privilege I'm going to acknowledge this all the time does nothing for the black people that Glenn was just talking about It's something that's inwardly directed. It's very humane. It's well intended But it has nothing to do with anything that dr. King was talking about it has nothing to do with anything that the civil rights Movement was about it's an inwardly turned and frankly idle matter I Have not written about this because I think it would be mean to the people who convene Aspen But I'll say it here that I was at Aspen in 2017 and Various things were discussed at Aspen. It was a very smart event Brilliance was going on at Aspen But of course at one point in the middle there was this event that was about racism in the 20th 21st century Okay, so racism in the 21st century now the question would be given all the other events What were we going to learn at this event? What was the new thing? But there was nothing to learn. I went to this thinking to myself I shouldn't go but I'm black and I'm at Aspen and there aren't that many black people I should go and I'm gonna learn about you know, the racism here at Aspen So I went the food was spectacular now It was run by one of my favorite black commentators I'm not gonna name who she was but I really wish they had not wasted her time doing this and there were three panelists and Everybody who was black at Aspen went to it and a lot of the white people as well This event had no substance whatsoever. It was church. It was literally church No one would have used the word church, but there was this church service in the middle of Aspen So an eminent black foundation director who I will not name Talked about how when he was coming up in the business He would not wear casual clothes on casual Friday where he worked Because he thought that it wouldn't be good for a black person to do that and everybody clapped That was considered very funny Then a middle-aged I know I'm middle-aged too a middle-aged white man talked about how he has a coach To teach him about white privilege every week Somebody comes to his house every week and teaches him that he's privileged as a white person and everybody clapped in other words He has a pastor and then everybody left and everybody talked about how wonderful this event had been nobody learned anything That event served for white people at Aspen to atone for being racist and everybody went off and actually learned things It was a church service That is the way things are now every third story on slate is a church service every third story at NPR is a church service It really doesn't help anything To acknowledge that racism is something more Abstract than cross burnings on lawns is one thing to walk around thinking of it as a permanent stain that you must always Atone for and never really will until America quote-unquote comes to terms with racism is fiction It is something as benighted and idle as something that we might see in an unlettered tribe and find curious That is the white problem and then he goes on to the black problem, but I'll leave a link to that watch the whole video. It's a it's a great video Now how does this work? Well equity is at the top of their hierarchy and they somehow have equated equity with racism, but you can dare bet that that Association can change Probably instantly depending on see now Heather Heather hiring hiring Brett Weinstein's wife You know, she basically saw this as a strategic move for the president to undo What they wanted I'm very not familiar. I don't doubt what she has to say I'm not gonna weigh in on that but but here's the thing once you put something at the top of the hierarchy there that you put there You can also take it out. You can also move it This is not going to create a stable community partly because equity is so amorphous and Can be associated with so many different things and there are near infinite Aspects to associate with it. Well, it can go in any direction But so your top value will not only govern it will limit your top value will bring all Bring all other values into alignment Around it and I was gonna in previous iterations of this video I was gonna spend some time talking about bounded set and center set but I don't have time I'd like to talk about that and another video Now now Brett Weinstein is actually very much on to this and in a very interesting in a very interesting Podcast with Dax Shepard. He talked about this and what he says here is is very much correct We are often juggling Actually, this is this is Dax talking to three ideals We're actively trying to service three ideals that are often contradictory So even in our Constitution we have equality and we have liberty and these things are often mutually exclusive And yet we value both and what we fail to recognize is at best we will have the pendulum somewhere we The majority agrees with we will never have all liberty and we will never have all equality And so just starting the the conversation with look we're all gonna have to give a bit We both want both these things to be thriving yet. We know they can't both be thriving and For people people are so drawn to decisiveness This is one of the things people loved about Donald Trump is things were quite black and white for him and in And there's comfort in that decisiveness There's a lot of unease in some weird compromises at 60% equality 40% liberty That's uncomfortable for us, but I think we're gonna have to learn to explore that more and and think of that as a Zone we're gonna live in is that am I making any sense? Oh, yeah This is actually One of my favorite points because I think there's actually something very hopeful at the end of it Which is if you get to the stage of having an adult conversation Which we're having trouble with in public, but privately it's possible where you do say hey, you know what? It's not that liberty and Equality cannot both thrive. They actually can what you can't do is maximize either one Right anytime you try to maximize a single parameter every other value you have will crash as a result So anybody who's got a one parameter objective can't be allowed near the levers of power Which is exactly what happened at his former employer So I think I think they make an excellent thing But now pay attention that liberty and equality are both these abstract terms and they're at play Liberty and equality are both these abstract terms and they're at play in a world with multiple multiple variables Now why this is still a Christian civil Christendom civil war Christianity developed a delivered a devastating egalitarian payload into world culture and Luke Introduction to philosophy they should pull it up But the one of the thing one of the ways that Christianity changed World culture and Tom Holland sees this and NT right as they talked about what happened with the Apostle Paul is the implicit It's implicit in Genesis and the Imago Dei and it gets radically pursued by Jesus So the least of these this value the least of these gets put into the mix now And and Rod Rear says well that then kind of gets disconnected from Christianity and gets put up to the top of the hierarchy But and he says well that was communism that communism was kind of playing some other games But the same thing that happened with communism will happen with this same with this same pursuit because of The way human beings are so so Jesus radically pursued the least of these But he also practiced the greatest is the servant of all and He did so at the expense of his own life And he did so at the expense of his own life with again the promised resurrection Which continues to change this iron box of secularism yet Christianity also never gives up on hierarchy so you have the father and the son and the Holy Spirit the Trinity at the top of the hierarchy and Listen to the Jonathan Peugeot's channel hierarchies Automatically form and and so what Christianity does is is there are hierarchies and their equalities and they live in tension with each other And that is in a sense this liberty equality tension But it's it's even more diverse and broader and vaster than that Because here what happens to Christianity is you often have the inversion of the hierarchy and Jesus says that the greatest of you The greatest among you will be the servant of all so we invert the hierarchy the Son of God becomes the scapegoat and all the sins of the world are placed on him and He is he also then becomes the sacrificial lamb Christianity is always playing with these concepts, but it does so in a long rich historical conversation that the church never gets fully right and and we've just had hundreds we've had decades of getting it wrong and Compensating and getting it wrong and compensating Getting it wrong and compensating now suddenly We imagine let's just throw everything old out the window because of patriarchy and racism And we're just gonna get it right the first shot by putting equality at the equity at the top of the hierarchy Ain't gonna happen it is just not going to happen and the reason I say it won't happen is because many have tried and If you want to read some history you can see the innumerable yet predictable ways that it always falls apart because Every instantiation has to have a person at the top and that person is continually vulnerable to All the things that normally flawed people are vulnerable is it racism is it sexism is it is it is it? Is it greed is it avarice? Which of is it pride is it desire for control? You know you always have a person at the top of the hierarchy and that person will always be fallible Now if you go back to the Jordan Peterson biblical lectures, and I didn't take the time to Find that clip and pull it up But one of the things that he notes is that what happened in Christianity in the early period is that they? Resisted the ancient Near East and then Eastern practice that went all the way to Rome of divinizing the Emperor's See it makes sense in a system like that to say well Pharaoh or Emperor is divine you put him at the top of the hierarchy, but Christianity doesn't do that why? Christianity preserve the instantiation of the top of the hierarchy offshore Above the iron box of secularism. Why is that important because the king? is always subject and accountable to God God alone who is incorruptible God alone is at the top and God is able to manage many complex Ideals and if you have a God at the top you resist what we call idolatry what has I got idolatry? Idolatry is taking a good thing or even a good idea and making it an ultimate ideal The problem is let's say you make equity your ultimate ideal well now suddenly liberty or or other expressions of shalom are going to suffer because of it and in fact Having a person at the top rather than simply an ideal means that there is in fact more flexibility that can account for unpredictable and innumerable complex Context that will come unto the scene Okay, and so that's why and Peterson points this out in the biblical series. That's why in Christianity The king is never at the top now this gets played out even in our own system in democracies in Western democracies We have this saying no one is above the law you place the law Above the ruler and in a sense what you do is you divinize a constitutional process the weakness of that as we always see is that constitutional processes are Susceptible to corruption and manipulation, and that's why again in the Christian system God is above it all and God exacts judgments on those underneath who Violate his law violate shalom sin or miss the mark that's why a Secular system is Always vulnerable to that which is common to all of us so if you imagine if you can only imagine religion is overt and not in fact the expression of of those highest axioms within your own system or the highest axioms that are actually built into the fully layered What I would call as a Christian created order If you imagine religion is overt Connections to is only overt connections to ancient mythos you fail to realize what religion is and you or your rivals Religious behaviors will surprise you and that's exactly what's happening well, oh I'll get under two hours and I'll get home for dinner So I'm at the end and this could have been a whole lot longer I've been really struggling to get this video out because there's so much I would love to talk about with respect of this But I thought a good way to conclude it was this part from Tim Keller's lecture at Princeton Theological Seminary now those of you many of you might not know what surrounded this Tim Keller was offered the Kuiper Prize at Princeton Seminary now There's a lot of politics in this but but that was That announcement was not well received you remember earlier in the video I talked about old Princeton and how old Princeton basically the the modernists won That fight and the conservatives all left the institution years later a Big donor came along and wanted to offer a Kuiper Prize Kuiper after Abraham Kuiper of the Netherlands now There's a little bit of tension in that because Abraham Kuiper's rise came as a response to Christian modernism and Kuiper then became a conservative and even became Prime Minister of the Netherlands He was a newspaper editor. He was quite a polymath. Well the Scholarship committee gave decided to give the Kuiper Prize to Tim Keller Well, who was Tim Keller Tim Keller's a minister in the Presbyterian Church of America. Well Presbyterian Church of America does not ordain women to ecclesiastical Ecclesiastical offices office it is in that respect more conservative than the Christian Reformed Church where I serve Tim Keller also is not affirming of LGBT issues and so what happened at Princeton was that there was an uproar amongst the student body and they clamored and yelled at the administration to Unaward Tim Keller the prize there was eventually a negotiation and Tim Keller was allowed to give a speech Because he had prepared it and I thought he gave a terrific speech and you can find it answering Leslie Newbegin a whole nother scholar Actually, I rewatched this this morning because of a email that I got from someone I referred to this video a number of months ago, but listening to it this morning. I thought Tim Keller really articulates how Christianity breaks the assumptions of the polarizations that we in our contexts get locked into by speaking from outside of them and having been developed over hundreds of years and many many test cases of frankly failure to our own ideals and Obviously speaking in a Christian manner betrayal of our Lord and the whole speech is great But I'll just play a little part of it that I think is germane to this context A unique category disrupting social project the fourth thing is a unique category disrupting social project That's what he says Christianity offers a unique category disrupting social project that actually disrupts just about everything because again, we're sinful human beings and we always corrupt our own projects that we set up to align them with Whatever we want now anybody knows Newbegin knows one of his most famous and influential state ideas Is that is that the community in fact the congregation is the hermeneutic of the gospel? That now what that means is that You can have an ideal you can put words on pages But actually that which interprets and expresses and bears witness to the gospel is this flawed human community that again speaking as a Christian pastor by the power of the Holy Spirit always imperfectly expresses and bears witness to Jesus in a contemporary context at a local zip code that you embody the gospel In your community and in a sense that proclaims the gospel more powerfully than your words or put it this way your words Will not in any way hit home unless backed up by a community that embodies the words So that's all great, right? Yeah, okay. Okay. Well, what does that community look like and let me just suggest we read Newbegin on this alongside of a guy named Larry Hurtado of Edinburgh University in America is now the adjustment scholar has recently written a book called Destroyer of the gods looking at the first early Christian Church The early Christian Church and how they had a missionary encounter With their culture and a big part of their missionary encounter was the fact that they he calls it a social project He had a particular kind of community that Broke through the categories it was they were offensive and attractive But here are the five things the five things that that early Christian Church was marked by number one It was far more multi-ethnic and multiracial than any religions look religious community anybody ever seen number two It was more generous for the poor More committed to the poor the marginalized than they'd ever seen You know the Emperor Julian had this famous statement saying the trouble with this Christians reason why they're growing is they don't take care of Just their own poor but ours as well Number three are marked by non retaliation and forgiveness Now words if you went and you burned down a Christian's house and you beat them up and you killed them They never got together and went to your house and burned your house down and killed you never Number four I'll say this carefully and explain they're positively against abortion and infant exposure Now the reason I use were it as you know abortion existed, but it wasn't very safe it was much more common what you did with an unwanted child was you infant exposure you put them out of the garbage and They either died there or somebody took them and and and made them slaves Christians were positive big and said they didn't just forbid their women To do that they went out and brought the kids in and took care of them and raised them So in other words they were committed to the problem and the whole problem. They didn't just prohibit it and number five They were sexual counterculture that is to say they were far stricter in the area sexual ethics far stricter than the rung of the world around them and Both Larry Hurtado and Kyle Harper in his book from shame to sin say that it was weird is that the Christian rules of Sexual conduct looks so incredibly strict the underlying logic They said the underlying vision of sexuality was actually considerably higher and more And more attractive and as a result over the years over the centuries that logic won out now Here's what I want to say to show you what I'm saying pretty quickly Two of those five things look like Democrats Two of them are racial and economic justice Two of those five sound Republican and conservative Right the the prohibition of abortion infant exposure and the traditional sex ethics So two of them look like liberal Democrat two of them look like Republican and one of them dare I say it Picasso The one on non retaliation and forgiveness that doesn't look like any Here's the point Most Christians I know would like to drop two of those The two that are you know, they don't fit in with the party they belong But do you not see That one of the greatest ways to explain that the gospel is not the product of a particular culture But actually comes from God is that the community that creates would actually break through the categories Is do we have communities like that? Many Now notice He says the communities That we that we imagine from the New Testament Church would break through the categories break through the the Polarization that we have here. Do we have those communities? Not many notice what he doesn't do. Okay we're gonna be that community now and Don't work that way We certainly want to practice justice But we're also going to believe in Liberty well, well then we're never gonna get there Well, that's probably true on every account. We're not never but not in the age of decay but this is what we're striving for and we're not going to kill you if you fail it and And yet we're going to hold each other accountable and strive for it out of fear Out of fear because the administration is gonna come down on us No, there will be accountability and and but it's it's a kind of voluntary accountability like if I say, you know I'd really like to lose weight and I'd like you to hold me accountable and ask me if I'm still having that dish of ice cream every night when you know when I Probably should just be having another glass of water Well, do I like it if you ask me about if I had that dish of ice cream no because I want to eat that dish of ice cream, but I'm complex in that and There's something I want and so it's voluntary so so as you can see Religion isn't a bad thing but what you're going to have to do is figure out what can you learn from it and How can you arrive at it? How can we in fact do you want to be racist? No Understand that racism is far more complex than just saying I won't be racist anymore It's just and again in churches we've dealt with this It's like sin is far more complex than I'm not going to sin anymore. Oh, yes, you are Well, well now you're just being dismissive of it. No, no, I'm not I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna see that in fact so often when I try not to sin in certain ways I wind up sinning in other ways and Now I might just be thinking about one or two things and now we've got an entire community So how does a community approach this? Not in the way ever going evergreen is now I'm told that their student enrollment is way down Because here's the thing Nobody really likes living under a tyranny whether it's a tyranny associated with an ancient religious Mythos or if it's a tyranny associated with a contemporary idealistic utopian aggressive ethos Nobody wants to live that way. Well, why well at the same time? We don't want to live in disorder. And so now we're working that order chaos thing again, so I Don't know if this video is any good. It's taken me a few hours to do it I've been unable to get a lot of videos out. I hope there was something helpful in here I hope it was worth your time And again, I'm still wrestling with this to try and get my ideas succinct because I I just have so many ideas about this because when I watch These new religions arise and and sometimes within the church. I think You're forgetting everything you're forgetting a lot of what we've learned over the years and actually when it arises in the church There are actually resources that you can call people to and say now how wait a minute You're also committed to this over here and that's gonna balance this so so certainly there is a history of racism certainly there is a history of bias certainly we have messed things up, but Your theology that says well if we only make these institutional and structural changes Or if we only adopt this language then somehow we can get rid of these things Not if you've been paying attention to any kind of religious history It's far more complex than that so again. I hope this was helpful Now we're 45 minutes not the longest I've ever done But really wanted to get something out just besides the interviews and thanks again for all of you who have agreed to Let me post your interviews. I know for many of you. It's a little bit hard Should I let them post it should I not and and I know that there is risk but in many ways In many of these conversations, I think there are things that Others can benefit from and I think we see that in the comment section and for the most part I think people have been well behaved in the comment section, and I'm really pleased by that so thanks for watching
