 Hi, this is Paul. This is sort of a words that fudge video and it's a video about the resurrection because I want to talk about the word Reality and I'm gonna pull together just a bunch of stuff that I've continued to be thinking about as I Process all the Jordan Peterson stuff and all the John Verveke stuff And I'm just so appreciative to both these men for putting out what they put out and sharing and just keeping the wheels turning and keeping thoughts going on in my head Now this this word reality where does it come from? Well? Property possession that's interesting real estate you might notice that connection anyway definitions are something about you know the state of being Actual and actuals funny because actual is is right here right now or real home Reality using real to define reality that doesn't seem quite right the reality of an event The ultimate reality of life the world or the state of things as they actually exist again. That's a very now actually As opposed to idealistically or notionally one of the more interesting Notions here is one of the most interesting definitions here is number five Obsolete loyalty devotion Thomas Fuller to express our Realty to the Emperor that's a very interesting definition synonyms truth Actuality you can see even just from the definition of this world word We we have a hard time pinning this thing down and as opposed to fantasy Which of course leads to our the struggle that we have with the idea of myth now now one of the one of the my go-to Quotes from Peterson is what he said shared with Roger Scrutin in terms of just a real brief Just basically again again again he says you know the world is too big we can't we can't capture the whole world So what we do is we capture these low resolution Impressions and memories and and they're not always pictures or thing or of objects In this this referential sense of it that we often use in terms of truth and in the video I did of Talking about the Bogosian podcast. I went through some of the verveky Interview where he talked about this family of knowledge. There's propositional truth. There's techne or procedural Knowledge there's perspectival knowledge there's Participatory knowledge and there's there's probably more but this this little quote from Peterson I use quite often I think I think is very helpful Well, I think it's useful as an adjunct to that so so Sir Roger mentioned that The transcendent is what we bump up against when we realize our ignorance And so it's that which transcends our ignorance and and that in itself makes it an Implacable fact unless you believe that you have no ignorance in which case there's no point in Furthering a discussion with you So the transcendent is the fact in so far as it's that which transcends our ignorance But you can also think about it technically so and and and I think we know enough about how the brain works now So that not that we know much so that useful things can be said about that you tend to represent the world in the Simplest manner that you possibly can that works for what you're doing and so you don't actually see the world you see sufficiently useful low represent low resolution representations of the world and If they work then that's fine There's no need to adjust them and they're relatively easy to remember and to manipulate but now and then you have a Misapprehension about someone let's say and you have a conversation with them and the conversation goes sideways And what that means is that? The the thing that you thought you were conversing with is not the thing that you're conversing with and that manifests itself in error right, so error is the place where the transcendent reveals itself and What is actually revealing itself is the reality that's? Outside and underneath your perceptions and so what you see in the world in some sense is a set of animated cartoons And a lot of that is actually a consequence of you seeing nothing But your memory because your brain is organized so that instead of going through all of the difficulty of having to look at the thing In it in itself you look at what you assume to be there And if you can get away with that so much the better But the thing in itself is always much richer richer than your apprehension of it Which is partly why you make mistakes, but also partly why you can continue to garner wisdom in the world there's always more there than meets the eye and God only knows how much more there's there that meets the eye and You can show this even in the religious sense to some degree Okay, many goes on from there That's quite a bit and so you have this you have this idea that my little I'm in the way of my little illustration So so maybe I put myself over here there we go So so we have this we have this idea of you know we see this world And it's out there, and it's rich and it's full and of course even even a tiny little scene like this where the the dog is is trying to get the cat out of his bed and You know the dog eventually wins and I explained to my children that you know if the dog starts to lose these battles the dogs in real trouble because he can only see out of one eye and you know the only thing going for him is his mouth is bigger than the cat and in the cat's mouth and he can never catch the cat because the cats way faster and more agile and But but the dogs the dogs got it the dogs got to keep going but anyway So so we take this huge world and we we select and this is where you get the salience We select that which is important and that which is important because of our desire that which is important because of our need That you know we have opportunities and threats you have all of this stuff going on and we compress it compress it down into these tiny low-resolution You know drawings or movies there They're actually very tiny and they're and they're in our heads, but they're not even just pictures of objects out there They're impressions and smells and memories I mean all of this stuff going on but it's all gets it all has to get Incredibly compressed and condensed so that it can fit in our head in a in a movable way And I love the way Peterson talks about how this is you know this is useful for us And this is this is how it has to work now Here's my little probably two-year-old self somewhere at the beach getting a Sunburn that will give me skin cancer someday because we didn't know about that but here I am at the Jersey Shore sleeping away and One of my parents thought this was cute, so took a picture of me We all have this experience of dreaming and and dreams seem real So we're gonna talk about this word this word reality dreams seem real and sometimes when you're dreaming you kind of figure out No, no, this is dreaming and then sometimes you have inception like dreaming Sometimes if I wake up early in the morning, and I don't want to bother my wife I'll put in a podcast And I'll just put in a podcast and put headphones on and lay in bed And then sometimes I'll fall back asleep, and then I'll have the experience of sleeping And I'm hearing you know whoever's on the you know Jordan Peterson or John Verveke or Tim Keller or someone just talking And it's like why are they why is why is this? Why is this voice happening and then sometimes like inception that he'll it'll the voice will colonize my dream And then at some point they'll say oh I've got to stop this and so then I I Try and turn it off on my phone in the dream And it still doesn't turn off and I just have to come up far enough to realize no wait a minute I'm actually in bed, and this is in my ears So then I'll reach down and turn it off or I'll wake up or something like that and so it's funny how we have these levels of reality and these layers of reality and I was talking to my friend James who comes to the who comes to the who comes to the meetups and James is a he's a he's got a PhD and and In neuropsychology and he you know he's talking about you know are we are we always dreaming during the day I mean this is this kind of gets into Peterson's point that Our mind is always putting up these images, but while we're awake and engaged in the world There's this there's this this much broader connected image of the world outside of ourselves Which is not subject to our control and somehow these two worlds meet And this is the this is actually as we'll get into a little bit later This is what Don Hoffman calls the interface that we are actually connecting with And and so we see things that we want to see and we don't see things that aren't relevant to us And I mean all this vast Complexity going on all the time and this experience of what we're witnessing. This is reality Okay, and if you're a long time ago I I referenced the heretic which was in the weekly standard an article about Thomas Nagel this and it talked about this manifest image and I often had that portrayed to me quite vividly when I had a good friend of mine who Was spending a lot of time around the church But he had very low sight and he explained to me that he really kind of looked out through a tube And that's all he could see and some and he also was was losing his hearing and so I'd walk up to him next time I'd walk up to him Sometimes I'd be standing right next to him and he didn't know I was there and suddenly I would say something or do something I'm like bow I popped into his world like like Barbara Eden and I dream of Jeannie and he'd pull a start back And you know, he'd be like don't scare me like that. You know, sorry Brandon So, you know this weird Relationship with reality that we have Now what's interesting about the dream world sometimes you get a vivid dreaming where you can kind of impose your will on the dream world It's sort of like Neo and the matrix, you know make things unfold and happen like you want them to But this layer of reality this dream world gets pierced and threatened by the alarm clock or the dog Or a kid crying or the podcast and it's so interesting how one level Colonizes the other and so the alarm clock is more real than my dream in a certain sense It isn't that the dream isn't real just that the alarm clock is more real Well, how how does the physical world and the dream world relate? I talked about that a little bit before and maybe one of these days I'll I'll have my friend James come on and he'll do his little shtick about the fact that we don't really dream and it gets Into this question that you know, right already I'm Even though my mind imagines I'm seeing everything out here in my messy office The truth is I'm not I My my eyes aren't even physically seeing it My brain is sort of filling in the gaps and that's the same reason and you learn this when you're a grade school kid You know cover one eye and there is a blind spot and you can you know play little tricks to find your blind spot But your your brain just fills it in and creates this Creates this image for us and of course only a little portion of our eye really has that high resolution And it's our eyes are actually always moving and it's darting around and if I want to focus on something, you know There I do I can focus right on it But the rest of my eyes considerably low resolution because my brain can only handle so much, you know this much we know So is the dream world dependent on the physical world? Now this of course is the is the great debate This is the question of consciousness and this is the hard problem of consciousness, but we do know that they are certainly connected Okay So so whether we're going to use the radio image that our brains are sort of like Cellphones or radios and they're picking up they're picking up Transmissions or whether it's all generated from our head whether Consciousness is far more common than I would know. I remember in the Jordan Peterson Sam Harris Conversations, you know Sam Harris was postulating about computers and consciousness. Well, how would you know your PC isn't conscious? You know and this gets into Brett Weinstein's idea of a programmed robot Well, you know if my if my PC starts talking back to me Well, it does talk back to me talks back to me all the time and I can talk to Siri or Cortana Or I don't know why Google doesn't give itself some some cool name I have to say I don't want to say it because then my phone and my computer are gonna talk to me but you know on and on and on so What's the relationship between what is consciousness? Where does it come from? We can't really answer that question, but we know that Consciousness is real and there's something important about the physical world that that we don't want to lose However, and then we all instinctively know this We maintain this I'm gonna get to this slide a little bit later but we maintain this bias for the real world if if Your son or your daughter is spending all of their time looking at screens or on the internet or engaging in a virtual world Parents have problems. Well, Peter someone was about ready in that clip to talk about psychedelics If you could just put yourself on a on a perpetual psychedelic trip and lay in bed You know think about Soma and brave new world lay in bed for the rest of your life Do you think that would be a good thing or do we have a bias about? The physical world that that somehow this is important and and Something that we ought not to lose and someone who perhaps let's say they're uncomfortable. They say well, maybe we'll put them in a We'll put them in a dream state for the rest of their life. Well, we would call that what a vegetative state there's the part of the difficulty of consciousness is We're not exactly sure what what all is going on in the brain We look at different waves and we we correlate those things to different other waves and where when we're awake and what can we can report? To but you know, we've got a lot of questions about these things now in in John Verveckis most recent he had a really good I think a really good treatment of Gnosticism and as always he dropped some really good resources in there And so I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna play a little bit about this and I a little bit from this this class Now this idea that Spirituality is ultimately about transcending the gods rather than serving the gods is very It's very both pertinent to us today and very radical for its time because you have basically the challenging of a not even a belief it was just an Unquestioned presupposition that our relationship to the gods was one of servitude and slavery Getting transformed into no. No the sense the core of spirituality is not worship The core of spirituality is self-transcendence He'll see that what he said right there even though he's talking about ancient Gnosticism There's a tremendous amount of the many many people who are And when people say I don't go to church because I'm spiritual but not really but not religious in many ways That's exactly what they're saying. I'm looking for self-transcendence. I'm looking to try to transcend the Suffering and struggles of my life the things that bother me. That's exactly how many people today are defining Spirituality or the spirituality they are seeking And hoping to live within and freeing people From existential entrapment and their suffering and that our mythology and our practices Should always be in service of us reuniting To who and what we are now we we we that now now we get into the seat this the secret sacred Self for many people again that same language they would say well I'm trying to connect with who I really am that there's a there's a true me that has been disconnected from me and now through these spiritual practices through these Transformative practices I now am going to connect up with that true me then when I realize the true me I will increasingly become the true me and I will transcend from my secret self I will transcend my current existence into this this true self and obviously he's talking about Gnosticism here We love this story notice how first of all it's still got all the platonic elements Here are the people trapped in the cave. They're bound They get the secret and the knowledge right that frees them so that they can return to And see the light right but of course for Plato you come back down into the cave the cave for the Gnostics You try to spread the message to as many people as you can so it has the Platonism It of course has a way of connecting that Platonism to Christianity By reinterpreting Jesus as a human being It of course has a way of connecting that Platonism to Christianity By reinterpreting Jesus as the embodiment of Gnosis rather than as a sacrifice in whom we should have faith Jesus is a teacher who provides us with Something like what the shaman did and what our therapist does provides us with the keys to unlocking Right unlock and and this is something I hear quite a bit from New age friends who oh I Jesus I can learn a lot from Jesus Jesus is in a sense my my guide my spirit guide into this and there's John is just articulating exactly Ancient Gnosticism, but also certain amount of contemporary Gnosticism Looking all the ways in which these patterns these sociocultural political economic patterns ways of thinking and being are just permeated into layers of our psyche and ways of being in the world that they just exacerbate Our suffering our existential entrapment in the way it is fragmenting our world and ripping apart our agency So we we long for that now this was hans jonas great insight We long for that now so we go to movies that show this right So the khanak goes through several movies that are basically modern portrayals of this gnostic mythology Of course famously and it brings both it brings all of these elements in the christian the The platonic and the gnostic of course is the matrix Right because the matrix is this You're entrapped in a world of illusion there are evil overlords We're trying to keep you entrapped so you don't ever discover who you truly are Right, but you know remember there's a scene in the movie you said you'd like you know like a splinter in your mind that there is something wrong And you don't belong right? That's the matrix or You can see a movie starring jim kip You can see a movie starring jim carrey the truman story notice, of course the play on words there Right truman truman discovering who you really are And he grows up in a world Right with an overlord that has manufactured and the overlord's name christoph christus To keep him from ever actually getting his true agency finding true love, etc And what he has to do is get the knowledge in order to get beyond this god We keep telling this story because it's a myth Because it keeps pointing us to patterns that are pervasive and profound and powerful And we can't quite articulate them and we can't quite know them But the myth at least gives us a moment of right at least narrative and symbolic recognition of our suffering I think that's Probably makes the point so anyway and watch the whole thing So you have the self-transcendence and that's the goal and and so we seek strategies and vehicles for experiencing the self-transcendence Self-transcendence and and you ultimately want to live in it where you master you and this is where we get into the circular me that I was referring to with with uh with brett weinstein's idea of well i'm programmed as a as an assassin robot, but all I need to do is Deny my programming and and in fact if you watch the matrix That's the entire struggle that neo is dealing with so after after morpheus releases him from the You know unplugs him from the matrix and then they plug him into their training program Morpheus keeps basically telling neo trying to show him in the context of the program. This is how You know, you're just in a program. This is just a building This is this is a you know, this is not ultimate reality and the entire point of the matrix is that neo realizes that you know he Can dominate this reality and it's a you know, of course the first of the three movies was the best But it's a very powerful image and and and even as I mentioned I'm going to mention my sunday school class that I taught last week because I wound up teaching this stuff, which is sort of the way it works in my sunday school class because a little bit later We'll get into what is a gospel But but you get into these questions of okay. Well, what is real? What is reality? Is the dream real? Yeah, the dream is the dream is real It's a real dream But the alarm alarm clock is more real and my my little famous now cell phone holder this is this is quite real, but in a sense I as the agent in this world and more real still because conscious agents with plans who Created the formal cause and you know, you look at aristotle's Four causes, you know devised this and mined the ore and you know composed You know created the metal to have these certain qualities. So it's it's quite rigid and you know dust They put this coating on it. So it doesn't you know, it doesn't rust and this is this is probably It's probably aluminum Maybe not. I don't know and and you know you put this hole in it So that back in the day when I bought this you could have your your power plug go in here And you could have the wire go through there if you wanted it to so it's just a nice little cell phone holder but we've got all of this design in it, so in a way this is real, but the the colonization The formation of this is in a way more real than the thing itself because it It controls it. It sets its destiny and someday this will head to a landfill and live in a landfill for who knows how long probably until Jesus comes again or some future generation digs it up and says I could use this metal Now As I said before we have this we have this business about virtual reality a bunch of people pointed me to this video that's sort of gone viral where a a real pastor I Just watched the language a real pastor. So I guess this is guy's a pastor in real life But he's in some virtual Reality room sort of like the matrix and A drumsy he Baptizes drumsy who's kind of an anime figure an anime girl and you know? Baptizes her in the name of the father son and holy spirit, but of course these are two people sitting in virtual reality rooms hundreds or Dozens or thousands of miles apart and there's no real water There and so here they have a virtual reality baptism but but notice how the the poster of the video quite smartly says real pastor instead of virtual pastor and we used real pastor to mean Someone who actually has flesh not a computer Simulation we maintain a bias for connection with the physical world And so even though in some ways the engineers and the Business see the engineers are both physical and mental they have mind but the business that created this Well, it has manifestations in paper and office buildings But the business itself is is not real in the sense that this is real But yet the business is more real in that in a sense it produces it so the The talking about reality is is not a simple thing Is the business more real or is the cell phone holder more real? Well, it depends what you mean by real. Well in this case is the baptism real when it's done in virtual reality Now if you listen to the video, you'll hear the pastor talk about, you know all of these you know, the water is god's love and He's making up fair amount. Well, i'll not criticize his theology right now, but You know, I watched and all kinds of thoughts go through my head as as as this guy is is doing his baptism Would you find a virtual? heaven sufficiently satisfying and actually often when I talk about the The ways in which a lot of contemporary Churches in America are gnostic Their eschatology is gnostic because they say something like well basically when you die you go to heaven to be with jesus Well, what about your body? Well, your body stays in the ground. Well, what do you what are you in heaven? Well, i'm a consciousness. I'm a free-floating consciousness. It's like i'm a virtual reality Avatar, but that's you know, there's no reality to me And every easter i'll talk about this and i'll differentiate this from what I think is Orthodox christianity, which is the belief in the resurrection Now now part of this is because in most cases our virtual worlds are dependent on our physical world So there's actually a server someplace that is hosting this meetup room Each of these people have their own computers. They have their own virtual reality headsets And so once again the virtual world is dependent on the physical world in cases like this But again when we get to consciousness the questions get tricky now this is in a way where we get into the simulation argument because Well, what if we we are quickly getting to the point that we can imagine fooling ourselves with representations We create on computers and there's a thing called the touring test which was developed by alan touring in 1950 And it's a test of a machine's ability to exhibits intelligent behavior equivalent to or indistinguishable from A human being and right now they've often tried to do this through speech and they keep doing this and saying when will we get? To the point that we can fool human beings and have them Talking to a computer but they but they think they're talking to another human being and this gets very complicated in terms of Definition but this this always sort of leans us into the simulation argument And of course this still is from elon musk at the recode conference where? Where josh topolski asks him, you know, what what are the odds that we're in base? Reality, what do you mean by base reality? the reality where like the alarm clock does to the dream or like on the Nebuchadnezzar which was the name of the matrix hovercraft where I forget what's his head? unplugs his Unplugs his fellow soldiers and kills them by unplugging them When they're in the matrix because it's like their brain is supposed to be in two places or something like that but but the the nebuchadnezzar in the matrix is base reality and the server And all the computer systems that in a sense is based reality upon which the virtual reality is dependent upon So elon musk is asked, you know, what are the odds that we're in? virtual reality well Basically the argument from the simulation goes how likely is it that we? Meaning us right here Got there first Or is it more likely that someone else did and that we are now? and that we are not living in base reality and that's Elon musk says billions to one which is wow. That's quite a stark statement and that the problem with the simulation argument is that it leads us to imagining that This consciousness we're experiencing is the product of some kid's pc in a basement Playing a really long computer game or that we would simulate ourselves or that aliens are simulating and you see right away What we are doing is concocting these alternate realities based on our own brains and imagining things based on the the furniture of our own world And that's not really what I think about when I think about the simulation argument. I think about basically a different fact which is that What if in fact well, we've been talking about this throughout pretty much the history of philosophy and when I when I talked about Um paul maxwell's video It is this wonderful little this wonderful little video where you could chart out the history of philosophy You know ancient philosophy has metaphysics modern philosophy focuses on epistemology postmodern philosophy focuses on axiology Metaphysics what is base reality? That's the question. And so the greeks were talking about that and playdo was talking about that It's the forms and aristotle kind of brings it back down to earth and the the pre-socratics, you know, it's it's change It's the swerve. It's you know, heraclitus all of these all of these philosophers asking What is base reality and by the time we get to to day cart? We have modern philosophy and now we're just basically focusing on epistemology. How can we have knowledge and then post? you know, it's interesting because that as as this history of philosophy develops we get more and more skeptical because by the time we hit the modern period well We can't know base reality So let's let's just camp on epistemology and by the time you get to post modernity Well, all that epistemology is corrupt because we're all motivated. And so what must we do and off a thousand other conversations go But if we get down to both donald hoffman and jordan peterson donald hoffman in his ted talk, which you can find Do we see reality as it is donald hoffman says no Evolutionarily not that's we we are not tooled to see Reality as it is donald hoffman asserts, but we are tooled for for tricks and hacks Donald hoffman says and that's not actually far from what jordan peterson says in terms of well We see this this low resolution image. That's good enough to help us get in the world Now that doesn't mean that there isn't a reality out there that we're engaging with but it's donald hoffman says there's there's an interface Well, well that sounds kind of weird But if you stop and you think about well, i'm using my eyes and as I get older my eyes are You know less and less my eyes are not what they were 20 years ago. They're still pretty good I still don't have to wear glasses, but They're not what they were 20 years ago And so sometimes text is a little bit fuzzy and I have to hold things out a little bit far But it's it's good enough For what I need to do and if I need to do something a little bit better I'll take a pair of reading glasses and i'll put that on and and then it'll be a little bit better and and so Well, it's it's it's an interface that I use and we know that dogs eyes don't see like our eyes do Flies eyes don't see like our eyes do certain shrimp can see more colors than we can see Some women can see more colors than men can see You know so on and so forth that that we don't but but we see enough to be able to manipulate and to interact with this reality with this with this stuff with this world Outside ourselves, but we are in fact engaging in an interface of of sorts and the interface is actually It's built into us Peterson's a prior argument in terms of his conversation with sam harris But but it but it also it's it's a meeting between the two worlds in a sense So we use a priori sorting mechanism to see the world And you know again if you go back to revaki stuff, I look at this and it's it's graspable and and graspability is not a Is not a property of this thing itself necessarily it's it's something that That we bring into it in in terms of when we're all together and here's a well, here's a clock And and you know graspability, but if I were going to throw something well depends on This has various aspects of graspability for me, but it's kind of light and this is a little bit heavier And so we have all these qualities and of course, i've got the the stapler's pretty heavy You got all these things but other things aren't nearly as graspable well You know this this this tripod. Well, this is kind of grass, but this is swingable You know, and you've got all these and this is sort of mountable So you have all these properties that are here and then I look at my water bottle My water bottle is very graspable and you know, all this is built in On we go And then the a little bit of this this video with um rupert cheldrake who's very interesting character And and he walks through and it's this video is there something rather than nothing and he he quotes laurence krauss's book Is there something right? You know, is there something dealing with is there something rather than nothing and he notes that actually the increasingly the the atheist the atheist physicists and scientists are Have pretty much a similar argument as religious people They just get really annoyed at religious language because supposedly laws of nature are pre-existent and universal which is sort of like the logos as you would find in in in john one and genesis one Well john one written over into genesis one and this quantum vacuum Which is sort of energy is basically the spirit that's blowing over the wind that's blowing over the waters And boom there you have creation The only question of course is the difference of mind And personal or impersonal so you have all this Volatility or non-volatility and so really the great divide is whether something is personal or impersonal And what I increasingly bump into is that we are deeply troubled by the question of whether or not there is a will greater than our own Now this to me this fascinates me because as thomas nagel Tries to get at with his book mind and cosmos that we've sort of reached the end of this Objectivistic approach to the world and we recognize that unless we bring in subjectivity one way or another We really can't find a path forward But but we we don't really want there to be a god Because well why because a god is going to be doing picking and choosing and we don't want a god We don't want anybody else picking and choosing for us Especially not someone we trust and maybe if there are other human beings Maybe we'll think they're people of goodwill and so on and so forth But we hope to be the top willful agent or at least be part of that class And we look around and imagine if I as a moral agent were planning the universe I would do so with less suffering and less waste and in fact almost every debate I hear between Apologists and celebrity atheists has this subtext running beneath it that I would be more that I am more moral than any god You might imagine or find in the bible and then so often the apologists are kind of backtracking and trying to You know spruce up there in a sense the rider on the back of the god elephant and they're trying to improve his Reputation by reading bible verses in one way or another and i've done the same thing But if that but what it looks it's all really built on is a thousand years of christianity that um That you really need to have the problem of evil that we have today Well, why do I say that because if you? Had pretty much like the ancients or other civilizations around the world if you looked out into nature you wouldn't be under any You wouldn't be under any idea That nature should be good to you in fact nature was Horribly dangerous for you, and you had to do everything you could just to stay alive. You didn't have a meaning crisis, but You sure wanted to eat So so what happens I think after a thousand years of christianity after all of this messaging that well God number one the god of the universe is good and it's built in well Suddenly we're thinking now we could do better And if if there is a god, you know, certainly we wouldn't have all this waste if we were running a simulation We would make it much happier for the people. Of course, you can watch the matrix. They actually discussed that in that movie, too All of these ideas we actually get from the gospels well What are the gospels? So the gospels are these books these four books at the beginning of the new testament that have the stories of jesus And i'm just starting in my adult sunday school class Um a study on the the gospel of john and so I began begin with it asking about what the gospels are C.S. Lewis has a a really nice little write-up on gospels. Come on microsoft. You can do it. What's the what's the deal? Just pull up that website I'll put the link in the notes. I don't know why this is Literature in the gospel genre C.S. Lewis writes whatever these men may be whatever these men may be as biblical critics. I discuss I distrust them as critics They seem to lack any literary judgment To be imperceptive about the very quality of the text they are reading It sounds a it sounds It sounds a strange charge to bring against the men who have been steeped in these books all their lives But that might be just the trouble a man who has spent his youth and manhood In minute study of new testament texts and of other people's studies of them whose literary experience of these texts lacks any standard of comparison such Such as can only grow from a wide deep and genial experience of literature In general is I should think very unlikely to miss the obvious thing about them If he tells me that something in a gospel is legend or romance I want to know how many legends or romances he has read How well his palate is trained in detecting them by the flavor and how many years he has spent on that gospel I've been reading poems romances vision literature legends myths all my life I know what they are like. I know that not one of them is like this Of this text there is are there are only two possible views either. This is reportage Though it may no doubt contain errors pretty close up to the facts nearly as close as boswell Or else some unknown writer in the second century without known predecessors or successors suddenly anticipated the whole technique of modern novelist Realistic narrative if it is untrue it may be narrative of that kind The reader who doesn't see that is simply not learned to read That's c.s. Lewis's take on what the gospels are and you can read richard bacham's study of jesus and the eyewitnesses Where he goes through all the namings and and again Well, it was very interesting in my sunday school class just to a group of People who are churchwomen and they're not really religious I said to a group of People who are church-going people I said well, what is a gospel and they worked on things a little bit and one woman says Well, it's history ah It's history now if you're Know anything about history, you know that History itself is a complicated word, but It is history it it is c.s Lewis lays this out quite nicely in the grand miracle Which is a doodle that you can find on youtube or you can read it and c.s Lewis's book miracles it is it is a story that fits into the rest of the story and illuminates the world And now myths do that so it is Mythological in that sense, but it is also history and c.s Lewis goes through the fact that in fact, it's quite important that The miracles you can't take out of the miracles out of christianity like you could out of islam or buddhism or or Just about any other religion because the miracles function in a particular way in christianity Precisely because it is history when we get into this question of reality Now one of the one of the great things that i've been picking up by listening to john verveckis class are all the ways that religions provoke mental Transformations there's lots of ways and lots of religions and lots of ways of seeing the events on the ground differently and and john has really helped me understand christianity and other religions and And humanity and cognitive science. He's continuing to do that so much better throughout this entire class where I see all these transformations that happen via texts and rituals and You know all of these things that he's been laying out. There's lots of ways of modulating the meaning for a particular event One of the best examples, I think of this Is the movie life is beautiful, which I I like the movie I heard a thing with zizek who I guess he doesn't like the movie, but zizek is zizek life is beautiful is this incredible movie where in the midst of a Of a nazi death camp this father tries to spare not only the life of his son But the mental outlook of his little boy the anguish of watching all of these people die And the whole movie is basically him pulling the wool over on german guards one way or another making his little boy think that this German this nazi death camp is actually a big game And at the end he might win a prize such as a tank and if you've never seen the movie watch the movie It's an amazing movie But but it's it in many ways illustrates a lot of the stuff that john vervecki is is talking about that there are these Transformations that the that the father is doing on the son in order to Reframed all of the events into other events for the son Okay, so you transform the experience by transforming the story or your experience of the events and and and to a great degree This is what we do with suffering and meaning There's an event that is causing suffering and then via meaning you reframe it and you can in fact Then try to eliminate suffering now, obviously with with buddhism suffering can be caused by the delta of of desire and experience or Eliminate expectation or eliminate desire and therefore you can eliminate suffering. These are all mental techniques and tricks Not only by individuals but civilizations Therefore you use meaning to to you leverage meaning in order to reduce suffering to give meaning and purpose and to Basically help you get through life and both peterson and vervecki talk about this quite a bit in their own different ways Now this is in contrast to the continuous cosmos Approach where you're using agency or power to tailor the story to your liking and so when Vervecki is talking about alexander the great he talks about alexander the great is kind of a step back to a continuous cosmos approach alexander conquers the world and tailors the world to his liking this axial age two story now There to somebody had mentioned in the comments, you mean the two stories in terms of a house Yeah, it's also two story as in terms of the other meaning of story the story works both ways You have a you have two stories going on. It's the interaction of those stories or it's two stories in a house and so alexander the great in a sense says now i'm just going to retail i'm just going to Reshape the world according to my liking Okay, but if you don't have that kind of power or agency in the world Then you default to some of these other techniques where you say well my life is i'm a slave and You know, i've been sold out by my brothers and I was doing pretty well in potiphar's house But then mrs. Potiphar took a liking to me and she lied about it now i'm stuck in jail But god has a purpose for my life And that somehow then you know helps reduce the suffering if your poor joseph stuck in slave prison in egypt Now john has i haven't really Treated yet episode 16 which I know a number of you have asked me to and i'll probably get around to it His treatment of christianity at the end of episode 15 was really quite dramatic because here he he shows how agape Is used to transform and it's not only used to transform The meaning that we attach to events, but it's also actually used to transform people's lives and so a baby or The book of ezekiel has a wonderful story of a a king who who picks up a an abandoned baby And and raises her to be queen now. There's Mental transformation and there's physical transformation and and so then we get into recognizing how agape Can actually bring physical transformation into this world and this is why I say that The company now a company is not a physical thing a company has physical aspects around it But the company itself is not a physical thing is in some ways more real than The product it made There's some aspects in which you might say well this is more real Than the company the company could go out of business and this thing could endure physical things have that quality but The meaning of agape is that The meaning of this now it's interesting because i've used this in a number of my videos I have actually added meaning to this little cell phone holder It's not actually in the cell phone holder, but let's say someday I become probably after my death my videos become enormously famous and Someone finds, you know, maybe my kids need money and they say we're gonna sell off all the props In dad's office and so who wants the cell phone holder? That paul vanderkley used in his reality video. How about the stapler, you know, maybe 100 bucks for the cell phone holder. We don't even have cell phones anymore. They're planted in our brains maybe maybe 150 for the stapler one heck of a ripoff At the estate sale at the vanderkley's But you get my point here that These transformations happen and agape is this transformative power that turns slaves into citizens and in fact That transformative power over a great number of decades did just that turn slaves into citizens You know both in the medieval evil period and then in the american period now at um Christianity also uses axial type two-story cosmology to transform Jesus says store up treasures in heaven where moth and rust don't consume. That's what he admonishes and And you're suffering when you're suffering you're doing so for the lord. So christianity actually uses multiple Techniques that other religions use and to reframe the story Says okay, so you're living in a You're living in a death chamber, which is planet earth. We all die You're living in a death chamber and maybe your circumstances within this death chamber are uncomfortable by virtue of the story We will transform your experience within this world other religions do that too And also promises change in the events on the ground and that's where this next level comes into play The miracles in christianity Are used not only in kind of the traditional way miracles were used to show divine favor To show divine authority upon a person In fact, I asked my Sunday school class You know, it's likely nobody in alexander's period. They knew that his father was philip of macedonia They probably knew exactly who his mother was yet. They called alexander the great a son of god Well, why is alexander the great the son of god? Well because of what he did And you think well, that's not how we use sun Right. We tend to think about the word sun biologically In the ancient world they often used sun in terms of authority all right, and so you'd see the caesars adopting sons to be caesar and Uh alexander the great is the son of philip of macedonia And I don't know the mother's name, but they called him a son of god not because he was born of a god but because his Aspects were godlike and that's why John vervecky says, you know, this is back to the continuous cosmos Continuous cosmos Impression of the world it's not the right word So miracles well miracles often are used to demonstrate power divine authority and in fact with roman catholicism now, i'll probably get this wrong because i'm not roman catholic, but Before someone is canonized as a saint there they need to have performed a miracle and in a sense It's using miracles in demonstrating divine divine authority and sanctity But but jesus used miracles not only for that but also as signs and in the gospel of john as I go through the Gospel of john in my sunday school class We'll call it signs. They're signs of the age to come they point to the age to come so water to wine Well, this was this was showing the abundance Of the age to come right there at the wedding of cana in a sense you pull something from the future Into the present you pull something From that age to come into the present and as i've said before Christianity tells time in a particularly interesting way in a sense You have the present evil age and you have the age to come but they overlap and so christians live in the overlap between The present evil age the age of decay as I call it and then the age to come That's where christians live and that was started at the resurrection of jesus Jesus And so what jesus is doing and you can read c.s Lewis's miracles about that miracles of the old creation miracles of the new creation. I like the way he he lays that out Jesus is is showing signs of the reality of the age to come. It's not just power He's embodying What is to come in what he's showing the people and now the greatest miracle then is the resurrection where his future body and our future bodies come into the present which is why in the new testament the apostles keep talking about the the end times we're in the last days because of the resurrection of jesus And that gets us back to this word-based reality. What if jesus resurrected body is to this world As your alarm clock is to your dream world I'm going to read that again What if jesus resurrected body is to this world as your alarm clock is to your dream world Your alarm clock impinges into this world. It is more real than your dream Jesus resurrected body does the same in gospel stories In a sense, so do the loaves and fishes but not like jesus body And so that's why the new testament always talks about the last days The message of christianity is the promised participation In jesus body now meaning in that case Metaphorically, but that's basically the assertion of first corinthians 15 Now sometimes people ask why do you paul continue to insist in the bodily resurrection of jesus? It is because of my idea of reality Reality that just as the alarm clock or the phone or the crying baby or the annoying dog or the sun opens your eyes and Colonizes and invades and Temporarily destroys your dream world Well jesus resurrected body invades this world And well, it's a greater. It's a deeper level of reality. It's base Reality, that's what christianity says so Words that fudge reality and the resurrection
