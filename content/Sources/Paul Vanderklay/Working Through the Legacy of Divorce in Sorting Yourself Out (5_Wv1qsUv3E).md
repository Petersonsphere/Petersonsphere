 We'll get started. So tell me about now. Do you go by you go by Lee? I go by Lee. Yeah, I'm named after my dad. So he's also Scott Lee Cooper. So I got Lee he got Scott. Okay, okay, okay. So tell me a little bit about yourself. Yeah, so I teach sixth grade math. I'm a math teacher. I'm a teacher in Colorado Springs. I'm about to start into my fourth year as a teacher. So I'm actually teaching summer school right now. I did that today so that was pretty fun. And then let's see I grew up in a small town in Colorado, Buena Vista, Colorado. And then lived a little bit in Greeley. That's where I met my wife. So I've been married for about three years. We have a five-month-old. So he's a lot of fun. Wow, awesome. Yeah, yeah. So between him and the dogs you might hear him in the background but you know that's pretty on par for your videos from what I can tell. Yeah, yeah. Dogs are fine. Yeah, so yeah. So I'm married about three years and it's been really awesome with the new baby. So and yeah I've been telling people I've been rediscovering the world vicariously through him. So you know he just found his feet and I was like that's so cool and he's putting his foot in his mouth and it's just like yeah it's really awesome. So yeah. Great, wonderful. Yeah, so what you know why I'm here, why I want to talk to you a little bit. What's on your mind? Yeah, so I have a lot of things. I have some notes around me, just some like different talking points. I guess the first thing I wanted to do is just to kind of reestablish the pattern of you know how did I find you, how did I find Jordan Peterson, where did that come about. So it actually was the 2016 election. Trump had won. I was at a very progressive school. I came in the day that you know they was announced that Trump had won and I'm not like I mean I'm not exaggerating like the whole office was tears. Everybody was crying and very upset. The population we served was mostly Hispanic and basically they were like everything's over, it's done. And so you know it was it was very traumatic for the people I was working with and I just I didn't know a whole lot. I had never really followed much with politics or religion or philosophy and just kind of had been going with the flow of the culture at the time. So I wanted to know more. So I asked my brother you know like you know I want to find out more like what's going on like what is this really like you know some awful racist thing that's happening and so I kind of got into the political thing of it and he said you should listen this podcast on Joe Rogan's podcast that you know this guy Jordan Peterson you should check him out. So I did and I checked out that first podcast and then you know from there I definitely was hooked pretty you know like I guess pretty standard like you know went down the rabbit hole and just thought they might fall into Napsa meaning and listening to all those and was listening to him as they were coming out and listening to the biblical series as those are coming out and just just very much so hooked. I was actually re-listening to some of it and a quote stood out to me and I kind of want to go I guess towards that but I said the world of narrative will open up for you and that's definitely been the case and like it's really helped me to to map my own problems to figure out you know what's going on with other people and just to have this narrative structure that we're living in and then you know from listening to you I've also recently been listening to a lot of John Brevecky and just been very intrigued with that I think that you know John Brevecky provides a lot of the I guess meat that I maybe I don't want to say Peterson glosses over but you know that the underlying structure that the underlying story that I think is sometimes missing there and then so that's been very very helpful for me to listen to John Brevecky you know I think Peterson too when I listen to his stuff like John Brevecky for instance you know he'll talk about the salience right the salience landscape and but he'll just say that right he packs his words very tightly you know for at least for me like I have to definitely pay attention very closely versus Peterson will be like oh well let me tell you about the story of have you ever seen the gorilla video thing but really is getting at the same point right yeah yeah so yeah some things that I guess I just wanted to talk about a little bit how did I so I definitely consider myself a Christian I didn't always consider myself a Christian my wife and I have become very involved in our church we do a lot with the children's ministry we do a lot with helping with that you know on Sundays and teaching and those kinds of things doing check-ins so become very involved there and then I you know as far as a church journey goes we I mean we did we just kind of went to the church that was closest to our house to begin with and we're trying that and that's when we were living up in Denver and then we moved down here we weren't sure what we were gonna do so we actually found it was a friend of a friend and he had started a church and we ended up going there and they had a podcast series and I was like well I'm in you know I'm definitely I'm in the podcast and they had you know it was an apologetic series so I kind of joined in with that but yeah it was it was a it was a long journey for me I guess like really becoming Christian and I think that as I lived the narrative more as I you know tried to embody it as I tried to you know go to church and you know I think I was kind of within that religious fictionalism as they you know they talk about but as I kind of lived it more I like I feel like I would say at this point now that God was drawing me closer in and to the point where I was like okay you know like I'm ready to believe and you know I'm ready even believe that you know he rose again all that so it was a you know it was a big step for me but yeah definitely and then got baptized pretty recently as well so yeah that was kind of I guess my journey into things but you know I like I said you raised a Christian um so I was raised Christmas and Easter kind of Christian and you know there was a period where we did go quite a bit my mom was I think in her own meaning crisis and she became very much so Christian for a while but she's definitely not in that anymore she's very much so she's very conspiratorial and conspiratorial she gets very into I mean we don't have to go deep into that but yeah exactly but you know I yeah so she's it's definitely you know more of a but I guess the reason I bring it up is because I enjoy having conversations with her and you know I still will have like you know conversations about Peterson or conversations about something I heard from you or you know so I still we still are very much so in dialogue with each other which is good yeah um okay so where do I want to go I wasn't sure what I want to talk about and I had like I said a lot of ideas but one of the things I didn't want to do was be boring especially I've been very nervous about that with your friend saying he's like oh yeah those conversations are boring I'm like oh crap he says what he thinks so it's okay um but I want to actually talk a little bit about I guess what did the meaning crisis because you know I'm just kind of looking at this verveky lens right now what did the meaning crisis mean for me and like why was it so attractive and looking at Peter Pan really that's kind of where I want to talk about so when I was listening to verveky the first thing that I listened to the the music it's Eric Satie or Satie Eric Satie I think he said it the background music that he has to his you know the intro music yeah so I heard that and I just had this like really emotional response to it and I was trying to figure out why I was trying to figure out like where I'd heard it before so I actually heard it in this movie that you probably are not familiar with called Mr. Nobody it's Jared Leto was this our movie I know it a bit my kids have watched it a few times okay it's like what's going on with this guy so I haven't sat down and watched it but they say it's a great movie yeah and a lot of people say this is the best movie ever seen oh it's so deep it's so meaningful and as I tried to analyze it more I realized that it's it's a Peter Pan story that's really what it is and the whole point of the movie and you know this is something I want to kind of get into too but it's it's it's basically a kid who is faced with this difficult decision and he has to either go with his mom or go with his dad right like they're getting a divorce he's a nine-year-old is on a railroad track right and obviously you can see the symbolism there and they say where is it that you what are you gonna do you know who are you going with and then it kind of shows all these different scenarios of his life but he is the nine-year-old gets to see all these scenarios he gets to see his future and he gets to see you know all the futures to come and then has all these different relationships with these different women like wife number one or wife number two wife number three I remember some of that yeah yeah and it's kind of based on these different decisions that he makes within his life you know that he's whether he's not with this wife or you know some in some of the scenarios he dies or in some of the scenarios you know and then the final scenario he's just he's an old man talking through all these scenarios right and so I don't know that movie was really intriguing for me and I think it's really intriguing for a lot of people they see it as this deep movie but the end of it it just says there you know there is no right path and that's kind of the message of the story that there is no right path any of the past could have been a good path and you know I think that that messaging is definitely Peter Pan messaging right it's the reason that he's called Mr. Nobody and the reason you know he explains it at the end of the movie is because he doesn't you know he doesn't choose his damn sacrifice as Peterson says right he doesn't pick his sacrifice and he's just that little boy stuck at the railroad station trying to make the decision now I want to go back to that part because I mean as a child having to make that decision like that is you know it creates this like I would you know I want to call it I'm a math guy like a singularity in that kid's life right like it that's a that's a decision that a kid shouldn't have to make right that's it that kids shouldn't have to take on that responsibility but you know as adults we I think that you have to watch that movie differently as an adult but you know like for people who are watching that they maybe had divorced parents they're not watching it as the adult they're watching it as that kid on that track and they're feeling his emotion and actually when he's making that decision that's the same music and that's what I was saying I had that emotional response that John Ravicki uses in his background it's actually a little bit of a different version but it's the Eric Sate music right and and that's where I was like okay that's where I remember that from that's where I have that emotional response so I mean the movie poses this question though is how do we make difficult decisions and you know I think kind of the answer that the movie gives is again there is no right path and that we have to we have to kind of make reasons for ourselves right and that you just you just kind of choose something and you make a good reason about why this is good and I'm like I don't know I was like that's not good enough right and and this is where I really enjoy the what I'm listening to a John Ravicki and him talking about features and the gestalt right the structure like what is the structure that we're talking about and it's like that structure is not good enough for me right like it's it's too random there's not there's too much just whatever you just choose the path and you make the best of it how can we have a better structure and then I was like okay so how do we make good decisions and so I was kind of going down that path and I was thinking how have I made decisions and I think like honestly it goes back to Jordan Peterson's with his self authoring right and that for me was extremely useful that's something that I did I actually did the whole self authoring suite I did the past authoring the present authoring and the future authoring and you know from that I actually recently this last semester I got a master's degree you know we had a baby I I moved to I tried to set myself up better financially you know all these things that kind of lined my life up and it's like that's how you make hard decisions right like through this for me you know through this this planning of the future and that future authoring program like I know I feel like I'm advertising for it but that's really what it is right like you have to plan out your future and plan out your future for yourself and for the people around you and then that's how you make those hard decisions is you know how is this going to line up with that plan that I have and it's not just about me and what reasons I can make for myself but how is this gonna be good for my family how is this gonna be good for my community so and you know the other huge part that I guess I'm missing here that I that I think definitely needs to be said is the the aspect of choice and the aspect of you know what Verveki talks about with the God of the open future that you know I'm you know I kind of look at Mr. Nobody now and I'm like no that's crap because the futures all these different futures that he could see it's like it's not defined the future is open and we get to define that through our choices and that for me was extremely empowering I think just you know listening to Peterson and that's that for me was what I guess I needed to hear is that you know it's not just some path that I just have to make the best of but it's like no you get to forge that path and you get to forge that path you know and right now I'm thinking you know with Christ and with his plan you know so that was just very empowering for me yeah and helped me to I guess become to come out of that that meaning crisis and you know you just stop being the Peter Pan just you know to to to live the narrative to take on responsibility all those things right like to have that idea that I could forge the future so so what so what would you so if someone hasn't seen the verveki video and you then they heard you say this they say well this meaning crisis well what exactly is the meaning crisis especially given given how you've laid it out with mr. nobody and and what then what then is the meaning crisis is it is it I mean for Peterson it's very much a function of I mean if you listen to Peterson he'll say you know make a goal mm-hmm so a goal and it's in the it's in the pursuit of the goal not even in the attainment of the goal but it's in the pursuit of the goal that you will experience meaning mm-hmm and that's true but mr. nobody part of it is that well you know he doesn't decide and and so maybe there's no meaning in that but it's I mean part of I think built into that and I haven't watched the movie so I probably don't have it right but the message that there is no right path that isn't necessarily contradictory to Peterson's goal oriented meaningful experience mm-hmm because in a sense Peterson he doesn't really say this and I think and and it would be unfair to say any goal is good you know he would very much say there are some goals that are better than other goals and you can pick that and in that sense he's he's not that far away from Sam Harris but you you know when you wish upon a star well can you do you know which star you should wish upon yeah no that's really interesting and I guess for myself as far as you know I don't know I'm not as you know learned as I wish I was I'm trying to but you know you don't have that time yet yeah so your mistakes trust me so I think it's hard for me to define what what you know because going to your original question like how would I you know kind of look at the meaning crisis in that way and how would I define that for myself and I don't know I think I just kind of I feel it more in like you know little little elements of what I can see going on and you know I guess this indecisiveness that that is a big part of it for me that like you know we have we just are in this feeling of being stuck and we don't know where to go or how to get there or why we want to go you know like why are we trying to get somewhere I just think about like I don't know even little things so like my sister for instance like she had she has any mini-mini-mo right for what she wants to decide and it can be something really little like what pair of shoes am I gonna wear and she just can't make that decision you know she has to kind of do that and so I don't know it's like we do need that guiding light right so we need that I guess that something to move towards in order to so I guess I'm looking at it you know in a very pragmatic sense like that Peterson does right like how is it that we were going to be able to live in the world in a way that's not just you know we're not stuck but I guess the reason of like why are we doing that I don't I yeah I mean at this point you know where I'm at I'm just I guess I just tack on and I don't want to say I don't want to diminish it but for me I'm like okay how are we how am I bringing glory to God you know that's kind of where I've been now and how am I you know like I guess how am I following scripture in that way and that's what I'm I guess you know trying to move towards and trying to learn more about right well and I think you know so again I've said this in a number of places and I continue to refine my saying of it the definition the definition of a good culture is that it enables people to make better choices than their age affords them and so you know I think you know when I just listened to the your short autobiography you know I very much affirm the you've decided to take on in a sense what you do when you decide okay I'm going to I'm going to become a Christian and that's it and you very much okay this is a choice that you're making I'm going to become a Christian I am going to attend a church I am going to and what you do in a sense is you take on all of this these presets and you say to the degree that I'm able to this is the way I'm going to pursue my life and so you you met a woman you fell in love you made a commitment you got married you had a child you took on a vocation you got education and in many ways as a young man in my opinion you've set yourself up well because the decisions and the commitments that you've made now you you don't know here's the thing and and as you get older you'll learn this because you and your wife over the next 30 years will continue to change your is it a son or a daughter son okay son your son boy your son is gonna change fast and the five the difference between a five month old and an eight month old you're gonna be like wow and then an eight month old to a year old you know eight month old he'll start crawling it'll be oh now you're gonna look at the house in a whole new way okay we got a kid proof the house and then he'll be upright and start toddling and and go to one to two to three to four and and it's just gonna go whoosh and so what's going to happen is that even though you've set a lot of goals as you go some of those goals are gonna be like that one's not right or we can't hit that one and so the smaller goals and so in a sense the big goals and big commitments that you've made are actually going to put you in a direction which I think is a good thing and the fact that you have decided to do this in community with a church you know in relationship to others in my opinion those are all really good decisions and they're better decisions than you can make now because you just really haven't had time and there's actually no way to know enough to achieve the outcomes that you think you want and that's sort of what life does and the reasons why right like even the you know the deeper understanding of why which I'm trying to map out more I'm trying to embody more I just know that it has you know definitely improved my life and it has brought meaning to my life and I think you know I'm still trying to figure out okay but why you know why is this still really good and you know what you're saying you're saying you know in your opinion it is a good thing and I'm trying you know to continue to I guess like really embody why is this a good thing why should I continue down this path right so I'm planning on talking to John Vervecki this week and one of the things that I'm gonna send him an email maybe after this and say this is something he said well whatever you want to talk about this fine yeah but but one of the one of the things is that there's a real there's a real sense now that the the religious path is unavailable to people and I deeply appreciate that because I talked to a number of people and you can see him on my channel for whom you know the idea of belief it's it's a you know it's a bridge too far but but I I certainly don't believe that it's not available to anyone and the reason I don't believe it's not available to anyone is because you're living proof that it's available to you and I whereas people will say well some of this isn't justifiable or defensible I certainly don't see it that way and and and I actually do think that a lot of the a lot of the a lot of the decisions that you've made at your stage in life right now beginning a career beginning a family beginning a marriage it's just full of meaning now 10-15 years into this yeah meaning will beginning will begin to change probably and morph because things will come up in your life that you'll be like I didn't plan on this and and some of these things will be negative and then you'll have to adjust but one of the beautiful things is that and I think Peterson is right in terms of this experience of meaning some of those heavy burdens some of those heavy crosses will find you and they will not be the definition of crosses is often you know things we must bear but don't really want to bear and of course Peterson would say you know what we try to do often is avoid them and Peterson is right is that no don't avoid them face them square on pick them up and and wrestle with them and that's that's really good advice so I that the Peter Pan aspect is really interesting because Peter Pan in a sense is the opposite of the Peterson admonition because he looks at the scary future of the boy becoming a man and says no and even never never land you know it's no time and of course Captain Captain Hook has you know the is terrified of the crocodile with the ticking clock yeah tick tick tick you know it's it's a there are a lot of symbolism in that story yeah that's where you know I definitely tied it into that movie too with the mr. nobody because you know that that is it right like he is nobody and Peter Pan like you know he is nobody right like yes like and that's where I really like listening to Akira the Don's stuff too when he comes out with it it just yeah but he had one recently that was actually on Peter Pan but yeah you know it was it was Peterson talking about that where he says you know when you're a kid it's like you can be anything you can be anybody but you're not anything and you're not every every everything right like at this point you are nobody but you all you are is potential but unless you actualize that potential right like you're just that's all you are they're just nobody and so yeah that really kind of struck me as well and the strange things the strange things that will happen is now you're you made a commitment to a specific woman you've had a specific child you're working a specific job you live in a specific place you go to a specific church all of that potential in time begins to manifest in specific things that then both limit and cut off certain potentials the Mr. Nobody if you had married these other women well things would be different the child would be different and and but yeah all of those specifics then manifest in new potentials that it's a it's a fascinating thing that this like yeah well and and and I want to say freeing in some ways right because I want to go back to you know something that my wife and I just really like listening to and will often share with people and you know there's a there's a little clip of it but it's Peterson talking about marriage and you know he starts out like that's why people get married you know and he goes through the whole you know I love that clip it's a great clip yeah so you know I watched that over and over you know and it just I really you know believe in that and you know and that there is a very much so like a freeing this within the unity of marriage right that I'm not leaving you no matter what so let's let's be free to be our so like you know I don't want to be ourselves sorry but let's be free to to open ourselves up to each other right to to be able to share you know share the thing that you know that goddamn thing that came up of you know however long ago you know and be able to share those things with each other and to know that you know that person is there with you and that you do have that structure and the same thing with the church right like that you're committing yourself to that church so that way you can you know open yourself up I I don't know I don't want to sound like buzzwords but emotionally right you're opening yourself up into your story to your narrative to you know to be able to I guess you know not wall yourself off but you know it'd be vulnerable in that way so although you know there are those boundaries it is freeing in that way yeah it's both freeing and then eventually the crosses come and what's beautiful about that and and this is something that our culture in its in its in how it defines self how it imagines self actualization to be which is you know somehow I always get what I want and enjoy in every moment as it goes forward you know what happens with those commitments is that you get placed into that things hard things come into your life that you can't change and then what that gives you is in fact the kind of muscle that carrying heavy crosses up the hill actually produce and and this then becomes a differentiation because a lot of people throw down the cross or or stay at the bottom of the hill and say it's too hard it's too heavy I'll go find I'll go find something easy somewhere else but it's it's exactly those things which are the fruit of the things you're taking now that in the future actually make you turn you into a person of substance that's such an interesting phrase and and and in terms of Christianity it's it's those things that make saints and in you know what what we ought to aspire to as Christians are to become saints the the the problem with becoming saints is that the path to sainthood is a path that nobody really wants or sometimes even willfully chooses but it's a path of binding and it's but that's that is the story that we are born into and encouraged to pursue so yeah no and will never be a saint yeah no yeah um okay so I have a just kind of my notes I didn't want to be too prepared but I wanted to you know have substance good don't be boring yeah don't be boring that was the goal so I actually wanted to talk real quick because I'm you know I'm a very proud father about my son so Sam I named him Samuel and part of where I got Samuel from I want to say that it was purely biblical I mean mostly was like me and my wife looking at some biblical names and going oh let's go with Samuel it's actually really cool right now because our church is actually going through first and second Samuel and reading through the book and so that's been really enriching for me but I actually chose it based on a book that I really enjoyed East of Eden so a lot of where I live my world and my life is that is through narrative right is through looking at different stories like I was you know talking about Mr. Nobody or Peter Pan or I'll you know constantly think about how does this relate to these you know like the Lion But it was definitely a really impactful story for me East of Eden and one of the things in there I don't know how actually biblical accurate this is but the Thou mayest right like the Tim Shell line in there I don't know if you know the book or remember the book so I mean long it's you know it definitely goes through you have the good father you have all these you know archetypal structures within the book and Samuel being the good father but also you know I was listening to Peterson something that he said in there was you know you want to be the good father but you also want to be the hero you also want to be the son right and it's like you got to embody both of those things at the same time you know and so that's kind of like I guess where I'm at my journey right like I'm trying to how am I gonna be the good father but also be you know embody this other archetype and how am I you know living that out and I don't it just really I guess helped me too and like in the book and as I read it more and like you know kind of analyze the character of Samuel you know he becomes he is the you know throughout the story he is this this hero character he's this great hero character but also this it's good father at the same time and you know at the very end of the book I shouldn't you know that the very end but he has this point where his kids kind of derive a plan for him where you know he's basically gonna live out his days by bouncing from kid to kid and you know they're like one of the sons so it's really bad about that because you know he doesn't want his father to become complacent he doesn't want him to become you know not not this this great hero that he sees him has and and what's really awesome and I think just I really like how Steinbeck just wrote it is that the you know Samuel the father he realizes the plan and he confronts his son about it he says Tom like you know there's there's there's some foolery going on here like I understand what's happening and but it's you know like I'm going to choose that and you know it's okay and I you know like I'm I'm going to go into that place I'm gonna become that that just you know that that father and then you know he ends up like later in the book kind of becoming this ghostly figure you know he all three are there right he hit like later in the book Tom is like talking to him and you know he's having this this deep moral conundrum within himself and he's talking to his father who's not there anymore you know what I mean and being guided by his father you know his the spirit of his father and just I don't know so it just is really impactful for me to see that just in a narrative and then and then when you think about that is like okay and then there's really the father there really is Christ there really is the Holy Spirit and seeing those you know how all three of those can be one you know and talking about things as I'm getting a leg cramp yes it's hard saying hydrated how things can be separate you know like these all they can be differentiated but one all at the same time and you know I've been just really enthralled by that idea as well recently and yeah I don't know so that was just something that just thinking through them being able to talk through that it's just it's awesome it's I don't know I don't know good words for it but so why why bath and not English you certainly have a love of story oh so actually I want to take a stab at your question why do you get people who have math and who have art yes you know I'd love to know I want to take a stab at it and I think that verveky helped me this this is my theory and you know maybe people in the comments can agree or disagree but I think it really goes to this idea of scaling up and scaling down and the idea of features and the gestalt that he talks about that you know and you've mentioned in your videos too like how do you describe a bird okay like it has a beak it has wings you can throw it in the air but is that a bird no because you don't have the gestalt you don't have the idos you don't have the structure of that right so when I think about that and I think about myself I consider myself a craftsman so for instance one of the things and this kind of goes back to some of the other things we talked about you talked about baby proofing so my wife wanted me to build like a bench that goes over our the fireplace I can't think what it's called right now the not the mantle but the part below right can't think of the name but you know to go over that to that way but because it's open stone and we want to make sure that our son's safe and everything like that right so I I drew out a plan I did the measurements you know I have the structure I have this in my head and then I you know I go to the store and I buy the wood and I and I build it and it was the first time I had ever upholstered anything you know so I did all that I put the foam on I upholstered it and you know like it was it was this project that I was working towards and I had so much meaning towards it and it's like okay well partly you know that that project was so meaningful for me because it's like okay here I'm you know and being able to have that that that future often that I put together these goals that I put forth I'm like okay I'm serving my wife right like I'm serving her because one she wants more seating and she wants to protect our son like I'm serving my family because I'm protecting my son I'm helping my community because I'm you know creating more seating in our living room and we can invite people over and they can have seating here and I'm also fulfilling my hobby of building things and putting this structure together so you know I within the the material right you have the material object that I built that I you know like you can describe the futures but I know the gestalt I know the structure I know the flaws I know exactly how it's put together I know how it was why it holds up because I know every cross beam and everything like that I know the screws that went into it right I have that structural element within me and then I also write in the more the psychotechnology part of it like the you know going into the metaphysical I also you know found meaning in it because of how it was nested within you know like what I want you know it's nested within the things that are bringing me meaning okay so how does that relate to the math and the art right so well one like I think that there is a lot of math and there's a lot of art in that right like I did have to do and you know this is kind of rudimentary geometry geometry art sorry math that I was doing just measuring things out and whatnot but you know I think that there's an element there and then there's also the artistic element of it right and so if I'm gonna take a stab at it I will say that the artist right they they they don't like the artist who is creating the picture they're not just seeing the features right they they know the structure they know what went into it they know every they know every brushstroke they know every mistake they know why that little you know oh let's buy that pretty bird is there because of that mistake that they made or whatever right like they have the they have that structure and it's that going from the feature to the structure into the you know to whether you're just even talking about the the material right the material structure or you're talking about what other kind of deeper meanings are behind the picture you know what does this image represents you know but it's it's going between those different those different levels of abstraction or those different levels of I guess even just structure right and I've really enjoyed that word gestalt I've been saying it a lot so it's a fun word it's a fun word so okay and then you think well how how does math exactly come into this because I haven't talked about math enough right so for myself when I think about math and I think about it is a lot of that is a lot of taking a problem right so and I think about here you're gonna be introduced to quadratic formulas for the first time okay I don't know how much you remember of your math but I think that you said you at least know some algebra so that's good no I went all the way through calculus and different equations abstract algebra I did a lot of math in college oh yes I remember you saying you got to abstract algebra and said nope this isn't for me I'll do this I got the algebra and I was like this is for me so and okay and I'll get back to that because I thought I had just had so remind me to come back to abstract algebra but when I think about algebra okay just algebra in itself and you are introduced to a quadratic equation for the first time and you are told different ways to solve this okay well at the beginning you know you have some features and it's it's you know it's numbers and it's letters but it's like no those numbers and letters have structure those numbers and there is an underlying structure and if you're given a you know an equation you can find a solution to that equation okay so you have a solution that equation and now that you have that solution you have more structure and you kind of understand this equation more because there's more meaning to that equation it's not there's no solution it's like oh no it maybe has one solution or has two solutions or you know it does have no solutions but you're getting more of the structure of this equation this quadratic equation okay and then as you find out more quadratic formulas and you solve more quadratic formulas you know you there is this point of abstraction where you say okay how do I solve at quadratic formulas in general what is the you know like how do I abstract this problem to a formula and that you know so for instance the quadratic formula that's what it's called right so here's the formula that you can use to then solve these problems right like this is the overarching formula that solves these problems and I think that a math has a lot of that right so and that's how often you'll teach math so when you teach about the Pythagorean theorem you give you don't say here's the Pythagorean theorem at least you shouldn't right you say here is triangles here is this measurement here's this measurement here's this measurement let's look at these measurements squared and you know let's try to abstract out a pattern right so you're going from features you're going from this you know like the lower level features to okay I'm going to abstract I'm going to figure out what is the the higher structure how can I abstract this problem get to the stopped right how can I get to the quad you know the quadratic formula how can I get to a squared plus b squared equals c squared right like that is the the is holding all of these these right triangles you know that they all share right and then when you talk about abstract algebra then you're not just talking about numbers and you're not just talking about formulas but it's okay well why you know where I guess you know you're abstracting even further and it's you know it's been long enough that I I can't make it good enough you know can't talk through a good enough example but you know that's really what it is right you're continually kind of abstracting back and back to where now you're not just solving this one math problem you can solve any of those problems you know like any of those problems if you know the overarching structure you can solve all the problems and then you just you know you keep that checking up so I that for me is I would say where that's where I see that's where I see this connection between why are people in math really like you know being drawn to the videos why are people who are art being drawn to the videos and you know because that's what Peterson did for me he took these features he took these stories he took you know these Disney stories and you know these heroes journey and whatever and it okay let's step it up and let's let's go to this other point of abstraction let's look at where is the where you know let's look at the archetypes and how do these archetypes manifest in other places and how are we solving not just you know the problem of the snake but we're you know the one snake problem but we're solving the problem of snakes right where we're going to this bigger how are we solving these bigger problems and so I guess for Vicky really helped me to see that connection by looking at again the features and the gestalt and how are we abstracting up and I know he talks about opacity and transparency within that as well right but I've more of so been focused in that aspect but that's my stab at it I don't know you can tell me what to do with my videos I mean it's an honest question I yeah people kind of chuckle when I say because I don't mean to disrespect my audience but I there are many times when I honestly don't know why I'll make a video and I'll think I shouldn't but but I like I just spent two hours making I don't want to delete it that'd be a waste of two hours I'll throw it out there and and I'll give it a crappy thumbnail and I won't give it a good title and maybe folks won't watch them I still listen to them all so but but see the fact that artists and and you know I really like what you just said in terms of Peterson I think that's I think that's really helpful but I don't find a whole lot of math or art in my videos and yet not artists talk to me just because I can they can talk to me they can't talk to Peterson I mean that's part of it I know but I don't know So okay I'm gonna say I'm you know again I'm just gonna take some stabs at this and people can tell me I'm wrong if I if I am but I'm gonna say that you're getting too focused on the feature that you're saying okay math and art like what's going on I don't talk about math I don't talk about art yeah but that idea that you know like what people who are very you know for myself in that are very fine I like math I don't know how to say better I like math and you know I do like art and I like you know solving equations and I do like creating art you know it's more about I guess that I'm taking it to a different level of abstraction where I just that idea of abstracting and I like that I like going from the features to the abstract and back I like looking at the patterns let's say and looking at the particulars yes yes and I think that that you know so okay so why do I listen to your videos why am I you know like why do I you even went you even went as far as to want to talk to me so yeah so I think you know part of it is that you know like why I and actually I really enjoy listening to these conversations and I guess that's why I wanted to put my you know my two cents it's great you don't find it boring at all see the boring part that's part that's part James's problem and he probably won't listen to this so I can say that so yeah so I think that you know I like seeing the patterns of people's journey I like like you know abstracting out what is what is common across these people who are in his channel besides you know Colts and you know whatever else I do yeah and art I enjoy trying to map out because I know myself I was you know brought into this and I guess part of it is trying to understand myself more and you know what can I glean from these other people and you know what what their journeys are so you know I think I think that's part of it and I think that what you're doing in your videos you know when I listen to them is you're helping me you know for instance I really like your rough draft for Sundays as well you know that's something I'd like to listen to quite a bit but you know I think for me you're helping me to I guess define the you know you're helping me to fill in the missing gaps that I have right and then sometimes no because sometimes I listen to some of your conversations or listen some things are saying I'm like I didn't get any of that you know but it does it's helping me to connect between Peterson and you know the narrative that I'm trying to embody the Christian narrative that I'm trying to embody and it's helping me to you know fall more into that narrative and to live out that more and to to see these connections and to him I'm having a hard time you know talking about it in a way that I wish I could be more specific about but you know I think that's really it like it's helping me to map out this more abstract realm that I just had never taken part in before right the philosophical the psychological the theological realm that I just you know for most of my life I was very material and just going with the culture like I said so you know helping to and it's like okay so and how is that helping me because one I mean I think it just it helps to fill in that gap of why why am I why am I doing these things and you know why am I interested and you know why did Peterson have such an effect on me and and why you know why do I feel I'm being so drawn into Christianity and that I want to you know keep living out that narrative so yeah it's been very helpful now. Well I think patterns you know and and I you know you're actually you talking about this has kind of helped me understand mathematicians a little bit better and and and part of what motivates us to math because because it is an abstraction and but it's a but it's an it's a patterned abstraction and so if if we can if we can if we can identify and know the pattern over here and we can see some of the underlying patterns and this does get into Gestalt so I get to say it too which is fun it is a fun word I like saying Gestalt so it sounds so European when I say Gestalt but if you recognize the Gestalt then you can begin to play with it and say this and maybe you know theme and variation and with math it's like it's you know here's the pattern and it's enormously powerful because it's predictive and so my my my second son is an engineer and that's you know the power of applied math that you can say this bridge will hold this he's working in a he's actually working in a wastewater treatment plant the major upgrade to this the city wastewater this the cement that has been cured this way you know will be good for these years that's a powerful powerful thing to in a sense reach into the future and there's all kinds of things built into it of course but that's that's a powerful powerful thing and perhaps some of what I'm doing is looking at patterns in life and and saying because some of these patterns that Peterson and Verbeke are talking about are some of the most important patterns in in life and part of what is in all defensive pastors and philosophers and theologians life is really complex and it's more complex than a bridge or a a container in a wastewater treatment plant that's a pretty complex thing yeah but life as there's so many variables and there's so it's it's such a dynamic environment so so the bridges the crosses that you bear you know sometimes bridges fail yeah yeah just built by engineers yep yeah it's very true so we got a few more minutes if you got anything else on your list you really want to get in um so I'm just gonna kind of go through because I want to make sure if it is something that it's something I really want to talk about I guess you know one thing that I do want to throw out just real quick is just how helpful you know Peterson was for me and in being able to become the person that I am right becoming and you know I think and I listen to his stories I hear him get choked up and I'm like yes like I'm there like I'm that person yeah like how helpful it was and and just how you know you have been as well and I guess to go back to because I did say I wanted to come back to something here is this idea of and just you know something that I want to promote I guess as myself and as a teacher is this idea of the family and just this family structure and keeping you know and what Peterson talks about in that video that I said I constantly go back to that you know you know I'm not leaving you no matter what and how important that is and thinking about you know all the way back to the beginning of our conversation when I was saying you know the boy that's at the the train tracks and he is trying to make that decision of who he needs to go with and you know I think for a long time I really I let you know because you know just I'm to full disclosure right you know with my parents having you know being divorced and then having to make tough decisions and then I need them you know I feel making a decision that wasn't a good one but you know and looking at myself as that child but again you can't look at yourself as the child right like it was a child that was put in an impossible decision that they had to make and you know so looking back at it now I have to look at it as an adult right I have to look at it as like I shouldn't have been put in that position but you know I mean my sister made a decision to run away we actually ran away from my mom's house all the way we ran all the way to Montana and we went to go live with my dad and wow and it was it was a very you know we got there and we were promised you know the the benevolent king you know so this is again where I say Peterson was very helpful because it just putting a narrative to it putting a structure to it and being able to to use that to find my way out right it was very very helpful so you know I was promised a benevolent king but we got the tyranny right and like my there was a lot of drug use there was you know my brother was on drugs and those things and it was just not a good scenario it was a it was a it was not a good scenario in the way that you know I kind of I've everything kind of defragmented right I went into the chaos I went into the void it was you know how I described it for myself you know and so moving forward as an adult and moving forward from there you know like I don't need to give you all the details but I just want to kind of stay with this overlying narrative you know as an adult it was how can I get out of this and I guess I wanted myself to be that child and that's where I you know the Peter Pan really comes in there was this this really big attractiveness you know like I like the Peter Pan like that I wanted to I wanted to be Peter Pan you know I wanted to you know like and that's where I guess you know why I want to talk about it in the beginning because it was a yeah you know I I didn't want to have to live out an air and I guess I wanted to see myself as a victim you know and so that's where else to kind of get into this you know when I Peterson talks about don't be a victim and those kinds of things and it's so that really was impactful for me as well and so and I guess one of the things that I really wanted to touch on because I wanted to challenge one of Peterson's ideas if I can because he talks about Jonah and he talks about Jonah in the whale and just you know Jonah he didn't want to go there because he just didn't want to go to that city because that was a hard task but really like the what the story you know because our pastor went over this was no Jonah didn't want to go there because he didn't want to save those people and that was what was really you know I didn't want to save my dad I didn't want to save him from the belly of the whale I didn't want to you know forgive him I didn't you know so that was you know a lot more of what it was for me and I just being able to to go down there and find him and find my dad and find you know all psychological absolutely but and forgive him and forgive myself for you know making that decision even though I was a kid and you know being able to I guess you know kind of come out of that and to rediscover who my dad was and to build this new relationship with him and to you know I love what I've been listening to for baking this idea of a copy right and you know that that forgiveness that I'm you know loving my dad out of the person who I thought he was or who you know I experienced into the person that I know he can be and the person that he is becoming and you know I've just built this relationship with him that I don't know like I don't think I would have ever been able to without you know listening to Peterson Moore and you know having that narrative structure to be able to I had to go there so yeah it was it was very powerful for me so I that's that's my last little bit I want to share and I hope that kind of ties everything together it really does well it really does and it makes it makes your it makes the decisions that you've made of a commitment to a woman and to a child and to a career and to a church it makes it all the more courageous because many people who have who have suffered what you've suffered have avoided and they have played Peter Pan and Mr. Nobody and they haven't chosen and and you when I was in when I was in I remember when I was in seminary a a theologian named Louis Meads he eventually taught at Calvin College for a while went on to teach at Fuller Seminary he came back to Calvin Seminary and he wrote a he wrote a little it did some lectures the style lectures on commitment and those were those were incredibly important in my life because they really challenged me to make that commitment to make that choice to take that goal and to define my future by that goal and no you're the last filling in of your story a bit really does help flesh out the whole conversation because now I can much more clearly see what I can far better understand the temptation to avoid and evade which is which is exactly what many people who have who have lived through some of what you've lived through have done because it feels safer but that safety is a losery because it is in the it is in the it is in the avoiding to choose that you actually don't you're not going to find meaning because you're not setting that goal the process of selecting a goal is a process of choice and and that's Peterson has a lot of different elements in him but one of the elements that sometimes gets forgotten is this is his existentialism and and existentialists are about you know taking that you know define you know defining themselves by their choices and and that's deeply important so yeah no and you're right about Jonah in the whale because the and if Peterson you know if he he's brought a lot of fresh things out of the Bible with his biblical series but there's a lot he misses simply because he doesn't he hasn't been able to avail himself of the rich tradition and and the story of Jonah and it's plain in the text he if you read all four chapters and not just one or two he he wants to judge he wants Nineveh to go down in flames and he knows that that God will save them he knows that you know God has that power and that he's going that if he goes there then you know like that it's they're going to be saved but he doesn't want him that's right he is he is his complaint unlike many people today who say oh the God of the Bible is too cruel Jonah looked at God and said no he's too merciful the world would be better if he you know if he would show more stick and there's a lot of people actually who very much believe that their anger with God is because God was negligent and it betrays and illuminates a lot of how they believe what they believe people are and how they believe people must be treated and it's a pretty dark vision so oh this has been good so I'm really glad I'm really glad that you reached out and I just you know I just didn't know if I'd have enough to bring or like I you know I just didn't know how much I'd be able to add to the conversation but as I kind of thought about it more it's like this is it's not more about you know that I don't know I just I wanted to embody it right I wanted to be a part of the conversation I wanted to you know it's a join in and to yeah to have that conversation so I just I finally got over that good for you good for you and again it's it's choosing it's taking and that's another thing that's good from Peterson I'll got it a good advice he's given is do something you know act don't sit here and spin act commit decide pursue and there's there is you know the old adage you know history favors the bold and so good for you for reaching out and scheduling and and good for you for committing to a wife committing to a church having a child and I I believe that your your choices will bless you even if they're hard as you go into the future so good for you well thank you Lee I will send you this video and you know you can decide if you'd be willing to let me share it I'm happy to have you share it I want I want people to see you in here and yeah so okay real good thank you yeah thank you yep bye bye
