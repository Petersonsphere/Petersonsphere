 Hi, this is Paul. This is Rough Draft for Sunday. Every week I work that I'm working on my sermon. I run through it on Friday, and I take a little video of it and video of it and I get feedback from you all in the comment section and This week is no different. We'll have another one next week, and then I'll be on vacation for a week, so You're gonna miss your gonna miss a whole bunch of videos that week probably who knows Haven't decided what I'm doing for vacation yet I had a strange thing at Living Stones last week David and Alexander were in the house from rebel wisdom and I noted that to some people on my congregation on Facebook and pointed them to the video the blog video that they made this week and I think probably some of them were a little surprised at the kinds of things these guys talk about These these aren't normal topics psychedelics and Meditation and these aren't normal topics for for a Living Stones Christian Reformed Church But they were in to to take some video and talk about Jordan Peterson of all things which is of course for many people in my church don't pay Hardly any attention to Jordan Peterson But this whole strange trip that I've been on for the last number of months has brought me a lot of new friends one of These new friends is Matt and Matt had a conversation with Jordan Peterson exploring Christianity and so part of what's strange for Christians who live inside their insular church bubbles is why are all these people interested in Christianity? And what does Jordan Peterson have to do with it Jordan Peterson doesn't go to church and his his relationship with Christianity is complex to say the least But here my friend Matt had a conversation with Jordan Peterson and the conversation was quite interesting because my friend Matt has a Seminary degree and he's been a youth pastor in some churches and he currently teaches math But he and Jordan Peterson got into it on Christianity, and I don't mean in a conflicted way Peterson was very interested and looking to ask Matt questions and As is often the case in Conversations that I have questions boiled down to brass tacks and this and for many people is this kind of the bottom question If being disobedient can get you lost Can working the rules get you saved now? I want to be a little careful with that word saved because a lot of church people will hear us here Saved as going to heaven and not hell when they die But actually that's a fairly low resolution view of the word if you look at the word in the Bible It's used for all kinds of things We need to be every saved in every way We can be saved to rip off a phrase from the the movie Titanic But the question is what what does it take what matters is it our works is it what something that God does? Is this something achievable is it something we can believe in? If God can judge us for our failings shouldn't he also reward us for our triumphs that would seem fair Do we really need God or can we rescue ourselves from our messes now often if we have a mess? That is common to us we Get ourselves out of it if we can often when people come to church with prayer requests They run into something too big and the doctor can't help them or the accountant can't help them or their parents Can't help them or their spouse can't help them or their children can't help them And there's no help to be found and so then they look for a church or a pastor or a friend and they ask God for help But that that always boils down to this question Is this something that we do or is this something that God does and if God? expects us to be good shouldn't we be able to be good and if we're not able to be good then What hope do we have now a lot of people say well? we'll look in the Bible for this answer and the default ways that people imagine the Bible works is that you look for an Answer to a question kind of like the magic eight ball well the Bible doesn't always work that way because the the people who wrote the Bible Didn't necessarily answer questions the kinds of questions We might bring to it and this Bible is this huge book and sometimes you find answers for direct questions In the Bible, and you don't like the answer so then you go looking for another answer Now in our in our Sunday sermons We've been going through the rise and the fall of the Israelite kingdom, and this is in some ways Supposed to be paradigmatic of the human condition Israel wanted to have a king just like all the other nations and then they had Saul that didn't work out so well And then they had David and David worked out very well and David's son Solomon in many ways became the paradigmatic king but then even Solomon was corrupted and the book of Kings is really about the fall of the kingdom of the kingdoms of the Israelites because of course they were one kingdom, and then they split into two and As always the Bible project has some terrific YouTube videos that give summaries of some of the books in the Bible if you've never read them and are curious about them But we're picking up the story and second King 17 and the 12th year of King Ahaz king of Judah That's the way they told time back then it was a certain number of years of a particular king of a nation Hoshi a son of Elah became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned nine years He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, but not like the kings of Israel who preceded him hmm Shalman Asur king of Assyria Which is a very big empire and rising empire at the moment came up to attack Hoshi. Ah who had been shall shall must Shalman Yes Shalman Esser's vassal and had paid him tribute But the king of Assyria discovered that Hoshi was a traitor for he had sent envoys to sow King of Egypt and he no longer paid tribute to the king of Assyria as he had done year by year therefore Shalman Asur Seized him and put him in prison and the king of Assyria Invaded the entire land and marched against Samaria and laid siege to it for three years in the ninth year of Hoshi Ah the king of Assyria captured Samaria and deported the Israelites to Assyria He settled them in Halah and goes on on the Haber River and then the towns of the Meads Now what was happening was that Assyria had decided to take their imperial Their imperial cause to a whole new level previously they had been satisfied just raiding these kingdoms between Assyria and Egypt But now they were ready to take permanent conquest they wanted to take these lands and settle in and carve up the lands into Assyrian districts now what this meant though was Assyria had to practice its form of assimilation What this effectively meant was the end of the northern kingdom of Israel and sometimes people talk about the lost tribes of Israel and the and so what happened is probably the elites were Were carted off the people of wealth and importance the people who could potentially have organized a threat against the Assyrian Empire and they were so the Assyrians came down to stay and they moved in other Displaced and conquered peoples of the Empire into the land of Israel. This is how Assyria managed both its refugee problem and its potential rebellion problem But now what the king of the book of Kings does is they just have this short almost matter-of-fact description of how the northern kingdom is Destroyed and then it launches off into a sermon All of this took place because the Israelites had sinned against the Lord their God who brought them out of Egypt from under the power Of Pharaoh the king of Egypt They worshipped other gods and followed the practices of the nations The Lord had driven out before them as well as the practices that the kings of Israel had introduced The Israelites secretly did things against the Lord their God that were not right from watchtower to fortified city They built themselves high places in all their towns These high places were places that people could kind of freelance their religion They set up sacred stones and ashara poles on every high hill and under every spreading tree This is the way that the book talks about the people were tremendously religious. They worked a religious of pragmatism They were looking for spiritual solutions for their physical problems At every high place they burned incense as the nations whom the Lord had driven out before them had done They did wicked things that aroused the Lord's anger they worshipped idols though Though the Lord had said you shall not do this The Lord warned Israel and Judah through all his prophets and seers turned from your evil ways Observe my commands and decrees in accordance with the entire law I commanded your ancestors to obey and that I and that I delivered you and I delivered to you through my servants the Prophets but they would not listen and they were stiff-necked as their ancestors who did not trust in the Lord their God They rejected his decrees and the covenant he had made with them Ancestors and the statutes he had warned them to keep they followed worthless idols and themselves became worthless They imitated the nations around them. Although the Lord had ordered them do not do as they do They forsook all the commands of the Lord their God and made themselves two idols cast in the shape of calves and an ashara Pole they bowed down to all the starry hosts and they worshipped bail they sacrificed their sons and daughters in the fire They practiced divination and sought omens and sold themselves to do evil in the eyes of the Lord Arousing his anger so the Lord was very angry at Israel and removed them from his presence Only the tribe of Judah was left and even Judah did not keep the commands of the Lord their God They followed the practices of Israel that Israel had introduced Therefore the Lord rejected all the people of Israel and he afflicted them and gave them into the hands of plunderers Until he thrust them from his presence then he tore Israel away from the house of David They made Jeroboam son of Nabat their king Jeroboam enticed Israel away from following the Lord and caused them to commit a great sin the Israelites Israelites persisted in all the sins of Jeroboam and did not turn away from them until the Lord removed them from his presence As he had warned them through all of his servants the prophets So the people of Israel were taken away from their homeland in exile in Assyria where they still are Where they are still? Now if you listen to Sam Harris and many others they'll say well These are these are made-up stories by an old man in the sky and this is just people this is just religious Revisionists going back and adding a religious veneer to what had happened to Israel Well The book of Kings doesn't see it that way when he took Israel out of out from the house of David They made Jeroboam son of Nabat their king Jeroboam enticed Israel away from following the Lord and committed a great sin The Israelites persisted in all the sins of Jeroboam and did not turn away from them until the Lord removed them from his presence He had warned through all his servants the prophets so the people So the people see yeah, that's why I do rough drafts that was a repeat of a slide gotta pause I thought that that transition didn't go very well. I didn't actually hit the Good slide. I just went the wrong wrong direction. So I did some editing So the common take is that these made-up stories of a sky god and they're used to perpetuate ancient stories that irrationally control people in order to keep men in power just man or other man or these whatever And then there's this the assumption of common religion behind it If you do good God will reward you if you do evil God will punish you But when you roll out with that you start getting specific about what is good and evil Well how to know the rules different gods have different rules and and this God of Israel seems less Reasonable than other gods who are okay with people freelancing their spiritual portfolio and cutting the best ears with religious service providers and And so often when text like this gets read it's like well, of course no no real God should have a Should have a problem with what we would imagine to be reasonable conduct And so therefore all of this stuff about is real light particularity just looks bad But I wanted when I read this passage I had another question when did Israel stop being Israel So they have their particular God and they have their particular Identity and they have their particular story about what this God is demanding of them And you might have noticed in the text that the story goes all the way back to Egypt It seems this God imagines that He created Israel that they don't exist on their own and that he lays claims on them So what was it that made them special their devotion to this to their particular God and his strange demands that permeated all of life It seemed just about everybody in the region had had kind of common religious practice But these Israelites had strange notions from this jealous God now if you read the book of Kings basic the basic assumption of the book of Kings is that This is Israel becoming like her neighbors slowly surely The corruption of the neighbor sets in at least it's perceived as corruption by the book of Kings Now we might begin to ask ourselves So what exactly is lost when Israel becomes like all the other neighbors? She has the same God the bail Asherah poles the same behaviors which is kiss up and kick down the same goals of being the top dog and so the Destruction of Samaria and the assimilation by Assyria. Is this such a bad thing? Now What happens essentially is that Israel goes into the Assyrian blender and becomes these so-called lost tribes and In some ways it's the fulfillment of first Samuel 8 where they not only have a king like the other nations They have the same king as the other nations And so the Israelites are shuttled out into some different places and people from other places are shuttled in aren't people people Isn't this just the way of the world and so what is the book of Kings? Complaining about and what is this God of Israel complaining about what does it have to do with anything and her mission? Now Implicit in this is if Israel wanted to keep her identity if he is Israel wanted to keep her peculiar ways about her Would the outcome have been different if she had stayed obedient now? There's always two ways to talk about Rules one one way of talking about think I'll do a slide on this so hang on I'm gonna add a slide Now there's there's always there are always two Kinds of rules or even perhaps two aspects of rules there are rules with natural Consequences that seem inherent in the situation and there are rules with external Consequences where a third party comes in and acts to enforce a rule now now these two views Or aspects of rules are not necessarily exclusive Sometimes they are and sometimes they aren't and you might think about let's say a mother tells a child don't touch the stove the mother is then the external force of consequence and Slaps the hand the child touches the stove and is burned that would be the natural consequence One of the one of the things that's going on here with Israel is The natural consequence of not following the Covenant makes her just like the other nations Wonder where I should put this slide hang on. I'm gonna move my slides around And so if you understand these two aspects you could ask this question when did Israel stop being Israel Now clearly the book of Kings see this as an external consequence But it's can just as easily be viewed as a natural consequence Israel according to the book of Kings was following the practice of The local bales of the regional gods and was simply assimilated into the practice of all the other kings They have the same gods the same Behaviors the same goals and so they are lost essentially. They are self lost They lost themselves and they lost themselves by simply giving up on the project simply Choosing the project and in that sense God gives them exactly what they've always wanted except Maybe they didn't like these particular circumstances, but were these particular circumstances different than what they had before Now that then begs the question of of God's power if God would rescue them Would the outcome had been different if they'd been obedient? So let's imagine that perhaps they were obedient would God have rescued them and certainly the book of Kings is full of lots Of stories about God rescuing them or God rescuing his prophet and and we've seen that in past sermons now part of us wants to say yes because this sounds Will the outcome have been different if they had been obedient part of us definitely wants to say yes because This is exactly the kind of contractual arrangement We want to make with God that if we're God or the gods or the universe or however you want to frame it That if I do good then good things will happen and if I do bad then bad things will happen if I eat right then I'll What live forever if I if I eat right and take care of myself and do good to my neighbor Then my neighbor will do good to me now doing bad to your neighbor can pretty much ensure that your neighbor will likely do bad To you, but if you do good to your neighbor your neighbor still might do bad to you, but This this sounds fair and and in many ways if you read the book of Deuteronomy Where a lot of this stuff gets laid out pretty clearly that's pretty much what God says if you do right by me, then I will bless you and Then your then your crops will grow and you'll have plenty of children and you'll flourish in the land so on and so forth But now let's imagine every time we run this experiment with people the outcome always stays the same now If you know anything about people this might not be a mystery because it is very much the case that if you're good to your neighbor your neighbor might not be good to you and Generally speaking it's not at all unusual to have a relationship with someone and both parties think that they've been good to the other party or just to the other party or Fair to the other party or even even generous towards the other party the other party doesn't feel the same way There's human biases involved. There's all kinds of things involved But here's the thing Performances performance can vary but people are never perfect every time you run this experiment with people The experiment always seems to go the same way So let's continue the thought of the experiment and let's imagine what if there was a perfect man Now he'd need to be perfect in his words and his deeds and if such a man lived How would he be received now actually I could? I'm gonna make a little make a little comment in here that I'd About a year or so ago I read Plato's Republic and one of the interesting early conversations in Plato's Republic is about the just man and Plato makes the observation that the the truly just man would actually be considered Unjust by his neighbors because of the just man is celebrated for his justice well, then he has an he has an internal reward for the justice and someone who Adjust man who is punished as if he were unjust is actually more just than that man because He would obviously be just despite the reward instead of just because the reward and again the book of Job Goes into some of these different ancient con conversations But the perfect man would need to be perfect in his words and deeds and even when he would be imagined to be Imperfect by the people around if such a man lived, how would he be received? Well, would they make him king or? Would they welcome him and appreciate him and again Plato starts to look at this and we think well Maybe maybe not and and you might in fact remember back in your school days If you had a group of kids who were intent on doing something intent on doing wrong How did you feel about the one kid who didn't want to go along with the wrong that you wanted to do in fact? We as human beings are in fact so groupish We will hate someone just because they haven't assimilated into our group whether or not we think that they are doing right or wrong so Let's also imagine the first century Judean and Judean culture war the Romans and the Greeks thought the Jews were ignorant and backward people and when they came and Conquered them just like the Assyrians or the Babylonians They would come into the land and say well surely our gods are better and surely our civilization is better and surely we know How to live because we have all the best We have all the best religion and we have all the best ideas and you backwards people Your ideas are backwards because of course you have this tiny little You have this tiny little group of people who aren't conquering anyone and the whole world is flocking to us because we surely know the way To live so they had in many ways the Greek man's burden to civilize them with theater and art and the Roman way of success Now the Jews didn't see it this way they hated what they thought was cultural Genocide and religious corruption and did what they could to resist including violence now What if the perfect man came into such a situation? What would this world make of him? Now despite all of the laudatory Messages we hear about Jesus even some of those people who who don't believe that Jesus was God even Russell Brand who who loves Jesus, but doesn't like the rest of the New Testament Well, what does the record show? Well all parties hated despised and looked down on the others and the one thing they could come to agreement on Was that in their opinion the world would be better without Jesus in it and so they killed him Well, what does this do to our perfect man experiment Well, it says that if you had a perfect man and in fact the New Testament connects Jesus to Israel The rest of the world wouldn't tolerate him. In other words the wages of sin is death but the wages of perfection is Death and probably an early one Well, is that a statement about perfection or is that a statement about us and the way we run this world Now we all know that doing evil can get you lost But what does obedience get you? Well obedience to what pilot asks? What is truth? Obedience will get you dead Hated by the perpetual warring factions of the human race I should make that clear or otherwise I could stand on the pulpit and Forget exactly the point I was trying to make Perfection and obedience will in fact to get you dead Hated by the perpetual warring factions of the human race now depending on the the society it might come sooner or later But this is pretty much how this world works Now what if there is a God who judges rightly and vindicates? What would he do with such a person? Raise him vindicate him raise him up to the highest place last week We read the beginning verses of Philippians 2 they're very much germane to this But what if I can't do it see here's the problem with perfection I've long since blown it and I've made choices in my life that by any Standard would be sinful Now you might say yeah pastor, but what about the rules aren't the rules all different? Well, let me let me give you about the easiest way I can talk about the rules imagine there's an app on your smartphone that every time you laid a burden on someone else Well, he should do this. Well, she should do that. Well, they shouldn't do this. Well, they shouldn't do that They shouldn't lie cheat or steal or do anything bad What if at the end of your life a Divine judge came to you and read off the app and said I'm not gonna hold you to any standard Other than that what you have put on other people. I Know I would fail that standard You can decide for yourself whether you think you would rise to that standard whether you held that standard perfectly Well, no God should hold people to any any perfect standard. What standard would you have him hold? the people to I've made messes in my life that I can't clean up and often I need to be forgiven Not just from a god but from other people Truth is I'm a bad bet. I'm a lot like the northern kingdom because what so often I want to do is just simply fit in I would rather fit in Than be just and true and perfect and holy and I don't think I'm so much different from the rest of the world What if you could be united with this perfect man Well, how well what kind of unity would we be talking about? How about by baptism? You can read about that in Romans 6. What if there were a situation where? The perfection of this man is if his goodness was so good It could be given to me or I could be judged By the standard he attained rather than the performance that I have failed It would have to be a gift because I couldn't buy it because of my corruption Well, if you can understand this you can understand the gospel Now having received this gift, how should you live well Why don't you live out of the grace that was shown to you? Why don't you see the beauty of this man? And if you actually see the beauty of this man, you will probably Want to live up to this man Just some editing on this slide. There's a funny dynamic that happens When someone impresses us by their excellence by their virtue by the clarity of their thought by The manner in which they live we naturally aspire to emulate that we recognize that we fall short In fact being next to them reminds us of how the ways we fall short But even in that situation that distance draws us to them This is the natural admiration of a hero so if in fact you could imagine that perfect man and if in fact that perfect man actually lived and if in fact That perfect man was actually killed Not for his sins, but for his perfection and if in fact there is a God That saw this and because of that vindicated him by his resurrection and exalted him to the highest place And if you believe any of this, how then should you live you should live out of gratitude You should live out live out of natural admiration for a hero This might be something that you can identify with because you've probably had heroes in your life It could be a parent or it could be a teacher or it could be a public figure and you see the Excellency of their life and you want to live up to them. And so that's how you live Well, what would that involve you live out of the grace that was shown to you? You know the distance between you of them and them so every time you fall short You ask for forgiveness of your hero and what if your hero can listen to you and what if you have a personal relationship? with that hero You act out towards you acted out towards rebellious and broken people because you were the schmuck that that hero rescued and you were undeserving and You are undeserving of the great cost that he expended on your behalf So you try to live out the perfection you cannot attain and in fact to the degree to which you move closer to him Even the ways you fall short in the midst of pursuing that beloved that beautiful hero that figure That you that becomes the center of your world Becomes joy into joy. Well, sure there are moments where you fall short But what kind of hero are you following? You're following a hero that knows your weaknesses. You're following a hero that understands You're following a hero that encourages you to live up to his life and promises you That you will share in his reward and you will never be separated from him at all Romans 8 that is the Christian life Don't you want to live it?
