 Hi, this is Paul. I want to do a video on the relationship between the problem of evil and unbelief I'm gonna use this piece because it just posted in the New York Times and that one person saw it on my blog and so I'm not gonna read that probably because of their own political persuasion or perhaps who the author was Because I'm now posting my conversation Details on my blog. I want people to understand something about my blog, which is that if I post something on my blog I'm not promoting it. I just post things on my blog so that I can find them later It's always been sort of a filing cabinet for me things that I find interesting. I might agree with it I might disagree with it I most often post things with absolutely no comment because I'm just putting it there so I could find it But anyway, the New York Times had a piece by a George Yancey from Emory University that was entitled dear God, are you there and it was Yeah, I got posted on a bulletin board that I participated in that is mostly political left This letter was was prompted by 22 precious lives taken in El Paso in August 3 2019 by a 21 year old white supremacist gunman. That's always important when you read When you read these articles that they're always shaped by it's all the little adjectives that tell you sort of okay What's the real message of this in terms of what's the moral posturing of it? He told investigators that he wanted to kill many Mexicans as possible. Now. I made this point on Twitter a number of times Mexican is not a race Mexican is a nationality This person might be an ethno nationalist. That's that's probably a little little more accurate description if he's trying to preserve Americans for Americans But just like Americans has no race and if you say that the word Americans does have a race You're actually being a racist and an ethno nationalist to say that Mexican is a race when in fact Mexico is an ethnically diverse country And if you've had much experience in Latin America much of Latin America is in our ethnically diverse Countries with their own sets of racial tensions and programming and conflicts to the degree that to to go into any country in the Americas and start making rather Facile connections between nationalities in particular races Usually is gets rather racist pretty quickly But anyway, that's my point in this is on in fact the problem of evil because he goes through that Okay, so there was a gunman and the gunman in El Paso and the gunman in Dayton and the president's tweets about you know stoking the flames of Stoking the flames of it's really nationalism and that you know keeping away Mexicans and immigration and the president doing all this tweeting and and racial device racial divisiveness that's going on and congresswomen of color and Now this is again from a polli Particular political posture and it's not my goal to comment On the politics of this as much as to say that what this is actually doing is stating that Well, these give this person doubt that there is a god Now again, there's a ton built into there Well, what do you think the job of god is if there is a god and this god acts as you imagine this god should act What do you imagine this god should do now one of the things i'm not doing is Calling into question the sincerity of people who make this claim The questions about the problem of evil are a pretty standard Remarked by many many people in terms of why they say they can't believe in a god in fact bart urman when he did a conversation with sam harris used this for all of the questions and challenges that bart urman has against His former Evan he used to be an evangelical when he was an evangelical his reading from evangelicalism of the new testament He's a new testament scholar He says none of that really made a difference in terms of his rejection of christianity And his denial of the existence of god it was in fact the problem of evil He said and if you watch nathan jacobs film about becoming fully human and as i've spoken with nathan jacobs about it Very regularly for the nuns those who now declare no religious affiliation or the duns those who are in a sense declared themselves as post christian the The problem of evil and the problem of suffering comes up again and again but Whereas people self identify this as a reason why they don't believe in god I really don't think it is. I think the picture is far broader far more complex Has to do with way more things than just the problem of evil I think the problem of evil has in some ways become a socially fashionable and sanctioned way of saying here's my justification for the very heavy cost of walking away from familial connections and Within a particular subculture the status that they had when they did declare they did believe in god Because the reason is that I think if the evils they identify were resolved They wouldn't start believing in god again That's my thesis here And I think a way to test that thesis is to take the political formulation of this piece in the new york times And say well, what would it take to resolve all of these things? So let's imagine a green moral police state the united states turning into a green moral police state The u.s. Seizes every non-governmental gun in the country. All right soldiers and policemen Go through houses searching houses. We're going to set aside We're going to set aside the bill of rights here for this Imaginative United states green moral police state they go through every house and they they take away every gun and they track them all down And whenever a gun appears or rumors of a gun, they're like nazi You know, they're like nazi ss and they go into houses looking for jews They get all the guns and so now when anybody wants to shoot up a place Well, they'll just have to take a knife or an axe or a well We'll talk about trucks and cars a little bit later They'll have to have some less effective way to try to kill a bunch of people for whatever whatever is motivating them Enforcement will have to be enormously draconian to be to be effective, but there'll be no more mass shooters. There'll be none of that People have to go back to killing themselves too with ropes and knives and and carbon Well, we'll talk about carbon dioxide. We'll talk about carbon monoxide in a minute Let's imagine in this green moral police state that donald trump and mike pence are impeached convicted and jailed Um, maybe the speaker of the house nancy pelosi is then installed may the republican party is made illegal and aoc now Occupies the right wing of the government Again, we're playing a little fantasy game here Imagine in this green moral police state that the green new deal plus is enacted and carbon Is ration carbon emissions are rationed just like gasoline was rationed in world war ii and air travel is reduced to only the Only the absolute essentials for the nation So we have these empty skies and no more planes spitting out co2 and far fewer cars spitting out co2 and if you want to and and coal plants will all be abolished and we'll start reducing the the The natural gas plants and I guess we'll have to go to nuclear and solar and wind and And everything will be green green green and the government's going to insist on this and I know in the comment section I mean Just play along with me here. This is a little game and yes, the economy would tank and blah blah blah That's not my point here. Okay, we're playing a little game Well, and you might say well, we got to deal with china and india Well, the green new deal plus is enacted worldwide the united states finally decides We're going to use our military might to make the rest of the world to save the rest of the world And so china india and africa and everyone is told to comply with our green new deal plus or face nuclear annihilation The justification will be well if we don't resolve the if we don't resolve this global climate issue within the next few years In 20 years, it's all going to be like a nuclear war anyway, so shoot Might maybe nuke a city or two and that'll show the world that we're serious and after that Everyone will comply. I don't know what to do with russia, but one way or another again. It's a it's a it's a It's a thought experiment here that i'm i'm pulling and and israel well because israel the palestinians get mentioned in this piece In the new york times. Well, well israelis are told to let the palestinians go and leave them alone or will nuke them too And the whole world then is is is in this green moral police state the whole world is subjugated by this particular view of what morality is Now free speech will be abolished. There'll be no hate speech or bigoted language tolerated by anyone You'll be jailed your children will rat you out for what you say in the house There'll be this will in fact be so effective that no protected class will ever have to hear an offensive word And we'll probably have to burn huck fin at least the novel If all of this were true Now you can reverse this into another political way You can just turn this all over and have your republican utopia or your libertarian utopia or what have you? Then would you believe in god? Well now you've got all the the local suffering the historical suffering the all of this stuff But but my point is you're you're It's not because of the suffering that I my doubt is that you're not believing in god because of all the suffering The disbelief is coming from other places Besides you noticing suffering in the world At least if you're living in north america from your air-conditioned first world living room In fact, it's many of the people who aren't suffering much at all who point to suffering suffering of other people For the reason that there is no god So what was behind the idea of saying that it was suffering in fact tim keller in this book notes that this This idea really only starts in the modern period and and it isn't that ancients didn't Deal with suffering and questions about god. It's right there in the book of joe one of the oldest books in all of human history You had an idea Behind your idea of god behind your idea of the whole god Relationship that God was some sort of father in the sky who made everything into sunflowers and ice cream But here's the truth. No amount of sunflowers and ice cream will actually make you believe in god Why well Look around if you take a look at chris arnade's book dignity Back row america the people who have a real lack of sunflowers and ice cream. They believe in god Who doesn't believe in god? Well, it tends to be the wealthy and the privileged and we're the people that don't believe in god Even though we're not suffering as much as the drug addicts and the prostitutes and all of those people that chris arnade talks about It's the wealthy secure affluent people who talk like this new york times piece. It's not the people who are actually suffering It's post-christian european civilizations in the group of in the grip of the meaning crisis and more things beyond that in fact your evidential case for suffering Leading to unbelief in god gets worse because all the disparaging comments you make about adjectives like that's a Biblical level of suffering or or their life was absolutely medieval Everyone back in those days believed in some sort of god The world was simply brimming with god and meaning and and everything the green moral state the green moral state wishes to banish So in fact the evidence all points to the other way They all believed in god and they suffered and they saw more suffering than just about anybody does sitting in their nice car Seeing that poor homeless mentally ill person at the corner with a sign saying that they're a vet Or something we see on the news This matrix is far more complicated than this Facile thing well, I can't believe in god because there's all this suffering and because these shoot these shootings god, where are you? I I don't buy it And and in fact, there's zero evidence that this felt cause is the real cause of unbelief again. I'm not saying people are insincere I'm just saying that there's two things and they're connecting them The real I think the more interesting question is why do we keep telling this story? And I think we do because it gives us sort of a moral superiority to god We blame for not enforcing whatever police state we imagine that's needed that god is somehow Both too tolerant and too negligent with this world to allow all this stuff and we don't sit and pause for a moment and imagine Well, let's imagine what it would take to banish all of this suffering to banish his absence I think that's offends us. I think this is actually kind of a subtle form of virtue signaling now I can go on for hours about this stuff and i've talked about it before and I don't want to make this video too long But even if you look at a little graphic, it's just brimming with with these axial ages things I've been reading c.s. Lewis's when I put it. Oh, here it is. I've been reading I read c.s. Lewis's the discarded image and What's fascinating about the discarded image is all of the the Ptolemaic Aristotelian medieval model where where the moon is the boundary line and here here's god way out there and I don't I just don't think the objection really finally Is the cause or or if you think it through long enough, which alvin plantiga has done in a tiny little book I got it over there. I didn't bring it over here But he wrote about this back in the 70s and he said this really isn't a philosophical objection It's a pastoral objection as the pastor i'm saying it's not even a coherent objection the deep moral crisis is that people are not what you um, What you like to imagine they are and that there's no remedy you would have to be happy with with All of our self-inflicted wounds In fact if you think through this and you think well what it would take what would it take to at least Maybe we can't dig into the hearts of of bigots and haters, but what would it take to at least banish all Exhibition of it and and force india and china and africa to not even if the united states and europe Greatly curbs their their co2 emissions. I mean, what would it take to fix up the world? And if you think that through You're probably going to realize Oh my goodness We're probably not going to fix this Now I think we were amazingly fortunate Speaking as a pastor probably be a divine providence to not to not have had a nuclear a massive nuclear exchange During the cold war that's a wonderful thing Are we going to get out of some of these other? Self-inflicted wounds and traps we're making for ourselves Not likely That's an oppressing thing to think well so Again, i've been reading i've been reading and listening to stuff on renee garrard and yeah, there's some scapegoat it could be some scapegoat activity going out here and the the the trump derangement factor of well donald trump is the Is the you know the sum of all of our? The some donald trump is the problem for all of this and of course before donald trump was the source of all of our calamities Well, it was barack obama for the other side and before it was barack obama. It was george w bush. In fact, the the the listserv that I participated and got started because george w bush was speaking at calvin college and a lot of professors and people Including my parents signed on to a petition that put an ad in the grand rapids press that said We don't want to see him there and I didn't want to see george w bush at at calvin college speaking for commencement He bumped nick nick walthersdorf who I thought was more deserving But who's going to bump the president and so on and so forth all that intramural stuff My point is just this we scapegoat and we we find reasons that Actually the reasons for belief That that sort of climb us up the moral hierarchy and it just sounds More moral than god to claim well I can't believe in god because of all the suffering in the world and if there was a god he would somehow fix it when truth be told We don't have the stomach to fix these things and For good reason So why do I believe in god well Maybe my reasons are just as self-serving as the reasons of unbelief. Maybe I gain status by saying I believe in god Well, you know these things tend to go back and forth Without god, I don't see much hope of rescue because things are pretty grim in a lot of ways There's so much pain Isn't in the new york times when I when I talk to people about as a pastor about The pain that they experience It's almost always common family pain and loss These things No Green moral police state will fix in fact They'd exacerbate a lot of them We can't imagine a way out So is this why I believe well, do you believe do you not believe what did you think of my? What do you do you claim you don't believe in god because of all the suffering in the world leave a comment leave a note So this is a little different topic than what i've done before every now and then I do something That's a little more political but my point really isn't political because I very much see politics as downstream from religion and people ask me about I'm not skeptical about religion, but I am skeptical about politics people like to Say they're skeptical about god. Well, i'm skeptical about politics. So let me know what you think in the comment
