 Welcome to the Freddie and Paul show, episode 26. How are you my friend? I'm doing fine. We're here back at Living Stones. We're going to talk a little bit about, we just got finished with church, talk a little bit about the sermon. We had Lazarus. By the way, you did a good job preaching man. Thank you Fred. It really was a good sermon and I learned a lot from it. I learned that John the Baptist was baptized by, no, Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist. That's right, that's right. And this week Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead. What are your thoughts on that? What do you think about that? Well, he died but his spirit was still alive. So he came back and his spirit was with Jesus, right? Or am I wrong? No, I'm kind of wrong. Those are all good questions Fred. Those are hard questions but good questions. I'm sorry. No, no, that's good. That's totally good. So then Jesus commanded Lazarus to come back out of the grave. Okay. And then they wanted to kill Jesus after that. Why do you think they wanted to kill Jesus after that? Because he went against their train of thought or their... No, that's true. That's true. They didn't do what he was asked to do maybe? Well, they were worried about him because they thought he was going to get very popular. Like John the Baptist did. Like John the Baptist. That's why they killed him. That's right. That's why they killed John the Baptist. That was not good. That was not good. And so then after he raised Lazarus from the dead they planned on killing Jesus. So that's what we talked about in the sermon today. Okay. So what else do you want to talk about? Well, I was pretty pleased even though they got rid of Demarcus Cousins. Oh, the kings. They got rid of Cas... Yeah, we're talking about the kings now. Talking about the kings. Hi, kings. How you doing? Anyways, they got rid of Demarcus Cousins. They got rid of Omri Casby. Now, Omri Casby plays for Memphis. I don't know how that happened. I don't know why. He was supposed to go to Minnesota and we got this guy named Heald. And then we got... Is he good? Heald is pretty good. Yeah, they played Timberwolves last night. I can't remember if they won or not, but it was real close. Okay, okay. So they came back and had a good game. So that was pretty cool. I'm waiting for football. San Francisco 49ers. Yeah. What do you think about the Raiders moving to Vegas? I don't like that. I think that's bogus. Hear, hear. Got a word from our studio audience here. So, Freddie's down on the Raiders moving to Vegas. No, no, I want them to be in the open. The Niners are still here. Yeah, we got the Niners. We got the quarterback from the Bears. Yes. Chicago Bears. I'm serious. Cutler? Yeah. Oh, I didn't know that. Yeah, he's going to play this year. Oh, okay. Well, good, good. He's a good quarterback. Okay, I'm going to do a rap about John the Baptist. Rap about John the Baptist. Here we go. Okay. John the Baptist was not falling. Jesus, now I'm on the mic every day and every weekend. You got to understand that Jesus is the man. He's in command, and that's for sure, my man. One, two, three. You know it's me, the big dog. They call Freddie D. Sacktown on the map until we go. Rocking on the mic, really, though. Good to go without a word to say. Jesus loves you. One love, really, though, okay? There wasn't a lot of John the Baptist in that rap. I know, I know. Okay. All right, so that's it for today. Freddie and I are going out to lunch tomorrow, so we might have another episode tomorrow. Yeah, let's just do one at ... No, we won't do one at the restaurant. We'll do it in the car. We'll do it in the car. All right, well, I enjoyed your thing. Okay. What else was I going to add? Gordon didn't make it, so we've got to get a hold of Gordon somehow. Okay, maybe. Anyway. Gordon hasn't been in any of our shows, but Gordon's a friend of ours. I faithfully came to church now for seven weeks, I think. Seven weeks in a row. Well, I haven't been more than that. I don't know. It's been a long time. But Freddie's been singing with the praise group. He's doing very good. We're awesome. He takes his hat off and his coat off and everything. Yeah, so okay. Okay. Thank you for tuning in. If you have any questions or any topics you would like, please let Paul know. We need topics.
