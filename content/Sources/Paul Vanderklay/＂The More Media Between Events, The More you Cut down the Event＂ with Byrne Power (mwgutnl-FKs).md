 Do I look a little better than usual? You do not genetically. You do you look good. It's did you get a camera? No I got a I upgraded my wi-fi to fiber optic. So uploads like when I do one of those massive three hour uploads it would take 10 hours. So now it'll take 20 minutes. Yes. So I'm cooking with grease. Now I just get the OBS thing working on my camera and I should look well I wouldn't want to say professional but you get the picture. I get the picture. Actually you look good the back is dark. You're yeah and I'll tell you I tell people who I do these conversations with I mean if you can get fiber get fiber because there's there's there's no going back once you go fiber you're done. It's well my DSL connection here was shall we say primitive. DSL is primitive. I had DSL back in then early aughts. Yes exactly. Yeah it's reminding me of Alaska during that time too. I think I left Alaska with DSL. We were pretty like proud of it. Well it was a big jump over dial-up. I remember that. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. So um how are you doing? I'm doing good. I'm doing good. Just had a little uh little plumbing thing at home and you just always have those kind of things. I mean plumbing never you know the day before the wife says oh that that that's that tub in the garage that sure was slow and then back of my mind I know okay I lived in this house 23 years this morning the kitchen sink was little was backing up I thought yeah so but yeah there are those uh there are those just physical things. I was talking with a friend uh yesterday. I have a uh pretty educated American friend staying at my house for a few months here and we're having some pretty interesting conversations and I'm slowly convincing him that he should start a YouTube channel because he has a lot to say but I'm not going to mention his name just because he's still incognito but uh we were talking and I and I just finally said you know ultimately so much of life is about the stuff the physical stuff we have to move around I mean you know I'm thinking of trying to get my library from Alaska to here it's just stuff walking up the hill huffing and puffing it's just gravity all this this this stuff. Yep. But my point that I was actually making with him was that a reality isn't the stuff. Yeah. Did I don't did you have a chance are we recording already? Yeah yeah yeah. Okay did you have a chance to listen to uh the Ruckmacher What is Reality? No no. You really should. I saw I saw you posted it but I haven't listened to it yet. Yeah it's already had 1200 hits which is pretty amazing for an old uh 45 year old recording um and such but uh I've been listening to uh your various not everything but enough to follow a lot of what you've been talking about and I've noticed that it's been about um you've been dealing a lot with you know the materialistic world versus you know the spiritual world you know what these kind of you know science versus religion and all of these kinds of things I thought uh I just had this thought if you're interested that I think some of my ideas on time might actually be apropos at this moment and uh these are like there's it's a long 10-part series but these things come along in the about the the second half or so. Okay. And um so you want me to just go ahead? Give me yeah go ahead give me a okay okay well I'm not going to uh in any you know I took it's 10 episodes so I'm not going to try to boil that down but I will say this I had this a lot of things came together in my reading and in my life and I had this moment where I remember walking down the street and just thinking to myself um it's almost like people don't live in time anymore it's like they live against time and then I thought to myself oh it's not almost as if it is in fact and what I realized is that we spend most of our lives involved in things these days that shortcut the process of time so whether it's travel or what we're doing here I mean for me to actually talk to you face to face I'd have to well get on a plane you know that cuts a whole lot of time off right there yeah uh and I'd have to go all the way to Sacramento and even then I'm going to take a car which cuts off a certain amount of time and get there but not only that uh so so we've done we've organized our lives in such a way you know just the word convenience is all about this mystical process of saving time and then I realized also this gets to the heart of human relationships because you know think about love people seem so willing at least for the last 50 years things are kind of getting weird right now but people have been so willing to commit their bodies to each other and then on the next level their emotions and then when things get inconvenient they depart and what's strange about that is what's the missing ingredient well it's the worst thing of all it's commitment and commitment is the love relationship in time and I also started to see that Faith is a process in time words only occur in time this is I'm getting from Jacques Alon his book the humiliation of the word words only exist in time now what we're doing right now well what I'm speaking and what you're speaking are just words we've added to it this layer of video which we then save and abstract but the interesting thing about that is once it's saved and abstracted it's no longer the straight word well what it is is it's a recording of the word so therefore it's repeatable and it's starting to enter the visual category so but real words real conversation face to face it's not just words we're watching but it's the whole human behind the word it's the pauses it's the little gestures it's the uncomfortable movings on the seat plus you see when a word hits somebody you just see that little thing in their face go huh or oh you know you see the reactions all that's part of the word but the actual words do not appear anywhere in space they are completely you know the now I have worked in audio recording for quite a while I know very well I can record my words and then watch the spectrograph and watch the little chart and see the you know the action but the truth is if I then come along and watch just those visualizations of my words there's no meaning so the meaning of the word it only happens in time not space meaning happens in time more than space now obviously both of these things should be in balance we live a life on earth in space with the stuff but we also live a life of meaning and so what we do is that we have a sort of what is it a we have a meaningful meaning happens it's like between things it's not happening it's you know when you look at a thing you don't get the meaning from it until you form a relationship to it so relationships happen in time and what so relationships happen in time and and then I had this idea and a lot of the problems are once you cut off the effects of time you then cut off the meaning of relationships the meaning of words well what happened was at a certain point rick mocker details this very well people politely during the enlightenment period pushed god out the picture out of the picture because god can't be weighed and measured so let me actually dive into this right now so this is where the science issue becomes very important I think science is very directly a result I mean you know there's there was science in China there was science in the Islamic world and after a while they were just kind of stuck in the mud doing whatever I mean I saw some video the other day saying that one of the turning points in human history was is the Islamic golden age to which I'm saying like no I think if we if that's all we had we'd all just be doing algebra we wouldn't have Copernicus and Galileo and Newton and I think the turning point is when the Christians having you know gratefully been re-exposed to these concepts of mathematics and their rediscovery of the Greek philosophers and you know Archimedes and all of this stuff but they took it and they I think one of the big differences between Islam and Christianity is in Islam the world is all determined in a way that you know it's only if Allah allows but in Christianity it's that first chapter second chapter of Genesis where God says you know investigate everything name the animals and the naming isn't just like you know you know naming you know naming a dog bob or something like that it's naming the dog the dog you know it's not calling the tree Susan it's naming the tree as as a tree and so um so I think what happened was the Christians uh the early the early Christian uh scientists and and here's the thing science is totally a product this modern science is totally a product of this Christian thing that happened somewhere between the renaissance and the reformation and one of the things they did was they started looking out you know Copernicus looks out and says you know it's not quite doing what it was supposed to do out in outer space it's doing something else I think actually we're going around the sun it's kind of a radical concept uh but you know you're just looking and and weighing because the world was open it wasn't full of taboos and that's the thing about uh the Christians that was different than so many other places we didn't have taboos about what we couldn't look at so then you get you know uh people often will point out that you know oh the wicked church and Galileo and how they you know what they did to him was terrible well keep in mind what they were calling their view of the cosmos actually was coming from Aristotle and not it wasn't uh based on that so Galileo remained a Christian he never like said oh that's it I give up there's no god um Newton believed in god they Descartes believed in god uh uh Levenhut the Dutch one he he once said that you know he's the one guy who first saw the microscopic world through a microscope and he said I used to think god created the world now I think god created two worlds you see so all these people you know Francis Bacon and his own kind of strange way they all in some way believed in god and one of the things they did and I think this was by accident they fell so in love with weighing and measuring things that everything was then put into spatial categories Galileo has these primary attributes and secondary attributes in reality in the the world so a primary attribute would be like substance solidity and a secondary attribute would be color and because color is dependent on the eyes and Owen Barfield points out well eventually we come to realize that this solidity thing we think is so strong isn't really that solid either and so that becomes dependent and so eventually the only thing left over in the primary category is mathematics which strikes me as strange because that's completely abstract and unrelated to life you know a dog doesn't walk around in a mathematical world you know a dog just walks around in the world as is and you know you don't need mathematics to get along in the world at all you know so but but we became so in love with the processes of weighing and measuring and mathematics and such Galileo got into pendulums they they all started they what they started to do with time was they started to visualize it and a lot of people get mixed up they think that time is the clock it's the duration but it isn't because everyone's experience of time is different so if you take three people if you take someone who's who is working just a common hummed up drum you know cashier at mcdonald's or they're probably not using the word cashier anymore they're probably using you know front of office a front of house customer service representative thank you and and then you have someone who's just fallen in love and then you have someone who one of closest their closest relatives has just died now each of these people are going to inhabit the next duration of say an hour but the way they inhabit that hour will be totally different the person at mcdonald's for instance will just be hoping to get through the day and literally will not remember this hour at all because if you if you go back to them and say you know what was it like in april 26th and 2021 when you were working at mcdonald's they go like oh i you know it's the same as i can't you know it's the same as the day before and the day after you know unless something really big happens to cause a memory there but the person who's just fallen in love oh my gosh that hour is going to go by too quickly but it's going to be so meaningful you know reflecting oh i can't believe she said this oh he said that oh i can't you know and then the person for whom someone has died it's just going to be a slow sludge to get through that hour now of course that's just three abstract people it gets much more personal depending on who you're talking to in all of their history and so i think what happened was that when they were weighing and measuring things they kind of opened up this trap door opening the door up for the enlightenment so that well we can't weigh and measure god so maybe god doesn't exist and once you open that door the rest of the door that starts to open is everything else in time and that is to say time is about relationships one of the things that's very clear to me is that right now if you look at the subatomic particles it used to be we thought that the world was made of matter and yes there is matter there are these little particles and somehow they hold together to form things and you know we are held together of little bits and particles of matter but the truth is it isn't the matter that's important it's the space between them it's the relationships of everything so that you know why do things appear the way they do the mystery isn't that there's something there spinning you know these little protons and neutrons and quarks and all of this the real mystery is what holds them together what is the relationship but that but the concept of relationship goes back and back and back to everything so you know what is the problem with our environment right now our relationship to it and we have treated it as a physical materialistic object based on the hardening of science see i think the original science was great but then you start getting to science scientists who basically say well all there is is the stuff the stuff and our math is the most important thing and what we see walking around well that's or or actually a friend of mine who's a biologist i was talking i have i've had two different kinds of friends in the biology field i had one who dealt with things in the lab you know kind of molecular biologist type and then i had another who is a field biologist who studies turtles but also things in alaska and to the molecular biologist who thinks they're dealing with the reality because they're dealing with the abstraction and the stuff they look at the guy in the field and i've heard this actually said it's being almost like it's almost like the occult what are you doing out there with looking at that bear and studying it as if that which form we form relationships with is not nearly as important as the abstract you know uh theories that we come up with about these things and rookmacher says a very important thing and he says this in his what is reality he says you you see what you know which also means which also means you don't see what you don't know and then he points out john lock said no you just know what you see all there is is what you weigh and measure but rookmacher says you know you're right mr lock but you have reduced reality that which is measurable and it's quite clear that's not the entire story so it the problem is following the materialistic line of science having left out this time component see the time component isn't just you know uh it takes an hour for x event to happen or we measured it within an hour that's reducing it to a visual component what the time component is right hang out a second i gotta get the mail you can keep talking i just gotta get the mail because our mailbox got stolen go for it um so basically what that means is that uh we're anyway okay time time uh tarkovsky says time is personal and that means that uh we have we all inhabit time differently like what i was saying about the different kinds of time but the truth is physics in the 20th century started to come to the same conclusion so that in chaos science and quantum theory in information theory they started to see these sorts of things so that you know you can stare at a waterfall all you want and it'll never look the same twice but it'll always look like a waterfall and that's like chaos theory so you know the the truth is everything actually you know einstein said you know that einstein of course made the big discovery of time and space and the interesting thing is the time at in death valley is slightly different than the time on the top of mount everest which is very odd you see in time everything has a unique position what science does is it takes a slide of blood looks at it and says well this is what's happening for everything that this blood is attached to but you know then you go to the hospital and if they treat you like that you know it you know you've been treated mechanistically and the truth is it's never that simple every case is different everyone is different so what i came to understand is that now what's interesting is that there's a kind of a hierarchy of sciences with physics being on top and then you know chemistry biology and others being on the bottom then almost in in the occult realm as things like psychology you know so that but here's the thing what they discovered in physics takes a while to dribble down to the other sciences so biology is still very mechanistic and you know when people start telling me you know we are based upon you know the chem that the chemistry is is is causing us to do things and all this i'm going like no you've got it wrong and michael palanian his book personal knowledge talks about boundary conditions and what he says a boundary condition is is like say i'm water i have so much water inside of me that's a boundary condition so that you know i don't know it's you know more than half of my body is water generally that doesn't affect me day to day that is to say if i get enough liquid and you know i don't have diarrhea and it's not too hot and i'm not drinking poisoned water you know i don't think about it the fact that i'm made of water doesn't tell me about why i'm speaking to you neither does dna dna is another boundary condition it's a more elaborate boundary condition but dna doesn't tell me again what my words mean it has nothing to do with that so if i think if we actually have to turn it around science tries to take the smallest abstraction to explain the larger phenomenon but i think it's the other way around we have to start with the most complex thing and which we do we start with the most complex thing our brain we look at a slide and we do come up obviously the stuff is important the materialistic world is important it's important enough that you know we have made many discoveries in medicine we have been able to send you know a rocket ship to mars and have some little thing get out there and probe it and send images back to us that's pretty amazing but that doesn't explain why we we exist you know or even why we sent the rocket ship to mars yes i mean there's there's many things we can do in the world and we do a lot of things but why i mean because and that you know you're you're a little bit older than i am and so you very much remember i mean all of the hullabaloo about the apollo program and all the excitement but then it all peters out basically because people get to the point of we're going there because it's a rock well and and you see this with the question of why the chinese didn't you know go out and take the world well they just why should we well you know as larry norman sang in one of his songs they brought back a lot of rocks they must have been really nice rocks that's what we got out of it you know and that in a nice picture of the earth and uh but no i mean you see the thing is all of our technological advances all our scientific advances did not answer the question of who we are and then what happened was there was this ripple effect from the enlightenment and the science that came from that perspective which then started to say well maybe you know okay it starts off okay we just put god out of the picture human life should go fine and then eventually you start saying stuff to yourself well you know is it you know freud comes along goes is it love no it's really libido and you know so we try to or nowadays it's love no it's more of a chemical reaction you know it's the pheromones and it's this and that uh you know and the people have in other words what's happened is all the things i think joy love truth beauty all these big qualities that used to be so important are all categories that are relationships in time and i think evil yeah i think the most evil person on the world would be the person who could get things done just by wanting it done just by imagining it done and having someone bring it to them instantly that is to say they would be the person who could violate time the greatest and i think we live in a world now where there is so little meaning because we no longer live in time we live against time we rather than accept time that things take a while we live against time and so that's why i think that we have so many problems see what's happened and if rick mocker is right about you see what you know i think and and adding to the some of the thoughts of barfield i think when you look at the past we don't understand the past because we only see what we know and in our lifetime we're both old enough to have seen what we know change radically but it hasn't changed radically in terms of meaning it's turned changed radically to strip the meaning it's like var you know paint stripper it's stripping the meaning so all the life lived online it has not added to the meaning it has made it more difficult to meet to see the meaning or as paul virilio a catholic uh thinker who died a couple years ago really interesting thinker he said every new device we invent for seeing is one more degree to which we can't see because we put the thing in front of us you know there's a difference on the simplest level between using your eyes and putting glasses on or we're looking through a window and you can tell there's a difference you know the the sun hits you differently you don't feel certain things you know when you have glasses you always kind of have to try to get the the forehead grease off of them and whatnot it's you know but the more you know we had cameras and we had um television and we had film and we had photos and you know that's why our lives have become these very strange things where people i i saw this in alaska tourism by the way i have a really great series coming up called tourism and reality but i would see this where people would come off of a huge floating hotel cruise ship they would walk uh the the town i lived in was just majestically surrounded by mountains they're walking off a fjord into mountains there's going to be bears there's going to they might have seen whales on the way and what are they looking at when they walk off the ship their phones and to me that says it all that's our world and when they get to places what do they do when they get there if if there's a bear in the background they want a selfie yeah it doesn't matter yeah yeah and that can get dangerous you know it's my job to prevent them from meeting reality oh you're you're in a rick bachar's point i really do like that line you know you see what you know and that you know when you look at say peterson's i really like peterson's conversation with roger scrutin yeah because that's that's exactly where he went there and he said you know we see what do we see but we basically see what we know and and these other little you see this all the time between people and you see this especially online and something like twitter where it's very low resolution you're just constantly projecting onto everything you see on twitter all of your own things and even in relationships you know romantic relationships it takes a fairly long time to actually see through what you're massively projecting onto that other person to have them slowly emerge up from your projection based on you know the the interaction and i really like the way you laid all of this out and and that you know you who have done so much interesting thought and work on media and film you know it and i don't know to what degree you're living this where you're living it now but you know we both grew up in a world in which television was really coming to the fore and we had i grew up in the new york metropolitan area so we had probably the most channels that anybody had on tv you know we had right you know seven or eight and then you had and crazy eddie so yes we did we certainly did and and so but then and then of course you go to cable tv so you have the multiplication and now of course with streaming it is it is really amazing to me how just on now on my smart television in my home with a handful of streaming services plus you know i got an amazon fire stick so i could do the recast thing so i could have local channels so my wife didn't have one have wires so i do all these gymnastics to avoid wires which she hates because i've made her live with wires all these years but the amount of programming available to me now as compared to when i was a child with the television in the new york city area it's just staggering and then i watch you know my family members and other people just scrolling through even just netflix i can't find anything to watch on netflix and it's like when i was a kid i would have sat down and just you know you just turn on something i had seven or eight choices and of course the v the vhs came along and we could go and rent a movie and that was you know transformational we could see a movie i mean what what's your take on this with what's what's going on with us and seeing and knowing because it very much seems like has everything to do with time yeah it does absolutely here's an interesting thing you remember when you were younger you would get a roll of film and put it in your camera of course you had to be very careful not to expose it to the light and sometimes you did or sometimes it didn't click and you didn't take any of the photos so you had anywhere from 12 to 24 sometimes 36 frames that you could expose yeah you weren't probably a great photographer i wasn't when i was young i'm better now but you know it was you would you would take these and then when you got them there was the process of waiting for him now at a certain point it used to take a couple of days and then they had then they had one and then it became one hour photo right but here's the thing when you got your photos you would often look through them and you say okay that's not good that's not good that's not good oh here's a nice one and then you would take it maybe put it in a photo album the good ones the best and then you would sometimes what would happen in the family is people hey let me show you my photos and you'd sit down and you would share open the book and share your photos here's how photos work now we have endless photos of ourselves i mean literally i i have a friend who's probably taken i would conservatively estimate 50 000 photos of his children from the time they were born until now and they were in their teens um then when i watch people uh on i watch people uh because i worked in tourism you taking photos and so they're floating past eagles they're watching bears and stuff and what do they do they will come to you afterwards and then they'll show you their nowadays it's their phone and they'll just swipe through oh look at this one look at this one look at this one look at this one and guess what that's the most anyone's ever going to see are these things they've just simply yeah and it's very weird the more we have the ability to take unlimited photos the more worthless the photos become so i don't know about you i have i think about 10 photos of myself before the age of 10 oh yeah i sometimes i because i'm always i'm always working on something and i think boy sure would have been nice to have a few it sure would have been good to have taken a few pictures during i mean this huge area of my life my father took some you find some random pictures up but it's like it's like a photo desert until the smartphone and and until i got my first elect my digital dslr but consider this so i've been working on this rookmacher project i just put another one up of his views of scholarship which is actually reality part two and he talks about the difficulties he has four points he says everything in scholarship is uncertain he says part two there are many many things in the world that are totally certain part three we all see things through our different colored glasses so each person and each uh philosophical uh leaning looks through things with different colored glasses depending on all the things that go into your life and your thoughts and finally the mystery is we can actually communicate and that's his points but in doing these these rookmacher things he uh i been in contact with his daughter marlene and i asked her you know send me all the pictures of rookmark you can where he's like teaching or in some way just whatever whatever you got do you have any visual of film images or anything so she did there's about 20 and one one home movie that shows him a couple i would say if you added up the amount of time he's in the movie it's about i don't 30 35 seconds that's it that's all the docu visual documentation on rookmacher in the prime of his life and you know what makes each of those photos a whole lot more valuable yeah yeah yeah and what's really fascinating is the the movie that i had uh that she sent me it's also it was filmed in dutch librae and um i showed part of it in in my lecture just as a an illustration of something that is to say not the rookmacher part but here's some people walking down a road kind of thing and one of my youtube subscribers said that's me he saw himself he didn't know this film existed and and i said great i'm going to send you this film and uh and you know and he said it was just such an incredible thing to him he lives in australia and um and i thought to myself that's the power of the film you know of the image but but the more you have of a thing the more but here's the interesting thing people are always taking photos of things they're supposed to take photos of so like even if you go to disney world there will be a place that says photo spot so you go up to this photo spot you get a picture of the castle you go to the next one get a picture of the monorail or whatever and you're sitting there saying to yourself and then the next person comes up and does the same thing and this is what i saw in the louvre at mona lisa you know and there were other big things too like wing victory but and everyone's just getting that shot yeah yeah and the weird thing is it lessens the mona lisa and walker percy has an interesting essay called the loss of the creature i have a copy of it if you want me to send it to you sometime it's really fascinating he he makes a uh a thought he says is looking like sucking the more you do the less there is is and he talks about for instance the grand canyon he says you go to the grand canyon now you're already in trouble first of all the words grand canyon tell you it but it's not just that you've already seen probably movies of it you've seen pictures of it you've seen all these lovely you know like national park porn you know it's just this these images and then you get there and it's an overcast day and you say this doesn't look like the pictures yeah and he says you you have a preformed symbol complex is the word he used so that what you do is you you're looking through uh this the set of images that's been put there before you and he talks about cardenas who was the first westerner to discover the grand canyon and he says you will never have the experience of cardenas yeah because cardenas was just kind of going along with his on a horseback with his cavalieros and then breaking through the mesquite is el grande canyón you know it's like they were just like stunned they called it the grand canyon to them it was truly grand you know it's this amazing thing he says but then he says well how do you recover how can you recover the preacher he says there are different techniques that people have tried to use one is to to find um uh you know to to find an alternative way of looking at it you know so instead of taking the trail you get off the trail you know you look for try to find look at it in a new way but he says the problem with that is for instance so you cut through a trail and you find this great new vantage point that no one really goes to at the grand canyon and eventually the national park service gets wind of it and then they look at your trail and they go like actually that's a pretty nice trail let's get everyone else to watch this yeah look at this so it only lasts for a little while you know he says another possibility is to look over the shoulders of the people looking there so you go there and i did this when i went to the mona lisa i went i didn't go to see the mona lisa in the loo i did go to look at some art but i didn't go to see the mona lisa but i did go to see the crowds at the mona lisa so i have a video of this on my gravity from above channel of just the crowds looking at it so he says what you're doing is you're not looking at the thing itself you're looking at the way it's consumed and digested he says uh he says back in the day new yorker articles were often like in this mode it's almost tech takes a superior sense of the self he says but he says imagine here's a way to see the grand canyon differently so let's say it's world war two and this really happened and you're uh no one was going to the national parks in world war two so what they did was they took the bright angel lodge on the north rim which is the more beautiful rim most people see the south but the north is where the action is but they turned the bright angel lodge into a recuperation center for u.s soldiers in the war so imagine this you're wounded in battle you're unconscious you wake up yeah out of a coma or something or you're finally able to see the bandages are undone and outside your window is the grand canyon see now you've rediscovered the creature and he gives one more example and he says you go there with a loved one it's just like you're with your wife or whatever you're with your husband and you're having the most horrific argument you can possibly have you're you're in tears you're trying to discuss things things are going nowhere and you're right on the edge of the grand canyon so it's but it's because the thing has been lost through our looking and i think this goes back to science weighing and measuring and not seeing the relationships of things putting everything into abstract boxes so that we can no longer touch it's like we make the thing what photo photography does is it makes available to everyone what the scientist does when they weigh and measure you can also turn photography into an art which is different but i think the secret is that everything is a relationship and the the quick that's why tinder is such a problem you know anything that tries to anything that tries to shortcut a process that should take a while gets to be a problem so whether it's fast food or travel or you know it's just like two-week travel vacation and in europe and i can tell you you're just going to be rushing from place to place and what you'll see is the stuff you're supposed to see right and what you know so well and no i think this is all really good and it's it's it's very helpful i mean you just put down so many interesting ideas there it's going to take a little time for me to sort of chew through them you know especially i like you know i like what you just walked out in terms of walker percy because i think about um i've never been to europe my parents have never been to europe at some point i think um i will get to europe and when now i'm in this strange position that when i go to europe let's say well it's it's a tougher sell i mean even though just via you i'd love to i'd love to visit tobleese georgia because i've never thought of georgia about the only thing i ever knew of georgia is that where joseph stalin came from and that's hardly a selling point but um but then you know i because of you i look at some of the videos and i then i do with some of the background the pictures i think wow that is a that is a whole world that most americans just you know because then i think about well at some point at some point i do want to get to europe and so let's say i go to the uk now i've got people who watch my channel that i converse with regularly in the uk and if i go to the netherlands of course i have to visit job but i'm going to have my wife with me because she's never been to europe and the last thing she wants to do is follow me around as i spend you know three days talking with job about stuff we talk about that she's not in the room and where she'd like to okay what would we see in the uk what would we see in the netherlands and and we're only just talking about the the tiniest tiny little bits of your but you're exactly right is that okay well these are all the major things when my wife first um when my wife and i were dating and she first came to new jersey with me and uh she wanted to see new york i said great i said what do you want to see she gave me this whole list of course i lived outside of new york so i've been there all these times and so i said we can't do this she's like no you're just you know you're sandbagging me i said okay sweetheart let's let's have priorities tell me what you want to see most it's a statue of liberty i said okay do you want to go up and down in the thing she said absolutely i said okay just keep your list we'll just start there and of course anybody who's done the statue of liberty knows that was the day and actually she never left she never really left new jersey i don't care what the state of new york says but um that's another thing i get it i get it but but but that's such an interesting idea you know so i live quite close to yosemite national park i love going to yosemite national park i visit it regularly during the pandemic my wife and i because there's so little things you can do what we've sort of done during this pandemic is every week she and i just sit in the car and we drive for about eight to ten hours and we've just been going all through northern california all these back roads i mean just just just stunningly beautiful places where nobody is around and nobody lives and it's you know it's it's amazing to me but then you go to yosemite and which we go regularly but it's there's very much this thing my children are always complaining to me because i take pictures of what everybody else takes pictures of and it's like well what am i trying to do with my umpteenth picture of half dome am i trying to approximate ansel adams what exactly am i trying to capture what am i doing and it's like i do this and i don't even know what i'm doing right now the truth is back in 1980 i discovered susan somtag's book on photography i don't agree with everything she says but that caused me to think about what i was doing with photography so much that i didn't take another photo till 1993 oh my yeah but then what happened was i rediscovered the photos i took of my jesus people days and i realized wow this really captures a time yeah and that's really important and then i realized in new york city i'm in a time now yeah i need to capture it and that's when i started taking photos again and then i realized that the point of the photos for me was for me to to look at things and to see them in new ways but also to take photos of people to document the people i wanted to remember and how i wanted to remember them how i saw them and i am so glad i did because i captured my last few years in new york city very well and i think again the problem with travel is everyone is sold through you know you're watching rick steves or you're watching youtube channels and and you get these views now i've watched rick steves enough and been to you know quite a few of the places he talks about to know how i would this is the kind of the thing is like okay i'm gonna have to enter into this thing and try to explain what's going on with tourism because it's a lot more complicated than it seems and i think actually tourism is it's it's actually deforming reality because what it's done is turned reality into a consumer product so for instance one of the things that often happens in any tourist place is that there will be you know variations on the culture that used to be there presented to you so if you go to certain you know wild west towns or ghost towns there will be things to you know remind you of the ghost towns you can go to skagway alaska and take the train up in the mountains and and there's people like doing kind of theatrical productions of you know the gold mining era and such all these are totally fake you know that is to say they don't write i often in 1998 they were celebrating the 100th anniversary of the skagway klandeig gold rush and i said you know it's really interesting they're celebrating 1998 in 1998 they're celebrating 1898 will anyone ever celebrate 1998 no because it didn't exist 1998 was just simply the commercialization of 1898 you know you can go to sitka alaska and they have these russian dancers there none of them are actually russian there aren't really that any russians hardly left at all there you know maybe a orthodox priest and some natives who are still orthodox but essentially uh you know that's just there for the tourists so what are so what are we doing you know i'm thinking about holland michigan because i didn't grow up there but i went to calvin college eventually with a bunch of kids who did the clompin dance at tulip time and you know and and i you know i lived in the dominican republic for a while in this little town where the country was really trying to get some tourism going in that little town it just never succeeded but as when i lived there in the country when people would come to visit i would we'd take people down to certain areas of the capital the colonial district of the capital where you had some old buildings and a little tourist trap and we'd take people there and people come out to california sometimes we'll take them to alcatraz and we'll go to the pier and in san francisco but but you always you know when people come to california i like to say if there's one place i want to take you i want to take you to yosemite and we're you know we're going to we're going to go down to the val and you're going to get your picture of half dome and el capitán but what we really should do is just find a little out of the way place this is how what my wife and i like to do in these national parks find a little out of the way place that's far enough from the road and maybe go sit in because they're usually canyons out here at west go sit in the river for a few hours or you know find some little quiet spot so so so it's really interesting to me you know this this tourism and reality business because you're right we sort of package it and commodify it and of course disney and vegas and i don't know if you saw the first season of westworld you know it's it's all this you know it's it's one part nostalgia it's you know it's a very strange thing yeah well we've done something to ourselves but here's the it tourism turns out it seems like something that's like the froth on the top of the the latte but it's something much deeper and here's the weird thing now i've spent time in paris spent time in london spent time in prog spent time well obviously here spent time in alaska spent time in new york since spent time in san francisco spent time in los angeles i've spent time in a lot of places and watched the tourism and i've been personally involved with tourism in alaska i've been to prog and watched it change over the years through tourism and i'm watching what's happening here as they want tourism and i'm also watching the collapse of economies right now because tourism isn't happening right i'm also watching the the amount of pollution generated through tourism is staggering oh yes yeah you can see that in the dominican republic and people i mean prostitution and tourism they think well often don't talk about that but oh yeah prostitution and tourism is like this yeah yeah sex tourism yeah you know i mean hello thailand you know um and also it's what is it it's it's it's fed to us here's okay here's here's where the rubber really meets the road what do people say in small town america in small suburb america about why they want to get out of there there's nothing to do yeah yeah so where do they want to go they want to go to these places that are sold to them and it's this very strange thing i think if there's a i've got one of the episodes i want to do out of these 10 episodes is going to be the emptying out of you know there there's this guy named nick johnson who has a channel that's very interesting where he drives around america and just shows you what he'll go to say he just did one i think the the you know 10 worst place 10 worst places in you know ohio and he'll drive through them and what you'll see is these small towns with boarded up windows and you know the the towns have just become meth labs you know they've become they've been destroyed by the walmarts but they've also been destroyed by the fact that these towns if you went back to the 1950s 60s maybe even in 70s you would have seen actual life in these towns people coming and going talking and stuff but more and more the towns become shadows of the very dark shadows yeah meanwhile tourism grows meanwhile everyone wants to go live in a big city i think i think all the what we're seeing right now but for the last year and a year and a and change it goes on is changing that equation of people are starting you know idaho again you know this is the 60s and 70s in some ways there's a lot of repetition in there but exactly so i think that but but we are so susceptible to what walker percy calls the pre-formed symbol complex we are so susceptible to that you know and and so people have these images that you know they they they are fed and that they you know it's just like ireland is green you know and you just see going through the hills holland has those cute little canals and old buildings you know and and switzerland the alps oh my goodness and you could take a train up to the matterhorn and what they're not telling you is they're not telling you about the fact that ireland is a pretty modern place where a lot of it is you know it's not the old ireland of you know uh you know that it's not all the green stuff you know holland is not all little canals and and quaint buildings you know there's also a really dark underbelly to places like amsterdam and such um there you know so what you try to get to the matterhorn good luck it's one of the most crowded places on earth yeah yeah you know oh it's yosemite valley too i mean i never go there i avoid there in the summer because oh gosh i mean if i want to sit in traffic i'll drive to the bay area oh yeah no that's the thing i i know exactly what you're talking about uh it's been since the 90s since i went to uh yosemite but even that it was just insane you know and i think that we are creating this very strange world for ourselves and you know and when a when you factor in that that how this relates to not only the economy but the governments of of countries particularly small countries that only you know they live for tourism yeah you know there's a great uh little weird documentary uh that you can find on youtube called cannibal tours and it's set in new guinea and it was in the late 80s i think it was maybe early 90s and it was about the first um tourist ships coming to new guinea and what's great about this documentary is you have mostly germans and italians a couple americans here so everything's translated but they also subtitle the things that the natives are saying the tribes people are saying so at one point they're sitting on these like something like top of cloths or something on the ground the the tribes people and the tourists are coming up they show this rich german tourist come up and he's got his camera and everything and he looks down and there's a carved mask made of wood and he's saying you know how much for that and she says something like ten dollars and he goes like five and then here's the the translation of the woman turning to her friend after he walks away he goes like i don't know why they say this tourism is so good for us i spent six months working on that and then a little bit later another tourist is wanting to get a picture posed with one of the tribesmen they've since converted to christianity and are no longer cannibals but he wants to get a picture of the guy in his tribal regalia with like a spear like he's going to kill him and eat him and to me that those images in a nutshell say everything that is the horror of tourism it's this creation of this completely artificial it's a strange relationship that we have created to the actual earth and the and its people we you know it starts in switzerland back in the late early romantic era but what's happened over the years is it's is it's gone from being you know like you know the grand european tour to being you know now everyone can just hop on a plane and go anywhere and it and so as we can hop on a plane and go anywhere the the nowhere we are from becomes more and more strange to us and yet we don't actually see the places we're going to see we or we get a glimpse of them or or as rookmacher says you know americans now but now i think we can say people around the world because he was talking in the 70s he says used to be people go to the same place every year to take their vacation yeah now he says i think we're just chasing reality and not and as soon as there's a danger of discovering it we leave do you think this is related to recorded music because again music used to be you would spend a good part of your life developing your capacity to make music and then there would be performance music which would be to a degree relational and then of course as things scale up now you've got theaters in which now you've got some distance between performers you know one of the one of the things i remember about walker percy is he had this terrific piece that he wrote about the difference between a high school science lab and the kid on the the kid on a beach who stumbles across a dogfish washed up on the shore and he's got a pen knife and he's sort of right you know cutting it open and and so it seems to me there's there's some of that relationship that you spend your life developing this capacity to make music and you inhabit the music and the music is yours and then of course once you get recorded music now now where well i'm playing this music in order to play you know in order to approximate you have this in church all the time now where you've got all of this recorded christian music and then well now here in church we're sort of singing these songs that we have listened to you know 50 or 100 times that have been all professionally done i mean is that is it that kind of relationship that you've just stepped into like the major hornet's nest of all of my thinking i know that's why i step in i mean this is where i started essentially right well here's what i've learned what recording did was it began to be a substitute for the live musician so for instance we we all know the phrase the jukebox and the jukebox is you know you punch in a few uh numbers and you play your song the jukebox got its name because they started putting them in juke joints and juke joints were these places down south where it was often you know on different sides of the tracks but you know kind of the uh kind of iffy bars you might say yes slightly sleazy a little bit underbelly but you'd have your blues musicians and such playing there well when they put the jukebox in they no longer needed the blues musicians they could just play the records in the classical world as recording got better and better the orchestras had to get more and more mechanical like a metronome to approximate the recording people one of the things that's very interesting is that uh there's been a movement in the last uh last 50 years in different ways to try to play certain baroque era pieces and early classical pieces the way they were meant to be played right and they sound much more you know like of all these four seasons on a contemporary recording should now sound much more like it sounded in the past but if you heard it an older recording it sounds kind of like very like grand and and kind of stately but it doesn't have that light skipping almost dance-like quality that the originals have right um the real big culprit here is less the recording than the microphone the microphone changes the relationship of everything because what happens is similar to the camera well different in that the microphone immediately creates a relationship between the person holding it and the people listening to it because you also have the amplification system and the person holding it is more godlike right so it's not a mystery that you started getting fandom of a crazy nature when you started getting microphones so frank sinatra elvis presley you know the rolling stones the beetles uh led zeppelin all these people would be nothing well not nothing but they would be much less had they not have amplification in the way they do or as pete townsend of the who once said if you want to understand what power is in rock music you plug your guitar into an embankment of martial amplifiers you crank them up to 10 and you play for a stadium and you control the entire 50 000 people once you hit that power cord that's what technology does the next layer added on top of that was uh the video so the video changes the relationship of music to people entirely one of the things that happens along the way also is in the beginning of i do in my in my study on minstrel music i talk about the origins of commercial music and what i point out is that commercial music or what we might call pop music but i i like to call it commercial music is to music what mcdonald's is to a hamburger and that is to say it is a repeatable commodity that emphasizes the aspects that everyone likes so in a mcdonald's hamburger you know in in fast food in general uh you have your basic you know you you have a sweet you have salty you have fat these are the three the three keys you know because that's what our tongues go like i'm happy and you know a little bit of tang a little bit of heat a little bit of this but those three things in different forms are the ones that really make us go yeah well in music the things that make us go yeah are emotion but there's a difference between say deep emotion and commercial emotion so you know just as there's a difference between home cooking your homemade hamburger where you might put some real swiss cheese on your hamburger and maybe you know fry up some thick bacon instead of some thin mcdonald's bacon and put on your own special sauce and grill it on a grill and you know you see you suddenly it's all i'm starting to get hungry wanting that you know that's that's the real thing and it's got real flavor to it you put real quality and caring to it again it's the relationship but the in music what it is is that the what what sells is emotion but it's not genuine emotion sometimes there is an overlap between what's popular and what's good that is say what's actually good music so one could say certain parts of the Beatles work is good music and it's also popular but then again if one listens to Britney Spears one can't really say the same thing one has to say it's essentially just commercial music poor Britney poor poor Britney or Britney uh i don't mean to dump on her there's a lot of artists that for whom that is true yeah well they're commodified i mean i mean this has been a this has been a trope in pictures and i mean we've watched this industry but it starts back in the minstrel era where you have men putting on blackface and the second song in a minstrel show after the exciting song was always the plantation song and the plantation song was a slow mellow song about life this this emotional life on the plantation of which the singers and interestingly enough minstrel music starts in new york city the singers knew nothing about so they're inventing this world i mean and the music doesn't sound like you know slow black folks music it sounds like what the truth is it sounds an awful lot like barbershop quartets and broadway musicals because in fact that is the origins of these things there's this the origins of all this syrupy cheap music come out of this imitation of emotion that's another form of tourism i mean that's we're talking about the same thing here because it's it's the production of the the romantic nostalgic plantation in the south right and and and i see cultures do that i mean in the dominican republic they keep doing this for the cane fields and all the cane fields and but and nobody in their right mind would torture that's right what do i want to work a cane field with a machete i mean i i worked with people who did that and boy they sure as heck like to get out of that work because it's horrible yeah yeah well here's here's the interesting thing is that this um this artificial emotion becomes the dominant point in music but it's in the 1870s guess where it shows up in music give you a hint you work in one in the church uh-huh well well and and again and church and here's where it shows up it starts showing up there's a specific style and it's called gospel song not to be confused with gospel music and gospel song is the kind of music that ira sankhi would sing before dwight l moody evangelistic rally that that homa rota heaver would sing before a billy sunday service that george Beverly shea would sing before a billy graham rally they had these singers doing this to create this sense of emotion so there are certain songs i mean one that's to me the most egregious of all is in the garden you know he walks with me and he talks yeah yeah yeah but by the end of the 20th century you're going to be getting uh it's corn you know nice pretty girls singing love songs to jesus you know that really sound erotic in some strange way but but you see what happened was it what it is is it's romanticism the philosophical strain poured into commercialism in in the in a way of finding a way to sell it that's the same thing that's happening in tourism tourism is the the the older romantic movement poured through uh a commercial industry to sell you a trip somewhere okay so let's get into the question okay i think we all we got lots of examples of this in various ways and we note that it's it's certainly commercial now we've used the word artificial i mean we're certainly right now in this it's so it's so funny to me how how people will say i just really want to an experience of the authentic says you can come to my church we got we got authenticity all over the place and usually once people see it hey it's like you know hey you want to cut a cane field go for it you don't have the kind of authenticity you don't want but it's so so what exactly are we talking about here um because we would say yeah this is this is inauthentic this is artificial this is um this is there's a sense of of henry well this is mass produced right let me pull two things apart though okay art of this can be good that is to say you know when you go to a theater you want to see someone put on artifice to become something else that's what you're you're paying for you're paying to see someone act which is an artifice yes so the artificial by itself isn't necessarily bad but it's the it's the substitution for the reality of the thing for this other image of the thing which is not authentic so uh what is it like you have um see what's happened in the churches and i think this is one of the main reasons why people have fled is that this this artificial thing but really this inauthentic substitute uh oh sorry let's let's just use the bodriard word the simulacra there you go the simulacra of christian music has made it so that if you're not in the church and you walk in and you hear this stuff you just go like oh my goodness i'm just getting sick to my stomach listening to it you know i mean think of a song like shine jesus shine if you if you ever heard that you know the yeah you're starting to think about diabetic shock insulin shock you know it's and yet some i actually heard that once at a funeral i just really i i was aghast that anyone would sing such a thing at a funeral but but in a weird way and this is what this is sort of where i come to with because i i mean i we once had a i had a friend of mine do a retreat for a church and we're trying to improve things this is years ago and so he did all this cultural artifact stuff and and and trying to boil down the church into three words and i finally i got it and it was dumpy campy homie and of course i told the members of this is what we are they told the members of the church they're horrified you know none of those words are right but it's but but there's a weird way in which this thing inverts all the way around and the the person soulfully singing shine jesus shine at a funeral becomes so strange it sort of regains authenticity because it's like nobody who nobody who knows better would do this and so this is all they know it's sort of like i've told the story before this i was in a hospital visiting a family and there was a member of the family was dying this horrible death and it was visceral and this brother and sister grab each other and they start singing these are two people raised in the church start singing the kenny rogers song you know the gambler you got to know when to hold and and i'm just sitting here watching this thinking of all the songs in the universe this is the song this brother and sister have bonded over and and even the kenny rogers song the gambler that too is is is almost this i mean it's just thick with tourism in a way because you know who would really want to live in the wild west right right it's it's a it's a it's a romanticized version of yes oh wild west gambling casino right and this is what these two people say minus the spittoons yeah you know uh no we yeah i see this also with funeral services where people want uh to play the song on a recording of their you know that that uh the loved one wanted i think with funeral services i mean we show all the signs of having gone just completely off the edge uh i mean um i i mean just this we turn this into something that's combination of abstraction and show you know uh and sometimes it's it's just sad and pathetic you know and of course people want to remember but it's like they're afraid of the real emotion you know what's supposed to happen to feel hey this is your chance to to cry in public go for it you know so play something that's genuine you know i mean there are plenty of good songs that you could sing at a funeral like together um when my mother died i basically went to the pastor of our church in alaska and said here's what i want to have happen and here's what i don't want to have that's very clear about that and yeah yeah i said i'm not even bringing any pictures of my mother to put on anything i am not uh because i it turns it into a show already well you're right and funerals are wow yeah well i'm sure you know oh yeah but but there's this weird way and i'd see this in the dominican republic so i'm working with haitians and these people i mean we are way out at the edge of the world in so many different ways and when they wanted to do something important they would often take the most gosh i don't even have the words for this um it was stuff within their reach but just barely and but but it seemed to have status and importance in the world and so you know if they could get their hands on some crappy sound system they would and you know i see this sometimes i'm gonna be careful what i say but i don't think anybody from these communities watches my videos but so i you know so i'll just tell the story so there's this nigerian anglican church that rents from us and if they have a special sunday because they rent from us for some reason they really want me to come and so i came to this one festival that they had and there was a she was quite clearly a nigerian immigrant who came here quite young and you're having sort of this festival service here in sacramento of nigerian immigrants and so there's sometimes christian pray there's anglicans sometimes there's anglican hymns sometimes there's contemporary christian praise and worship sometimes there's a song that they clearly brought over from nigeria right and then this young woman gets up to sing and she's singing an american country western song about a truck and a dog and i'm just kind of keeping an eye on the pastors because i'm thinking what the heck dude are they making of this going on here and they're kind of looking at each other and like is is is this okay i mean it's a dog and it's a and it's a love that didn't go right and it's drinking and cheating i mean she's and this is a nigerian immigrant singing this song and i'm just watching this thinking what is going on there's just layer on layer on layer and liver but now in some ways she is being 100 authentic but authentic to what i'm trying to do the math and i can't do it and and i had these kinds of experiences in the dominican republic all the time you're at the edge of the world but in a sense in order to achieve a degree of importance validation status they would try to reach for something in you know in the way of a york or you know something from this culture so that they could bring it in and appropriate it and and then there was one time when we we visited a church which was way out in the world and i was with pastors from the region so they're from the town so they're higher up in the status we get out to this church and usually they might have something they'd make into a drum or somebody to have a guitar or something you could scratch or shake you know and then be mostly audible but in this church they'd have basically they had some dude that was sitting there and he was accompanying the church kind of going bing bing bing bing bing just doing stuff out of his mouth and then i'm looking at the other pastors like i i you know i i've seen a fair amount but i haven't seen everything these other pastors have seen and these other pastors they're looking at it like what the heck is and we know we thought we had long drive back to the town and they're like you know what what was happening in that church but this is this is people this is the crazy stuff we do and and then okay so what's authentic well this is this goes back to rookmacher and rookmacher in his one of his discussions about art says we have lost a sense of decorum and by that he does not mean the decor on the wall nor the being proper he means the he says the old word was that things fit at a certain time in a certain way so that you know a funeral was a time for a certain kind of behavior a marriage or a harvest festival was a time for another you know but i've seen marriages and we could go off on that for a while weddings too yeah yeah weddings where it's just like you're just saying like you know it's like okay we're going to take this and this and this turn the cuisine art on and then make some really weird statements about how we'll be faithful till till whenever it's convenient to us and you know it's just very strange and part of what i've seen is that we no longer have the ability to put ourselves fully into for instance our words it's very easy for us these days to say all sorts of things like yeah i really want to do that or yeah i really loved it i'm going to come see you and then never go see you you know that that this sense of of commitment behind what we do so instead we have this almost cut and paste the word recombinant culture is something i've heard before which i think is interesting that you recombine elements over and over and over but that was also a hearkening to recombined dna and so you have this culture of it's really strange i mean i see the same thing developing here in georgia sometimes and that is you know like it's you know they don't have christmas the way we have christmas and i did a whole video on this on my georgian crossroads channel it was my biggest culture shock when i finally realized i'm not getting a silent night here you know so but what what you will find is they've appropriated certain things from the west like all that endless christian pop and not christian christmas pop music and you'll hear it in the malls and it'll still be playing in february that's interesting because they don't understand the context but you see what you're describing with the nigerians and what you're describing is is this strange world where you know and it's kind of like the we we invent all these little gizmos for sound or light or projection you know and we end up doing strange things with them now i suppose you could look at it all from the campy kind of you know this is all just so trashy and funny but i i think that ultimately by for instance uh a lot you know i i've told people hey if i die don't celebrate i don't have a celebration of my life please mourn you know because the celebration of the life of it's a way of getting around the fact that it's a sad event yeah well i think of like greg greg lowry he's you know his story with respect to christianity is very interesting and a definitive moment of that is you know so he didn't have a romantic group but he had kind of a mental relationship with a young woman and they went to this church and um you know she was just a rising star and things are going great and then she i think it was can't i don't remember exactly what it was but she died and the thing that sort of said thing that sort of pushed him over the edge in terms of the christian faith that he could no longer have anything to do with it was at her funeral they decided to do this whole celebration of life and she is with jesus and so here at this funeral we should all be happy and he looked at this situation and said this is this is a young woman brimming with potential potential full of life she had everything to give to the world and now she has died this tragic death we should be mourning this that's the only thing and and so you know it's but but but again when you look at this weird thing that happened in that you know that happened in christian communities i see it all the time i i hear it all the time people want to i i keep i have a very light hand with people with respect to funerals and weddings you know if you want to do it i'll yeah obviously i have limits but i i go a long ways with you um but you know but but it all does speak to you know and the question is okay what does it speak to what what is really going on with this insanity right well that's why i knew that the pastor at my church was not the person to be in charge of the wedding i knew he was just officiating right and so i said i'm the person in charge this is my mother and i want this to be a memorable and meaningful service and i did certain things i won't go into it all right now but when i was when it was done i had more than one person come up to me and say that was one of the best funerals i've ever been to and what i did was it was just like you know it was it was the service not much spice but the focus on you know i want to hear the bells i don't want anything happening during the bells someone once i i was at a service where they were ringing the bells and showing a slideshow at the same time you know the from the childhood and sure sure sure and and i'm sitting there going like yeah it just cuts the cuts the heart out of the bells you know the bells are really important well i think you have a sense of you had a sense of coherence that you understood the role that silence and the bells i mean decorum is the right word but but it's it's not just you know we sort of have okay this is the way to do a funeral now we're living in this world of of enormous pluralism and so you have all of these cultures that are just all seeping up from below but you had a you had a sense of coherence that's a okay this is how this is how within this time and space we're going to understand this time and the space and the music we're going to get all the elements and it's going to fit which is you know coherence is a key thing for a sermon for a film for a piece of music and and and you have a sense of that because you understood the elements and how they go here and what together they're designed to deploy and to produce well i also understand that the more media you put between things people events the more you cut the event impact down so like when i do puppet shows i don't even use a microphone you know it's just like it's raw sound make people get in to hear it and it works just because of the nature of the puppet show i wouldn't say that for everyone or that it's not a rule but but what i'm saying is that there is a way it well it all comes back to relationships that's a good rule that's a really good rule yeah for me one of the ways i've i've come to understand evil is that anything that breaks a relationship is evil anything that encourages a relationship but here's the problem it's much easier to do evil than it is to do good so i tell people say you're walking down a street like a busy street in new york city one block what can you do for anyone that is good that is truly a good thing well you you things like this you stop a person from being run over by a car but you can't know if you give someone money that that's not they're just not going to go drink the final bottle of booze and die you don't know the effect of that so that's like and so for me like in new york city the only people i give money to are the people i would form relationships with right right right you see that's so so but basically there's nothing you can't walk up to someone and go oh hi you look lovely today that could be interpreted so many ways wrong yeah you know you can't walk up to someone and say hey let's uh what's your name you look interesting let's talk you can't do that so but if you flip it around and you say what can you do for someone that's really going to they're going to remember it for the rest of their life and it's really going to be bad walking down that same street your your options are almost limitless you can push them into the road you can kick them you can just walk up and comment on their nose you can you can you know just do endless terrible things to them or even spiteful things or even just weird things that they will go like why did that person walk up to me and just start like dancing i don't understand it was weird you know they will remember this but not it it it hurts something and and in a sense evil goes with entropy evil increases the entropy whereas love is like breaks on the entropy and in fact my feeling is love isn't in the entropic world because love is in time and so love takes time faith takes time i guess the way i look at it is like people talk about faith how do you have faith and stuff i said well faith is like trust and trust takes time so you're not going to just say i believe instantly and suddenly you have faith you have to you know my relationship with god does not happen simply because i will it into being it has to be certain moments where i test that relationship so coming to georgia is one of those things moving to alaska was one of those things moving to new york is one of these things taking my first major puppet journey into europe was one of these things and what i discovered is it's never that it's as simple as you do this and oh everything is good now what i've learned is there's a moment when the test comes so once you've taken a serious uh choice as a result of your faith you will then immediately as i discovered when i got to alaska oh by the way you've got all your stuff in a container and if you don't pay up your bill oh and you were overweight so you owe another you know couple thousand dollars on if you don't pay that right away yeah you don't have a job but don't worry you have to pay that or we're shipping it back to seattle and we're going to sell all your stuff i said oh i knew god well enough by that going okay this is the test let's deal with this now you know it's the same with georgia i got here it's like oh didn't get the money from from uh the the french like i was supposed to the georgian job was turned out to be nothing and so that's you know but i say oh but you know what came out of that this my channel you know and i'm starting to get the kind of people writing to me now saying you know thank you so much for what you're doing you know and i wouldn't have done it probably had i not uh you know just i kind of saw okay they're giving me what i used to make in a day in the summer in alaska for a month so i better start thinking about something else here most people don't make minimum wage on youtube you really don't i mean the amount of uh as long as your videos are um and i saw your your your video on you know why you can't uh why you monetize monetize yeah but i am trying to start a uh crowd funder this week and i've just run into my first thing i don't know if i'm allowed to from georgia yeah so i i'm gonna have to get someone in uh back in america to bitcoin my friend to put get a get a bitcoin wallet that's the only way it's well i've got yeah but i've got to do a fundraiser to make the otherwise i'll never get my stuff here well but but again with bitcoin you can just you can just put up a wallet number and people can send you people can that's that's the easy yeah but i think most of the people i know are so low you know low tech that they just aren't gonna yeah well then you'd have to somehow convert bitcoin no no i'm gonna do a fundraiser i just have to get someone with an american number to because i tried to have the uh you know the code come through my phone here and it didn't so i figured like okay i need to do it through an american phone number yeah i'll work it out it's it's it's workable but i love it i love the way this conversation went though because i like you know what you what you really landed on here at the end you know that's some because you know when you say the more media you put between the events the more you cut the event down and then you talk about um you know anything that breaks a relationship is evil anything that encourages a relationship is good because when i when i look at you know when i look at the local church and when i look at you know now everybody in the united states has had this experience of or a lot of people have had this experience of being you know whether whether their church closed or stay out stay open it didn't really matter they started staying home you know there's some question right now in terms of churches that about a third of people might sort of just drop out of church just because they got out of the habit and you know so you have you have all of this stuff but and and when you go into a local church i mean i always have conversations with people that they're interested in christianity they want to get into a local church and you know they you know it would sort of be like i mean who of who of us would have joined our family if our families were consumer products you know think about that you don't you don't do that you're born into the sucker and you're you know you've got these two crazy parents and every parent is not at least to one degree or enough some are better than worse you know on and on and on but you're you're you're born and raised into this thing and i really like the way you did it because of course it's time you know and and that time shapes you and that time molds you for good or for ill but you know i didn't you know i i see all this i see all this stuff being used whether it's the kenny rogers gambler song or this country music song sung by a young nigerian teenager you know about cheating and drinking and dogs and pickup trucks in a church service you know i see all of this stuff but but at the same time and even a shine jesus shine in a in a really cringy funeral another part of me sort of looks around and says but but this is even even though it's a really bad uh to to that which they most desire and need i'm not going to i'm not going to curse them no because of their cultural poverty well well you know well that's the thing i've always tried you know it's like i've had people occasionally who point to me and say well what do you think of that oh no you don't really know but so i'll have to find a way uh to to say it politely without saying you know sometimes people can't handle it you know what what i'm thinking so but um i think that even you know god respects even our fallen attempts and in fact all of us are making fallen attempts that's right that's right and someone once said you know the church is really a hospital for sinners and and i would say and you never know who's in the next caught next to you you know recuperating and or what they're coming out of and they may not get all the way you know they may you know maybe i've come up with a few principles that are interesting but i know better than to think that you know that suddenly the world is going to adopt all the the best burn ideas and stuff like this but there was one point i wanted to make that i didn't make going back to the centrality of relationship as for me it's you see the the the in the materialistic science world the core of everything is matter right it's it's it but in information theory in the last uh 20 years or so they came up with an idea and the smallest uh unit of information is the bit and they say it comes from bit so that every it the smallest subatomic particle already has a bit a bit of a code with it and that to me opens up the fact that oh so what that means is there is a everything is already you know for instance there isn't like a like matter sitting off in a corner somewhere isolated on a slide you know somewhere in a bottle it is already already in a relationship so the the key to everything is not the the the centrality of everything is not this is why when people start telling me like well in this world you know how can you know if there's a god it's just like because everything is a relationship relationship is the core of everything not matter not even energy its relationship it's the thing that directs it all because it is all directed it's obviously all directed you know the reason i don't fall apart into a puddle of molecules and atoms is because it's it's all directed it's this is no accident and what's interesting and then that that that bit the fact that it's information at the core and not the uh the thing means that that opens up the door for the logos and the interesting thing about god is that god has revealed as the trinity is not static but is a relationship and so to me that means that whether it's science or whether it's religion relationship is the core and for us in our world in our lives time is the way in which we enter that relationship we don't know what it would be like in you know after our deaths we can't say that but what we do know is in in this world our i look at it as all being kind of a test and part of that test is are you willing to take the time are you willing to invest the time are you willing to take the time with people so even everything ends up being you know it's just like i have cats that come to my window here in georgia well i've got three of them that i'm committed to you know then there's tom cats that come around that look pretty evil to me it's just like you're gonna come and you're gonna just basically rape these cats and then you're gonna eat the babies no no i have no no love for you you're not good but it's the same with people you know it's just like i but you can't commit yourself to everybody so that there are certain there are lots of people who not homeless people but people often older people begging on the streets here and to be losing so i have one in every area i go to i see that person they get money because i can't give it to everyone because there's just too many yeah but i can and what i've noticed is if you do it to one person long enough they start noticing that it's you yeah and then they look up and they're starting to brighten a little like you've given you said you're important yeah yeah yeah you've given a lot more than the money yeah exactly yeah it's probably a good place to land the plane here yeah well well paul as always bern it's always a joy to talk to you to a sacramento and meet have a real meetup yeah well maybe one day i'll get to i'll get to georgia i'd love to said to me sacramento's map territory i'd love to visit georgia so oh yeah yeah yeah no i i think you'd probably get an awful lot out of coming here i'm sure i would we'll see what happens yeah yeah well have a good day i will have a good night all right bern sleep well okay bye bye
