The [[Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal (HPA) axis|HPA axis]] governs stress. [[Cortisol]] activates the [[Reticular Activating Formation|RAF]], which adversely affects sleep. It primes the brain to be alert, makes it hard to sleep, and makes the [[mind]] more distractable.

If you're trying to concentrate on one task, but your RAF is active, your brain is primed to pay attention to every sound you hear (like the sound of a snapping twig).

Cortisol activates the [[Immune system]], which releases [[white blood cells]]. They're itching for a fight with no threat to fight, so they end up attacking other parts of the body. [[Cortisol]] (& stress) can worsen [[Autoimmune conditions]].

We want a good level of stress - not too much, not too little - [[Eustress]].


[[Cortisol]] is a long term stress hormone that activates a lot of genes. It creates cellular machinery that allows us to deal with stress over a long period. It creates [[Adrenaline]] receptors. When we're in a prolonged state of stress, our body becomes more sensitive to adrenaline.
