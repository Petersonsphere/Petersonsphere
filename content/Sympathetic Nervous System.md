aliases:
  - SNS
---
A division of the nervous system that functions to produce localized adjustments (such as sweating as a response to an increase in temperature) and reflex adjustments of the cardiovascular system.

The mode of activity in our body when we're prepped for fight or flight. The adrenaline system; the survival system; the activity system.

When the SNS is active, heart rate can be elevated; blood pressure can be elevated. We route blood to parts of our brain like our danger & survival circuitry in our brain, as well as to our arms & legs. We pull blood away from things like our stomach & intestines. The body wants to prioritize danger calculations & the ability to run / fight.
