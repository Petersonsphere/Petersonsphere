We're seeing a rise in clinical [[ADHD]] diagnoses. Is this because more people have it, or we're catching more diagnoses which we used to miss? Chances are, it's both.

However, we are definitely observing a shortening in our attention span, which is an adaptation to technology. The trend is towards shorter form content. The brain is an efficient organ; as we consume more short form content, the brains ability to hold attention for prolonged periods of time diminishes.

#### Technology Habit Tips
Be very careful about phone use.
- *When work & recreation are shared on the phone, work can become recreation, & recreation can slip into work. Phones don't just distract us from work, they also allow us to work 24/7. This prevents our brain from ever getting a break, which leads to [[Burnout]].*
	- *Think about what you're training & signaling when you respond to work stuff outside of work hours.*

- Create physical separation from your phone. This prevents you from giving into fluctuating attention.
	*Physically avoid the phone during transitionary periods (notice anytime you reach for your phone) - watching tv, eating meals, going to the bathroom. Walk around your house without it.*
	*When you reach for your phone, you reward it for distraction with a [[Dopamine|dopaminergic]] hit & entrain it to not keep its attention in one place.*
- Don't sleep with your phone within arms distance. Leave it across the room, or in a different room if you have a habit of grabbing it at any time.
- Be careful about what notifications you receive. You might enjoy them, but be critical about what notifications do in your day, as well as over time. The simplest thing to do is turn notifications off entirely for anything that's distractable.
- Increase the barriers (friction) to activities that distract you. It shouldn't be simple to slip into either work or fun.
- Set alarms to interrupt streaming / scrolling type of stuff (gaming, YouTube, useless scrolling) that can suck you in before you start using it. After more time passes, we enjoy it less.
