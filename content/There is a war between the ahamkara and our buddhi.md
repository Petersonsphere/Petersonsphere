There is a war between the [[Ego|ahamkara]] and our [[Buddhi]]. They're clashing against each other. 
	When you talk to someone who's [[Ego|egotistical]] (even if their egotistical beliefs are negative, like "I'm a loser"), how logical are they? More importantly, how logical do they think they are? If you talk to someone who's emotional, how logical are they? More importantly, how logical do they think they are?

If you argue with someone who's [[Ego]] is active, you aren't going to get anywhere.
	It's like their [[Mind]] has this impervious shield of cognitive bias that swats away any argument, no matter how logical it is.
		We see this in political discussions, where both sides think they're 100% logical and the other side is 100% illogical.
		
People with big [[Ego|ahamkara]]s "bully" the [[Buddhi]].
	The [[Ego|ahamkara]] goes to the [[Buddhi]] and says "Hey listen, we're feeling really bad right now. Come up with as much **evidence** as you can so I can knock this other person down & then we don't have to feel this pain anymore. I gotta protect us from the pain & I need your help, [[Buddhi]]."		
		*For Example, we see this in [[rationalization]] all the time. In a case of infidelity in a committed relationship, the perpetrator will justify their behavior by coming up with reasons for why it was the other person's fault that they cheated.*
