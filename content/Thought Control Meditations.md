The next set of meditations will equip you with the fundamental skills of controlling your thoughts & your mind.
This set of meditations will focus on
- Awareness of thoughts
- Discarding thoughts
- Directing thoughts
- Holding thoughts
If we want to be motivated or stay focused on tasks, our mind must be able to do these things on command.

We want to practice **each** of these steps for 5 - 10 minters for a **minimum** of 3 days. There are more "advanced" types of meditation, but there's no benefit to jumping straight to those. We really want to entrain these earlier skills to lay the foundation for the later stuff.
	*If you're struggling with the meditations, or if you enjoy a meditation, you can do it more; the goal is to equip you with an understanding of the different functions of the mind & to learn how to practice them.*

#### Practice 1) Awareness of thoughts
- The first practice is to simply be aware of thoughts. Close your eyes and just notice when thoughts arise. Do not try to change, direct, or engage them. The key goal of this practice is to lay a simple foundation of training a capacity of awareness. We want to get solid with our ability to be aware of thought.
	*Notice that your mind will populate with thoughts. As long as you're aware of them, you may not slip into a chain of thoughts - where you have one thought that leads to another and then you're thinking about something. Do your best to just be aware of each thought as it arises. As each thought enters your mind, acknowledge it and be aware of it. Do this for a few minutes.*
		*You may have noticed a few things from doing this exercise; the first is that you might have been a bit bored, because you weren't doing anything. The more aware of your thoughts you are, chances are, the less bored you are. The second thing is that you may have gotten lost in a chain of thoughts. Notice that there is a difference between awareness of thought and getting 'lost' in thought. So, already, we have discovered something - if we get 'lost' in thought, then that must mean that we have lost awareness. As we practice being aware of thoughts, we'll protect ourselves against getting lost in thought.*

Practice for 5-10 minutes for at least 3 days, after a preparatory practice such as [[Om Chanting]].

#### Practice 2) Evoking thoughts
Prerequisites: Practice # 1 for at least 3 days.

Now that we're grounded ourself in awareness of thoughts, we're going to practice bringing thoughts - the skill of thinking about one thing, then a second thing, third, fourth, fifth thing, etc.

We're going to start to develop a relationship between the [[Indriya|Indriya]]s and the thoughts that we have.

Go to a setting where there are many things your senses can engage with (example - a park bench - a place with lots of sensory input). If you're at home, you can move back from your computer so that you can see the whole room.

- All we're going to do is look at different objects (each for ~10 seconds or so; maybe a bit more or less) & observe the thoughts which are evoked.
	*When you look at different objects, notice the different thoughts that come up. Shift your attention to looking at different things and notice all of the different thoughts that are evoked when you look at different objects. As we're looking at all of these different objects, our focus isn't on the object; our focus is on the thoughts that are evoked by the object. We don't want to linger on one object for too long. If you start to notice thoughts arising that are not related to the object you're looking at, then that's when you want to switch. We want to shift around so that we don't get lost in a train of thought. We want to shift around & use our senses to evoke essentially random thoughts.*
		*Notice that when you shift, you must abandon the thought. Pay attention to that discarding of thoughts as you move.*

Practice for 5-10 minutes for at least 3 days (after doing the previous practice for 3 at least 3 days).

#### Practice 3) Discarding Thoughts
Prerequisites: Practice # 1 & 2 for at least 3 days *each*.
Now do practice #2,but without indriyas and focus on simply discarding thoughts.

Close your eyes and as a thought arises, discard it.
- After you discard a thought, you create a space for a new one
- Allow as many random thoughts as possible
- Do your best not to engage with them
- The pace of thoughts may slow down

Practice for 5 - 10 minutes daily for at least 3 days.

#### More "Advanced" Practices
Prerequisites: After 10 days  of the previous meditations, you can do these practices.
	*If you want to "skip ahead", you will find it difficult and won't get as much out of it & will likely be a poor use of your time.


#### Evoke Positive Engaging Thoughts
You may notice that some thoughts are more engaging, stubborn, or difficult to shift away from.

- Start by evoking a positive thought that you are attached to,
	*Examples: memory that you are proud of, a sense of identity that you feel good about, or an accomplishment.*
- Now, discard it.
- Evoke another thought and discard it.

Practice for 10 minutes daily for 3 days.

#### Evoke Negative Engaging Thoughts
*Note: Be cautious about this if you have a mental health diagnosis and discuss with your provider before engaging in this practice.*
Prerequisite: 3 days of the previous practice.

- Evoke a negative thought - a thought that you get caught up in which emotionally hurts you.
	*Examples: it can be a situation in which you were wronged, a negative way you feel about yourself, or a negative experience.*
	*Do not jump into something extremely negative such as trauma or body image issues if they are very powerful.*
	*Practice shifting and discarding it.*
Evoke another thought and discard it.

Practice for 5 - 10 minutes daily for 3 days.
