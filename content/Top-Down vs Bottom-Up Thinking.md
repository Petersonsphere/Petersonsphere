There are 2 ways our brain directs our attention. These are methods of of information processing.
- Top-down
- Bottom-up

#### Top-Down
Governed by the [[cerebral cortices|cerebral cortex]]. A higher order "controller" "gives an order", and the rest of the brain "gets in line". Sends signals all throughout the rest of the brain. Sends signals to "do it's bidding". It suppresses the distracting signals (like, "I'm hungry", or "I forgot to do -this- today") when it's focused.

#### Bottom-Up
When you're walking & you see a snake, in this case, our [[visual cortices]] tells our [[cortices]] to cease activity. That visual bottom-up stimulus interrupts your top-down control, because there's a snake.

There's a constant communication between (or sometimes, a war) between your top-down circuit & your bottom-up circuit.

Example of a conflict: your phone dings due to a notification while you're [[studying]]. If the bottom-up processing wins, suddenly you're paying attention to the notification. If your top-down processing wins, you ignore it and focus on what you're supposed to be focusing on.

This is particularly important in the case of [[ADHD]], because they're more vulnerable to bottom-up stimuli.

"Oh snap, I have [[ADHD]], am I screwed?" - No, not at all.
Our ability to modulate top-down vs bottom-up processing is quite fluctuating & can be specifically trained.
	*Example: An evolutionary adaptation in neuroscience - parents who are new to parenting. Before you're a parent, your brain ignores kids who are crying (unless they're crying super badly) because your brain isn't primed to pay attention to them. When you become a parent, something changes in your bottom-up processing. You become hyper aware of quiet signals of crying (& other forms of distress) which previously wouldn't have broken into your attention. You also become much more aware of all other stimuli as they relate to kids. For example, your peripheral vision will interrupt your attention when (even) other people's kids start doing something dangerous.*

The amount of bottom-up stimuli in our world is drastically increasing. All of the technology companies are competing for your attention, and when they win, you pay the price in everything else you want to do with your life. Those apps aren't free. They use signals that take advantage of bottom-up processing. Today, most people feel like they have more [[ADHD]], even if they don't have clinical [[ADHD]]. Everyone feels this way because we can't focus like we used to.

Our brain is constantly taking in tons of stimulus. The only way your brain can alert you of a snake in your peripheral vision is if it sees the snake, first. Our brain is constantly suppressing most of the stimulus it's taking in.

#### Improve Top-Down Control
- [[Meditation]]
- Clean your environment - suppressing stimulus costs mental resources
	- Research has found that if you try to do [[Top-Down vs Bottom-Up Thinking|top-down]] thinking in a visually cluttered environment, the [[visual cortices|visual cortex]] is active, and it takes a portion of your mental energy to suppress all those visual signals.
	- When you [[studying|study]] in a noisy place, your [[Top-Down vs Bottom-Up Thinking|bottom-up]] circuit is getting bombarded & you can't study optimally.
