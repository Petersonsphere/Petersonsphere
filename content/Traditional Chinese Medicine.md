Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is thousands of years old and has changed little over the centuries. Its basic concept is that a vital force of life, called [[Prana|Qi]], surges through the body. Any imbalance to [[Prana|Qi]] can cause disease and illness. This imbalance is most commonly thought to be caused by an alteration in the opposite and complementary forces that make up the [[Prana|Qi]]. These are called [[Chandra|yin]] and [[Surya|yang]].
