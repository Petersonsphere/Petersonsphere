Things you care about. Things that matter to you. Come from within. When you care about something, you're much more likely to engage with it. How do you know the difference between something you want & something you care about?
*Example 1: Eating healthy. One group of people want to eat healthy as a desire. That means it requires a lot of willpower & effort to do, because it isn't natural. Another group of people care (are intrinsically motivated) about taking care of their body. Since they care about taking care of their body, it's also easier for them to eat healthy. If you ask them what they want to eat, they still want to eat unhealthy food, but they choose the healthier food instead of the tastier food.
Even though the goal can be the same (eat healthy), the origin of the goal will determine your level of intrinsic motivation towards it.*
There's some interesting research on values - there's an evidence based psychotherapy practice called [[Acceptance and Commitment Therapy]] which basically says that overcoming desires involves discovering what your values are and then starting to live in accordance with them.
