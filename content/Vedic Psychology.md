If we want to take control of our lives, we need to understand how our mind works. If we turn to western psychology, we get all kinds of different complicated answers. Becoming an expert at understanding the mind isn't about getting PhDs in complicated theories.

###### How the western perspective on mind was developed
The birth of [[psychology]]
[[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s methodology was to talk to people and listen to their words; based on their words he would make inferences about how the mind works. This is how science works. Science is all about sitting "on the outside" and looking "on the inside". [[x-rays]], [[blood tests]], & [[CAT scans]] use instruments on the outside to get an objective sense of what's happening. This is great for physical parts of medicine.
We don't have instrumentation for psychology to see what's objectively in the mind. [[Freud]] used people's words as an approximation for what's going on in their mind. This isn't a great approximation, because for every word you speak, there are 1,000 thoughts in your head. The approximations that we came up with by listening to words aren't simple & aren't very close to what's actually in the mind.

Another problem with Western [[psychology]] is that, in general, science is population based; not individual based. When we do scientific (& psychological) studies, we'll take populations of people and see what, on average, the minds of those people are doing. That's cool if we're thinking about a population; we can learn things about [[attention]], or [[memory]], but anything we learn from [[psychology]] won't apply 100% to you.

###### How Eastern psychology is different than Western psychology
The yogis didn't look on the outside at all. They didn't try to use any objective instrumentation. They sat down, closed their eyes, and observed their own thoughts. You're the only person who can directly observe your thoughts & emotions. You understand exactly how angry you feel; whereas, a psychiatrist from the outside can understand that you're feeling angry, but can't know how angry you feel. Or how long you've been feeling angry. The quality of information that we have objectively (looking from the outside to the inside) is so much worse than what we have subjectively when we look at ourselves.

The yogis used a subjective methodology. The theory that they came up with is so much simpler than the Western theories, and arguably, much more encapsulating (if you buy it) of how the mind works.
Example - a clinical psychiatrist trying to explain to someone they have an [[Oedipal complex]] is super complicated. On the other hand, the Vedic model can be taught to kids. When it's taught to people, they can understand how their mind works, not in 5 years of study, but in one hour.

There are 5 parts of the mind,
- [[Manas]]
- [[buddhi]]
- [[ego|Ahamkara]]
- [[samskara|Samskara]]
- [[Citta]]

Note that the quality of the ([[Ahamkara]]) (my identity as a programmer, for example) is a completely different quality of stuff than an emotion ([[manas]]) or analytical reasoning ([[buddhi]]).
