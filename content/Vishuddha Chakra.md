Throat Chakra.

Situated at the base of our throat, it is about affecting change in the outside world.

The Yogis conceptualized that our throat is how we effect the outside world. If we want to make a change in the outside world, the voice is the most powerful organ to do that.

Vishuddha Chakra practices are about effecting (affecting?) external changes.

If you're seeking a goal like a promotion, or to convince people of things, you should do Vishuddha Chakra practices.
