Derived from the Sanskrit words “yam” (meaning “to control”) and “tra” (meaning “tool” or “instrument”), a **yantra** is a geometric figure or diagram representing an energetic or spiritual aspect of the universe.

A [[tantra|tantric]] symbol of power. The [[tantra|Tantrics]]]] believed that when you meditate on them, they harness / cultivate various cosmic spiritual energies.

This yantra has lots of different colors and shapes. We're going to use these colors and shapes to train our attention to go where we tell it to.

A lot of what holds us back in life is our mind not obeying when we tell it to do something, like [[studying|study]] a book, our attention wonders all over the place.

You can select whatever Yantra you want based on what kind of spiritual energy you want to cultivate.

We're going to train our attention by staring at the center of the Yantra for awhile, and then moving it to other places.

#### Yantra Meditation
This is phase 2 of [[Trataka]] practice, which is [[Trataka]] on a Yantra.

When we close our eyes, we can notice the screen of our mind, or [[Akash]] (which is in our [[citta]]). It is almost like a monitor in our brain, where we can visualize things, imagine things, or see after images.
	From a biological perspective, our eyes have pigments called rhodopsins that become exhausted when we stare at something too long. As a result of rhodopsin exhaustion, we see “after images” that include the negative or opposite color of what we were gazing at. Internal trataka leverages these principles to create a visual object for us to focus on in the mind. This practice also teaches us [[Vairagya]].

#### Example Yantra Meditation (TODO - guided meditation?)
- Stare at the center for awhile & aclimate. For this entire exercise, keep your gazed fixed on the center. Don't look away.
- While looking at the center, answer, "what color is on the outer edge?"
	- *Getting the right answer doesn't matter. We're just trying to train our attention. Notice that you have to concentrate to be able to discover which color is at the furthest outer edge. It's this concentration that is the purpose of this exercise.*
- Once you notice the color of the outer layer, now move in a layer.
- Then, move in even more.
- Then move in further (for the example Yantra provided above, a ring of a particular color)
- Then, move in towards the pedals
- Then, move in to the next layer of pedals (red).
- Then, to the blue triangles. Focusing just on seeing the pattern of the blue triangles.
- Then, to the red triangle.
	- *Notice that it's starting to get easier to notice the color, shape, & pattern; so be it.*
- Then, to the black triangles.
- Then, to the green.
- Then to the yellow triangle. Notice that this one is easy.
- Now, we're going to move back out.
- See the green triangles color, pattern, and shape.
- Then, out to the black.
- To the red
- To the blue
- To the red pedals
- To the yellow pedals
- Then, a ring
- Then green
- Then the borderlines. Notice the yellow. Notice the brown.
	- *Which really start to blur together*

Now, what we're going to do is close our eyes & see our [[Chidakasha]]. See that pattern & hold it in your mind. Now we get to the tricky phase of the practice. See how it morphs & changes shape and color. See that it's hard to hold in your mind. It requires a certain kind of relaxing to allow it to float to the surface. Stare at it. It may start to move or wonder. With the right kind of effort, you may be able to bring it back into focus.

Now, relax your mind. Let go of the image. Let it go. Notice the tension. You've been concentrating hard for the last few minutes. All of your mind has been focused. Let it relax. Put your palms together in front of you (in a Namaste position). Let the touch. Rub them together. Feel the friction; warmth; heat. Put them over your eyes. You may notice that the image floats to the surface again. Let it go. Take a deep breath in. As you exhale slowly, open your eyes.

That is [[Trataka]] with a [[Yantra]].
