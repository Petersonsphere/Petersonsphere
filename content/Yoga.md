The Tantrics discovered [[tantra]] and molded their discoveries into Yoga.

Yoga is about discovering how we are connected to the infinite consciousness.

There's a cosmic consciousness ([[Brahman]]). Ex: "I'm a piece of the divine."
We are tiny droplets that come out of that ocean & get trapped in these bodies. As long as we exist as a droplet, we have our own unique identity.
For example, if I pull a water droplet out of the ocean, that water droplet has its own identity. It's from the ocean, but it's no longer part of the ocean, but it has its own individuality. By re-merging with the ocean, we lose our individuality and become one with our source. This is the general goal of Yoga.

The yogis realized that not all people are the same.

The Yogis discovered that there are four ways that we can connect with the infinite:
1) [[Bhakti]] Yoga
For example, the path of Bhakti Yoga is right for someone with a devotional or religious temperament.
2) [[Karma]] Yoga
Some people are do-ers (social activists). By trying to take social action we can purify ourselves & move 1 step closer to enlightenment.
3) [[Jnana]] Yoga
Some people are more intellectual in nature, & can use contemplation to logic your way towards enlightenment.
4) [[Raja]] Yoga, also known as [[Raja|Ashtanga]] Yoga.
