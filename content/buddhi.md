(b äd-dhi)

The intellect (part of the mind). Capacity for reasoning. Critical thinking. Analyzing. The buddhi also does things like scans your [[memory]] and retrieves the right kind of thing at the right time. It is also our capacity to process and digest emotions.
	*When you sit down & take a math test, the buddhi sifts through all of your memory and knowledge and retrieves the right things for you to do the math test*

Fundamentally different than the [[manas]] (reflexively liking or disliking something).
