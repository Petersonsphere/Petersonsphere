(Chit-tuh)

Means, "the screen of the mind". It gets translated into "the unconscious mind", but it isn't really unconscious. Literally the translation is "the backdrop of the mind".
	*It's like the sky. The sky isn't really an object. It's the place where the sun, and the moon, and stars will appear, at times. Citta is the backdrop of our mind, and at any given moment, maybe the [[manas]] is active. Maybe the  [[buddhi]] is active. Maybe our [[ego|ahamkara]] is active.*

[[samskara|Samskara]]s are stored in the citta and then sometimes become active.

The citta is the screen on which all of the other parts of our mind "play".
