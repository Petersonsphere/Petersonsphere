A steroid [[hormone]] that your adrenal glands, the endocrine glands on top of your kidneys, produce and release. helps regulate stress, and has effects on metabolism and immune response.

Cortisol gets your entire body ready for a stressful encounter. Cortisol's function is to keep us alive in stressful times (longer term).

For example, if you run away from a tiger, you'll still want to sleep lightly that night so that you're ready for a second encounter if the tiger follows your scent.

Cortisol release activates the [[Reticular Activating Formation (RAF)]].
Cortisol release Hyperactivates our [[immune system]] (sends signal to be on high alert).
