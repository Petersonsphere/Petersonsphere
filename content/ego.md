(Uh-hum-kah-ruh)

Our sense of identity. Ahamkara gets translated as "the feeling of 'I'", or, "the 'I' feeling".
	*When we think about ourselves, we think about certain characteristics (race, age, profession, gender, etc.)*

Ego comes from **without** (a sense of value that's derived externally).

Ego comes from **success**.

One of the key things the ego does is compare.

The ahamkara pumps us up & puts others down.
