*These transcripts were created by using Whisper to transcribe audio files to text.*
*The 20 Most Similar box is something I made which uses AI Vector Embedding models to represent the semantic (not lexical) meaning of a document.*

Resources
- I use this website to watch a video next to its transcript & easily jump to the timestamp I want - [YouTube Transcript - read YouTube videos](https://youtubetranscript.com/)
	- Get the YouTube Video ID from the transcript title (example: "\[knEZN9U-9xc\]").
	- If no transcript is displayed, it is likely because the video author has not configured the enablement of transcripts for that video.
