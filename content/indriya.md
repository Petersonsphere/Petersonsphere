The five sense organs.
- Sight

- Smell
- Taste
- Touch

If we want to act rightly in life, we need to manage thought, because actions come from thought. Shaping our thoughts in the right way involves 2 things -
1) How do we manage / manipulate them?
	- Hold them
	- Pick them up
	- Put them down
2) The origin of thought - we need to understand where thoughts come from in the first place (which is fundamentally sensory impressions).

Thoughts come from 3 places:
###### 1) Indriyas
The first place thoughts come from are the indriyas (sensory impressions).
Whatever movie / game / album thing that you're excited about right now originated from your sense organs. People 2,000 years ago weren't excited about this thing, because it didn't exist. Your thoughts had to enter through your sense organs. This suggests that if we're careful about our sense organs, we'll cultivate the right kinds of thoughts.
	The goal of the field of advertising is to populate your thoughts, using sensory inputs. If we can manipulate the thoughts in your head, we can manipulate your behavior. The thoughts in our head come from our sense organs. We know this scientifically
		*Lots of studies have been done on alcoholics; getting sober for alcoholics is very difficult. Spending time where their sensory inputs are different is helpful (avoiding bars / friends who drink, spending time in AA meetings / retreats) - what they get exposed to sensorilly is an important aspect in their recovery.*

Startup incubators can be good sensory environments for wanna be entrepreneurs.

###### 2) Associations
The second place thoughts come from are associations (memory, emotion).
Thoughts don't just come from pure sensory impressions. Our mind also attaches things to sensory impressions.
	*Example: a child who grows up in a toxic household. Maybe they get told certain things; when someone says something mean, it isn't just a mere sensory impression; it gets laid down in memory and we attach emotions to it. Sensory impressions come with associations. The formation of those associations will generate certain thoughts.*
Take 2 stimuli for 2 different people; say someone calls you an "idiot." The emotional impact (association) with that sensory input is different for the adult vs the child.

These associations can shape behavior and the course of your entire life. [[samskara]]s get formed & can create all kinds of problems (self esteem problems, etc). If we want to control our fears & anxieties, we need to understand where they originated from.

###### 3) Transcendental Thought, or, "creative inspiration"
This point is more mystical and is included for completeness.
As the yogis approached "higher states of consciousness", from this "other place", they would sometimes get thoughts. Flashes of inspiration or creativity. Sometimes we connect dots or things will "make sense" to us. Those things can't be tied to an experience or the memory of an experience. As we cultivate different states of mind, we'll start to have thoughts that originate from "other places," rather than sensory organs. We can use sensory organs to patch things together - we can create a new story from old archetypes. But, sometimes it's possible to have a truly original idea which seems revolutionary. When you talk to artists and hear them describe their process, they say things like their inspiration comes from "the outside". There's this idea that true genius is not a person, but is something that affect you. It's a temporary state of mind, or, higher level understanding. This is what we're going to call transcendent thought. We won't be focused on it, though; it's the end result of creative processes (it doesn't have to be meditation).

Now that we understand the importance of senses for creating thoughts, the next natural step is to train our sensory organs. The more we train our sensory organs, the more we'll create a filter on what thoughts populate our [[mind]].
