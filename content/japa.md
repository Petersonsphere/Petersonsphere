Stage 1 of mantra practice is to **clear everything out of your mind** (not to put something into your mind) & make the conscious mind calm.
	If you repeat the mantra over and over again, it acts as a [[dharana]] & will push out all of the other thoughts.
Then, when the [[consciousness|conscious]] is mind is calm, then stuff can start to sink into your [[unconscious]].
