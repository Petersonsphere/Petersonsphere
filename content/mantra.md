Chanting phrases of power repeated over and over, to create a particular kind of effect. Oftentimes with prayer beads.

The subject of mantra blends psychology & how we know the [[mind]] works with esoteric stuff.

The system of mantra says that the universe has one basic unit ([[Brahman]]), and that there are particular oscillations. When you oscillate at a particular frequency, you will create a particular thing.
You'll create matter or energy if you oscillate at a particular frequency.
You'll create things like gravity, or human beings, or thoughts through oscillations at different frequencies. The practice of mantra is about combining those oscillatory frequencies to create a particular manifestation.

A lot of times, people will choose a mantra (in English) that cultivates some idea that they want to tell themselves (affirmations, etc). But traditionally, mantras aren't random phrases; they're specific phrases. When specifically combined, they have specific effects.

#### Different ways mantra effects the [[mind]] (& even works beyond mind)
Related: [[Nature of Mind]]
We have a [[consciousness|conscious]] [[mind]] & an [[citta|unconscious]] mind.

[[Positive thinking]] generally doesn't produce transformation (it doesn't change us much).
Mantra practice isn't about the power of [[positive thinking]].
The problem with mere positive thinking is that it's [[consciousness|conscious]]; nothing sinks into the [[citta|unconscious]].

###### Stage 1 of Mantra Practice: [[japa]], calming the mind
A mantra can act as a [[dharana]] to calm ([[japa]]) the conscious mind.

Related application - You [[studying|study]] better when you're calm because information more easily gets past the [[consciousness|conscious]] [[mind]] & into the [[citta|unconscious]], better.
	When you're distracted, you re-read the same thing over & over again & it doesn't "stick".

###### Stage 2 of mantra practice: the mantra facilitates a [[dhyana]] which implants into the unconscious, & then generates thoughts for you
Once the mantra is implanted in the unconscious, it will start to "generate up" from the [[citta|unconscious]] to the conscious, & it will start to populate your thoughts.
	*Example: clinical addiction psychiatrists often see patients suddenly snap out of addictions when they realize that enough is enough. When asked, "how did you come to realize that 'enough is enough'"? The always have a very emotionally focusing experience.
		Anecdotal Example: The first time a particular patient held their newly born child for the first time, all thoughts suddenly fled their [[mind]] & their [[mind]] was dominated with the thought 'enough is enough'. The next day when they woke up & they looked at their liquor cabinet, that [[indriya]] gave them the thought, 'let's have a drink' like they had done every day before for the last 10 years. But suddenly, out of their [[citta|unconscious]] [[mind]] the thought 'enough is enough' arouse.*
	*During these transformational experiences, the [[mind]] is always very calm*

###### Stage 3: Achieving [[samadhi]]. The spiritual level of mantra practice. Cultivating cosmic forces to create manifestation in life.
This is the ultimate goal of mantra. We will now depart far from science and entering into esoteric territory.

The [[tantra|Tantrics]] believe that the universe is composed of cosmic consciousness, and that when it's directed in a particular way, or, when it has a particular oscillation, it leads to a particular manifestation of reality. This is the level at which mantra is supposed to work. You're playing with the cosmic building blocks of reality & you're generating some kind of weird spiritual, energetic vibration which manifests in the real world in a particular way.

The tradition of mantra has mantras about attaining certain things in this life. Like mantras for health, wealth, & success. If you chant them diligently with the right frame of mind, it will actually work like a magic spell in this life.

Mantra works to cultivate a particular kind of [[shakti]].

Think about times when you "bent the universe to your will". For some people, it isn't a mental thing that drives them forward. It's like there's some gravity in their life that is pulling them towards a certain goal. And, that gravity has a mental component. It's a drive. It's a thought that, every day when they wake up, they think "I want to be / do this / this is the life I want." They're very focused, disciplined, & motivated; there's definitely a mental component. But it also seems like the universe kind of "gets in line" with them, like there's a spiritual gravity that pulls other people and circumstances along with them. It's as though your [[Karma|karma]] / circumstances / luck are being shaped by this force. It's like this force is conspiring to create opportunities for you. That's the level at which mantra practice works.

###### "How do I get a Mantra?"
You can start by chanting "Om" ("A-U-M"), but the real answer is that you'll be given a mantra by a guru who knows who you are. You need to find a very qualified teacher. Someone who knows you, what your spiritual inclination is, and what you need.
In the absence of that, start with "Om", & rely on your [[Karma|karma]]. When you're ready, a teacher will present themselves & give you the mantra.
