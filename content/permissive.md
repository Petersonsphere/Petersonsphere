In medicine & biology, something that's [[permissive]] is something that allows or facilitates something else to act. This is something that is very well understood in medicine & physiology. Some hormones have permissive effects on other hormones. That means hormone A will set things up for hormone B to function properly.
	*Example: female reproductive hormones. The relationship between estrogen & progesterone. Estrogen creates receptors on cells for progesterone to attach to. Without estrogen, the signal of progesterone cannot be received.
	Another example is in [[Stress Physiology]] - Cortisol is a long term stress hormone that activates a lot of genes. It creates cellular machinery that allows us to deal with stress over a long period. It creates adrenaline receptors. When we're in a prolonged state of stress, our body becomes more sensitive to adrenaline.
	In culinary, salt "brings out" other flavors. Sometimes improving flavor doesn't involve bringing in more spices, sometimes bringing the salt level up in food allows the flavors to "shine".*
