The practice of sensory withdrawal, or, sensory control.

To meditate, one-pointedness of the mind involves restraining our sense & being able to put our attention where we want it to go, instead of chasing after sensory stimuli.

Example: fidgeting, hunger, moving, physical discomfort, etc.

A lot of your impulses are rooted in your sense impulses. If you want to get control of your life & mind (because the two go hand in hand), you have to get control of your sense organs.
