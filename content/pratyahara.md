The practice of sensory withdrawal, or, sensory control. The fourth step in the [[Eight Limbs of Raja Yoga|eightfold path of Raja Yoga]].

Pratyahara is a set of techniques that teaches us to restrain our sense organs, or [[Indriya|Indriya]]s.

To meditate, one-pointedness of the [[Mind]] involves restraining our sense & being able to put our attention where we want it to go, instead of chasing after sensory stimuli.
	Example: fidgeting, hunger, moving, physical discomfort, etc.

A lot of your impulses are rooted in your sense organs. If you want to get control of your life & [[Mind]] (because the two go hand in hand), you have to get control of your sense organs.

**Distraction** makes it harder for you to focus.
	All forms of input stimulus contribute to distraction; oftentimes unnoticed. Think about some times when you're driving in your car and you have to turn down the radio, or ask people to stop talking so that you can focus better. Sight and sound are actually related.
Notifications on your phone vie for our attention. 

Generally speaking, we don't experience attention in its purest state. In fact, we strive for the opposite - for our attention to be **fractured / dissipated** into many different things.
	*Watching tv & being on your phone at the same time; eating a meal and watching something at the same time. We actually organize our lives to fracture our attention through different sense organs at the same time.*

**The more that we distribute our attention across the senses, the weaker each of those things become.**
	*The effect of fracturing your attention is bad for both things your attention is on. If you watch tv while studying, you don't get 50% of your studying done & have 50% enjoyment, you just get little studying done & get little enjoyment.*

The more attention that is focused to one sensory organ, the more powerful it becomes in an **exponential** manner.
	*A 5W LED light bulb can dissipate it's energy in a bunch of directions, but a 5W Laser can cut through stuff. Attention is like this.*

Controlling our sensory inputs & organs is more important than ever. Distraction is of the mind. Some stuff from the East has crossed over to the west, like [[Mindfulness]] and yoga [[Asana]]s, but this constitutes only ~5% of the whole meditative tradition. There are lots of meditation techniques that are designed for specific control of the mind. [[Mindfulness]] is about observing, cultivating non-judgmentalness, & being in the present, but it isn't about controlling our [[Mind]] or [[Indriya]]s.

Pratyahara is about controlling our sense organs; by controlling our sense organs, we will control our attention. Once our attention is in control, we can direct it in specific ways to yield positive results.

 We need to understand the relationship between our senses and our attention. The best way to do this is actually through boredom. As humans, there are some things & experiences that are shared across cultures all over the world; one of the most shared experiences that we have is that we all hate being bored. What happens when we're bored? Our mind is bouncing around, looking for a way to be entertained, & we engage our senses to push our attention into a particular direction.
	 *If I'm bored & I start watching something, that's a sensory input that takes my attention and now I'm focusing over there on whatever I'm watching, & I'm no longer bored.*
Sensory organs & attention go hand in hand; when there's no sensory input, we're bored because our attention has nowhere to go.

As we retreat away from boredom, this creates a real problem. Rather than controlling our sense organs, we're using an external thing as a crutch to pull our attention somewhere. As we become more vulnerable to boredom, we lose control of our lives.
	*When we reach for a smartphone app to direct our attention, it quickly becomes a crutch where we no loner direct our attention to it; it pulls our attention & we start to lose control over our attention. We get into a vicious of not being able to tell our [[Mind]] what to do.*

To overcome some of the [[Addiction]]s of the sensory world & to direct our thoughts in positive ways, it starts with control over the sensory organs, which can be achieved through the practice of pratyahara.

Pratyahara practices will trim / reduce each sense, one by one, until we're ready for [[Dharma|dharma]].
After that comes [[Dhyana]]. It's the opposite of boredom. [[Mind]] is looking for a sensory outlet.

As we trim all 5 senses away & are left with unadulterated attention, we have an absence of [[Mind]] & boredom. All of the things that come with mind, also go - [[Dukkha|suffering]], like fear, and [[Ego]] melt away, which has a liberating effect. As we enter the state of pure attention & our troubles go away, our ability to act becomes much more potent. Much of our what prevents us from acting are things like [[Ego]], attachment, and emotions - anxiety from consequences. If we want our mind to obey us, we need to get rid of all of that stuff, which starts with [[pratyahara]].

In the [[Bhagavad Gita|Gita]], [[Krishna]] tells [[Arjuna]] his attention is like a chariot being pulled by 5 horses; if you're in control of your sense organs, they'll go where you tell them. If the horses are in control, you will be pulled apart into different directions. As our attention gets pulled in different directions, our mental ability is diluted. As we control our mind, we become more peaceful & [[Productivity|productive]].
