The practice of sensory withdrawal, or, sensory control. The fourth step in the [[Eight Limbs of Raja Yoga|eightfold path of Raja Yoga]].

Pratyahara is a set of techniques that teaches us to restrain our sense organs, or [[indriya|Indriya]]s.

To meditate, one-pointedness of the [[mind]] involves restraining our sense & being able to put our attention where we want it to go, instead of chasing after sensory stimuli.
	Example: fidgeting, hunger, moving, physical discomfort, etc.

A lot of your impulses are rooted in your sense impulses. If you want to get control of your life & [[mind]] (because the two go hand in hand), you have to get control of your sense organs.
