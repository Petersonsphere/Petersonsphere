###### Procrastination isn't a problem, it's a solution.
Which equation makes more sense to your brain: work for 30 days & get an 'A', or chill for 28 days, cram for 2, and get a 'C'?
If you look at neuroscience, everyone procrastinates. Things that everyone does aren't bugs, they're features. It's how we're designed to function. Procrastination is an efficient strategy. It's a way to allocate your resources to do a good enough job in a relatively small amount of time.
The problem is that our society doesn't work like this. We don't distinguish ourselves by getting a string of C's. Chilling for 28 days & getting a C might be good for the 28 days, but it isn't the most winning strategy for 5 years later.

###### We treat procrastination as though it's monolithic
Diagnostically, this is very poor.
	If you go to a doctor and say "I'm sick", depending on what sickness you have, there are different solutions.
Procrastination isn't diagnosed very specifically.
There are discrete kinds of procrastination.

###### 1) Idealistic Procrastination
Perfectionists will procrastinate. They won't start until they can do it right. A lot of people don't start because they aren't ready. Some people would rather have 100% of failure than a 20% of success. They need to do things perfectly, otherwise they won't do it at all.

We need to understand the nature of perfection, and the nature of readiness.

Why does the mind want to be perfect? It comes down to the [[Ego]]. When you do something perfectly, no one can criticize you for it; you do it better than everyone else. We don't want to open ourselves up to criticism; we don't want to feel bad about our work. If no one can say anything bad about you, you don't have to hear bad things about yourself, & your [[Ego]] is preserved.

This person has something to compensate for. They have to make up for something they did in the past. It makes their work challenging.

Another way to think about that is readiness. People don't want to act unless they're ready. This seems like it kind of makes sense, but the problem is, what does readiness even really mean? And, what does readiness help us do? It means I'm confident I'm going to do a good job. Readiness protects us in the same way perfectionism does. I know something will go well, therefore I don't have to deal with the consequences of it going poorly. Readiness paralyzes us. Eternally preparing & never doing.

How do we 'just do it?'
First, we have to do work on our [[Ego]] to okay with not being perfect.

The solution to idealistic procrastination is in [[Ego work]].

###### 2) Avoidance Procrastination
Tends to be more emotional in nature. Our brain doesn't want to do something because of the emotions involved.
	*Ex: fear of judgment from parents*

If something is bad, why don't we just "get it over with"? Like ripping a band aid off. We know what we *should* do, but we're avoiding something. What are we avoiding? 90% of the time its some form of negative emotion.
	Our brain's job is to protect us. "Don't tell them because they're going to disapprove of you and that's going to hurt."

How do we deal with avoidance procrastination? Emotional digestion and awareness.

First, we need to become aware of what it is we're trying to avoid.
	In the moment of delaying a task, tunnel down & ask yourself *why* you're procrastinating.
		*We often try to force ourselves to work. We never seek to understand. We only seek to change. Try to understand.*
		*What is the consequence I'm trying to avoid? What is the emotion I'm trying to avoid? What is my brain trying to protect me from?*
Tons of studies show that as we [[Vairagya|detach]] from our emotions, we're able to engage with them better. As we understand them better, we're able to overcome them more easily.

The problem with avoidance procrastination is that we aren't even aware of this powerful emotion that's controlling our behavior. And if we aren't aware of it, we can't fight it. All we do is think we're lazy, so we go doom scrolling for solutions externally. Instead of looking *out there*, we should be looking *inside*.

###### 3) Operational Procrastination
Sometimes we don't engage in a behavior because our brain can't figure out how to do it.

Researchers did studies to figure out who would actually study for a chemistry test. What kind of thinking correlates with getting an 'A' on a chemistry test? They discovered 3 kinds of thoughts.
	The first kind of thought was, "I want to get an 'A'". This [[Correlation coefficient]] was 0.36 with getting an 'A'. Decent, but not very powerful.
	The second kind of thought was, "I need to study for the chemistry test". It wasn't the goal they wanted to achieve, but rather, that they "need to do". This thought also had about a 0.36 [[Correlation coefficient]] with getting an 'A'.
	The third kind of thought was what they call an "implementation thought" which had a 0.65 [[Correlation coefficient]] with getting an 'A'. An example of an implementation thought: "I'm going to study for chemistry on Wednesday at 3:00"

**If you want to engage in a behavior, your mind needs to think, not about goals, but about implementation.**

The larger the goal, the more overwhelming it is; the brain doesn't know how to break it down, & the worse the operational procrastination gets.

The solution to operational procrastination is to break larger goals into lots of implementable steps. We call this technique [[Operationalizing a problem]]. The more that we use an *external* process to break a task into individual components, the easier it is to execute.
	That has even become a job - project management. A project manager takes a big project & breaks it into small steps; this is how things get made.

Simple technique: Reverse engineer it. "What is the last final step?" Then work your way backwards from that.
	Ex: "Find a job"
		Accept a job offer > Negotiate an offer ... here are all the variables to negotiation... > I need to get a job offer > I need to interview well ... get clothing in order; do research; study; update resume > I need to accept an interview invite > I need to be offered an interview invite > I have to apply for a job > How do you figure out which job to apply for? ... friends, network, LinkedIn, etc. > Need to find available jobs > Need a resume > Start by reading other resumes, finding a resume format.
Okay, now we have tasks to do. Which of these do you want to do on Monday? On Tuesday? On Wednesday?
