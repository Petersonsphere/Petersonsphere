Resistance emotions. Self-sabotage. Habits that hold us back in life. Motivation struggles.

One of the confusing things about motivation is that we know what's good for us, but fail to bring ourselves to do it. We think we lack motivation.

The world of self help that promises more motivation doesn't work because they're treating the wrong problem. We don't have a lack of motivation; we're highly motivated, just in the wrong direction.

*Example: a heroin addict struggles to quit despite knowing of severe financial, career, & relational consequences from substance use. The worse the consequences got, & the more important it was to stop, the more this person used.
The worse this person's life got, the better a solution heroin was. The person was highly motivated to solve their problems, it's just that heroin was the best solution, for a few hours at a time.*

The influence of emotion on behavior is way stronger than logical reasoning. Logic doesn't motivate behavior.

What motivates behavior is emotion. The centers of our brain that govern emotion are tightly connected to the centers that manage learning, behavioral control, & motivation.

Reasoning comes from the [[cerebral cortices]]. The emotional circuitry in our brain is right in the middle, next to where we learn, & next to where we get motivated towards action.

Emotion drives & catalyzes behavioral change.

The [[hippocampus]] is tightly connected to our [[amygdala]].

Emotions are like the override switch for behavior. If the [[amygdala]] activates, it overrides any kind of logic.
	The [[amygdala]] is responsible for a performer who can easily perform something they've rehearsed a ton, fails to perform "on stage".

Our experience of lack of motivation is usually emotionally neutral. When you feel a lack of motivation, what you usually do is distract yourself. It isn't like you sit there & think about "going to the gym" & then don't go to the gym. You evoke a certain amount of distraction. Why? Why do we evoke distraction? What are we distracting ourselves from? We evoke distraction to distract ourselves from the emotion to begin with. That's exactly why we don't feel it. If you do sit there for a minute & feel the emotion some amount of fear / frustration / shame will arise if we let it. But, our brain protects us from that with distraction.

If you find yourself with a lack of motivation & engaging in distraction when you try to do something, the missing link there is a sub-surface emotion. The stronger the emotion, the stronger the lack of motivation.
	*Example: A student got COVID & procrastinated on sending a simple email to their professor asking for an extension on a deadline. Despite having a good excuse, this student procrastinated on sending the email because they felt shame about it.*

Shame holds us back. Example: [[Imposter Syndrome]]. The emotional override switch is irrational, & we know this. Emotions are, by definition, irrational.

Our motivation gives in to emotion & protects us from our emotions becoming reality.

"I'm tired" is one of the most common culprits of this. "I'm tired" doesn't actually negatively affect our performance very much. The human body can still do a lot when tired. When does tiredness keep you from doing something? That's a clue that the tiredness could be camouflage for emotional resistance underneath. You need to look for the resistance; but, you probably won't feel this strong emotion, initially. Chances are, as the emotion arises, your mind will protect you from it by engaging in distraction. FMRIs look at the blood flow in the brain, & when we engage in distracting activities, we reduce the blood flow to the negative emotional circuitry in our brain.
