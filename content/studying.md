The more calm your [[Sakshi Bhava|conscious mind]] is, the easier it will be to learn.

If you're calm, the thing you're reading will "sink in" through the [[Sakshi Bhava|conscious mind]] & you'll learn (meaning it will be implanted in your [[citta|unconscious mind]], to be recalled later).

#### How to study efficiently
###### Adapt your [[circadian rhythm]] to your biology
Use the hours of [[Brahmamuhurtha]] to read stuff before class; then class isn't about learning stuff. Class is about solidifying the things you do understand & the [[mind]] can pay more attention to the things you don't understand. Then, whenever you're exhausted, like by 3pm or something, you can just chill for the rest of the day while everyone else is struggling like worms in the library.

Keep your morning yoga super light.

###### What science says about dawn & dusk hours
Dawn & dusk is beautiful. Why? Why do the colors at sunrise & sunset seem vivid & lush? It isn't just the sun that's beautiful. If you look at things like trees, you'll notice different shades of green. Your visual acuity is the highest at dawn & dusk. Humans evolved to be the most active at dawn & dusk. Wherever there are mammals that function, they're most active at dawn & dusk. Our bodies & brains have evolved to have the most activity at that time.

There's a simple experiment you can do - pick a spot that has different shades of green (trees, grass, etc) & look at all the shades of green at night. See how many shades you see. Then, look at it at noon. Then, look at dawn or dusk & see how vivid the greens are. Simply because our bodies have evolved to function during that time.

If you're a night owl, after 5/6/7pm, we have another period of high mental acuity. You can have a second efficient push at the end of the day.
	*Caveat: teenagers have their circadian rhythm shifted forward a few hours. Teenagers' brains are wired to come online at like 7/8/9 am.*

If [[Brahmamuhurtha]] doesn't work for you, then just find what does.

###### Create the right environment
Your [[mind]] can be very habitually oriented. If you create the right studying environment, it will prime your [[mind]] to study really well.
Cut out distractions.
Silence your phone & put it far away from your work area.
Play particular kinds of music before studying or during studying.
Light an incense. This is great for [[Meditation|meditation]], because nothing anchors the [[mind]] as well as the [[indriya]] of scent. Essential oils?

###### Spaced Repetition
Going through stuff over and over and over again is inefficient.
Our [[mind]] has some RAM (temporary memory) that gets solidified into our more permanent memory in the [[hippocampus]]. That solidifying process happens when we [[sleep]]. Take naps. Taking breaks can also help with solidifying studying.
Give the brain more time & chances to consolidate short term memory into long term memory.

###### Restrict your studying time
Your [[mind]] loves to procrastinate. If you give yourself an endless amount of time, your [[mind]] will not be efficient in using it. When you restrict your time, it will change the way you approach the time. You have to actually respect the boundaries you set.

###### [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] perspective on studying
If your primary [[dosha]] is:
	[[vata]], you may need more frequent breaks.
	[[pitta]], you can start mid-morning, work for like 8 hours, but then need to call it quits around 4 or 5 pm.
	[[kapha]], can benefit from marathon study sessions. Slower to get going, but have the highest top speed.

Ultimately, figuring out your protocols is going to be a journey you will have to undertake & figure out yourself.
