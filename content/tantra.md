The Tantrics - the group of people in ancient India that discovered [[tantra]].
Tantra - The Teachings of the [[Tantrics]].

The Tantrics believed the universe is made of cosmic consciousness (or, [[Shiva]]), and cosmic energy (or, [[shakti]]).

For anything to be manifest in the world, we need an intention (a goal, a direction), and some kind of fuel, or energy, to make it happen.

The Tantrics discovered 3 kinds of practices that are aimed at harnessing this cosmic energy to make a manifestation in the real world:
1) [[Mantra]]
2) [[Yantra]]
3) [[Yajna]]

By practicing these 3 things, the Tantrics figured out what the nature (or, the 'spiritual clay') of the universe is. They took their discoveries and molded them into [[Yoga]].

There are some differences between [[Buddhist Tantra]] & [[Hindu Tantra]].
